Abstract
Background: As the third enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase (6PGDH) is the main generator of cellular NADPH. Both thioredoxin reductase
and glutathione reductase require NADPH as the electron donor to reduce oxidized thioredoxin
or glutathione (GSSG). Since thioredoxin and GSH are important antioxidants, it is not surprising
that 6PGDH plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Furthermore the activity
of 6PGDH is associated with several human disorders including cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
The 3D structural investigation would be very valuable in designing small molecules that target this
enzyme for potential therapeutic applications.
Results: The crystal structure of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH/Gnd1) from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined at 2.37 Å resolution by molecular replacement. The
overall structure of Gnd1 is a homodimer with three domains for each monomer, a Rossmann fold
NADP+ binding domain, an all-α helical domain contributing the majority to hydrophobic
interaction between the two subunits and a small C-terminal domain penetrating the other subunit.
In addition, two citrate molecules occupied the 6PG binding pocket of each monomer. The intact
Gnd1 had a Km of 50 ± 9 μM for 6-phosphogluconate and of 35 ± 6 μM for NADP+ at pH 7.5. But
the truncated mutants without the C-terminal 35, 39 or 53 residues of Gnd1 completely lost their
6PGDH activity, despite remaining the homodimer in solution.
Conclusion: The overall tertiary structure of Gnd1 is similar to those of 6PGDH from other
species. The substrate and coenzyme binding sites are well conserved, either from the primary
sequence alignment, or from the 3D structural superposition. Enzymatic activity assays suggest a
sequential mechanism of catalysis, which is in agreement with previous studies. The C-terminal
domain of Gnd1 functions as a hook to further tighten the dimer, but it is not necessary for the
dimerization. This domain also works as a lid on the substrate binding pocket to control the binding
of substrate and the release of product, so it is indispensable for the 6PGDH activity. Moreover,
the co-crystallized citrate molecules, which mimic the binding mode of the substrate 6phosphogluconate, provided us a novel strategy to design the 6PDGH inhibitors.

Background
The 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH, EC
1.1.1.44) is the third enzyme of the oxidative branch of
the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway has two
major functions: the production of ribulose 5-phosphate
which is required for the nucleotide synthesis, and the
generation of NADPH which provides the major reducing
power essential for protecting the cell against oxidative
stress and a variety of reductive biosynthetic reactions,
particularly lipid production. Both thioredoxin reductase
and glutathione reductase require NADPH as the electron
donor to reduce oxidized thioredoxin or glutathione
(GSSG)[1]. Since thioredoxin and GSH are important
antioxidants[2], it is not surprising that 6PGDH plays a
critical role in protecting cells from oxidative stress.
Recently there is renewed interest in this pathway since it
has been shown to play a central role in tumor proliferation process[3,4]. The 6PGDH catalyzes the oxidative
decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) to ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) and CO2 with the concomitant
reduction of NADP+ to NADPH[5]. This reaction is similar
to those catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and
malic enzyme because all three yield a ketone, CO2, and
NAD(P)H as products. However, unlike the other
enzymes, 6PGDH is metal-ion independent[6].
The enzyme 6PGDH has been reported to be involved in
several human diseases, including cancer[7] and Alzheimer's disease(AD)[8], through various studies over the
last three decades [9-11]. One of the correlations between
6PGDH and these diseases is oxidative stress. As we all
know cancer is a genetic disease. Oxidative stress induces
DNA damage including modified base products and
strand breaks that may lead to further mutation and chromosomal aberration of cancer. Although it remains an
open question as to whether oxidative stress is a causative
factor or a consequence of AD, the correlation between
oxidative stress and AD is well established[12]. Many evidence suggested that increased oxidative damage is an
early event in AD[13]. As a compensatory response to elevated brain oxidative stress, the activities of 6PGDH were
increased in AD[8].
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic 6PGDHs are generally
homodimers, with a monomer of ~470 amino acids and
a molecular weight of ~52 kDa[14]. Each subunit is comprised of an N-terminal Rossmann fold coenzyme-binding domain, a large all-helical domain and a small Cterminal tail. The active dimer assembles with the C-terminal tail of two subunits threading through each other.
The coenzyme binding domain of 6PGDH has an α-β-α
fold, while the substrate 6PG was located in the cleft
between the α helices of one subunit and the C-terminal
tail of the other subunit of the dimer. As expected from
their essential biological functions, the amino acid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/38

sequences of 6PGDHs from various organisms show significant conservation. The complete 6PGDH sequences
from five different species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sheep, Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Trypanosoma brucei, were aligned using the programs
MultAlin[15] and ESPript[16] to show the conservation
among species (Figure 1).
The kinetic mechanism of the enzymes from sheep
liver[6,17-20] and from Candida utilis[21] has been studied in detail. A considerable number of factors are capable
of modifying the catalytic activity of 6PGDH. From the
sheep liver 6PGDH, the oxidative decarboxylation reaction was reported as asymmetric in terms of ordered product release: carbon dioxide first and NADPH last, while
the favored binding order for NADP+ and 6PG is dependent on the buffer system used. In phosphate buffer, it
seems that NADP+ binds to the enzyme before 6PG[6],
but in triethanolamine (TEA) buffer at pH 7.0 it seems
that an initial complex composed of the enzyme and 6PG
is dominant. In either buffer product release is in the same
order with carbon dioxide leaving first, followed by Ru5P.
Multiple isotope effects have been used to interpret the
sequential mechanism[22]. However, a recent investigation under a wider range of conditions suggests an acidbase mechanism[23,24]. The general base accepts a proton from the 3-hydroxyl group of 6PG concomitant with
hydride transfer and then shuttles the proton between
itself and the sugar oxygen throughout the reaction, ultimately accepting it as ribulose is formed. The general acid
presumably plays a role in only the last of the three steps,
namely, the tautomerization of the enediol of ribulose 5phosphate to the keto product[25].
Due to the potential importance of 6PGDH in human diseases and medicine (i.e., development of selective inhibitors for therapeutic approaches), it is crucial to better
understand its molecular function through the 3D structural studies of this enzyme from multiple species[26]. So
far 6PGDH crystal structures have been solved in the three
species (sheep[27,28], T. brucei[29] and L. lactis[30]).
Since yeasts are comparatively similar in structure to
human cells, both being eukaryotic, in contrast to the bacteria and archaea, we examined the structural and biochemical characteristics of 6PGDH in S. cerevisiae, which
is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model
organisms.
In S. cerevisiae, the open reading frame YHR183W/GND1
encodes the major isoform of the two 6PGDHs, named
Gnd1, accounting for approximately 80% of the total
6PGDH activity, whereas Gnd2 encodes the minor isoform[31]. Gnd1 displays very high similarity to Gnd2
(86% identity). In this study we overexpressed, purified
and characterized Gnd1 in E. coli. Moreover, we deter-

mined the crystal structure of Gnd1 in complex with two
citrate molecules by molecular replacement and refined it
to 2.37 Å resolution. Based on the comparative structural
analyses in combination with the enzymatic kinetics studies, we obtained more insights into the molecular mechanism of this enzyme, especially the structure-based
function of the C-terminal domain.

Results and discussion
Overall structure
The overall structure of the dimer of S. cerevisiae 6PGDH/
Gnd1 enzyme with two molecules of citrate is illustrated
in Figure 2A. The structure of Gnd1 (PDB code: 2P4Q)

was determined by molecular replacement using sheep
6PGDH as the starting model (PDB code: 1PGP). The
structure was determined at 2.37 Å resolution. The final
model of each monomer contains residues 1–476, two citrate molecules and 212 water molecules (Table 1).
All the calculations of rotation function and translation
function were conducted using the program MOLREP[32]
in CCP4 (Correlation coefficient: 53.5%). Refinement
was carried out using the programs O and crystallography
and NMR system (CNS)[33]. Through the refinement we
identified two unexpected electron clouds in the catalytic
pocket as citrate molecules used in crystallization. It

appeared that two citrate molecules were bound to the
enzyme in each monomer (Figure 2A[34], for more
details see Figure 3A).
Similar to the 6PGDHs reported in other species, Gnd1
forms dimer. Each subunit has three domains (A, B and C
in Figure 2B). Domain A includes a typical dinucleotide
binding motif-"Rossmann Fold" (residues 1 to 127) and
two additional α/β units (residues 128 to 175) which
form the N-terminal α/β "co-enzyme binding" domain.
This domain exhibits high similarity to other NADP+
binding domains such as the 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (HIBADH) from Thermus thermophilus
HB8[35], with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of
2.3 Å. This data substantiates previous phylogenetic evidence that 6PGDH and HIBADH may share a common
evolutionary origin and enzymatic mechanism[36].
Domain B consists of residues 176–433 and is almost
exclusively helical in structure(αH-αT). Domain C (residues 434 to 476) contains one helix (αU) and one loop
(Figure 2B). The two all-α domains contain most of the
residues involved in substrate binding and dimerization.
The dimer is formed by the C-terminal tail of two subunits
threading through each other forming a mobile lid on the
substrate binding pocket.
The penetration of the third domain through the other
monomer in the biological unit indicates a concerted
folding pathway of the monomers during the translational or post-translational process. Although the mean
average temperature factor of Gnd1 is as high as 49.1, we
still found a difference of temperature factor among the
three domains, which are 58.0, 42.5 and 53.5 respectively.
This is consistent with previous observations from the
structures of 6PGDH from sheep liver and protozoan par-

the absence of dinucleotide co-enzyme[28,29]. Gnd1 and
6PGDH of sheep liver both have smaller dimer interface
of around 5500 Å2 compared to the 6PGDH of T. brucei,
which is around 6300 Å2. This is likely due to fewer residues (109 and 115 vs 134 amino acids) involved in the
monomer-monomer interactions of the yeast Gnd1 and
sheep 6PDGH[29].
Through the analysis of the surface potential, it is obvious
that dimerization is not completely due to the interaction
between the C-termini of each monomer. In fact, the

interactions between the hydrophobic groups of Domain
B of each monomer contribute the majority to the dimerization.
The binding of two citrate molecules
To our surprise, two citrate molecules were bound to the
active site of each Gnd1 monomer (Figure 3). In citrate
FLC1, Oγ2 replaced the water molecule (HOH528) in the
structure of 6PGDH-6PG complex (PDB code: 1PGP),
hydrogen bonded to Oξ2 of Glu189 and formed a salt
bridge with Nη2 of Arg286. OHβ was located within 4 Å
from His452 and Arg446 of Chain B, thus its negative
charge is balanced by these two residues. In citrate FLC2,

Oα2 interacted electrostatically with His452 in Chain B,
while Oα1 did not form any hydrogen bonds, nor salt
bridges, with other residues. The role of O3 in 6PG was
substituted partly by Oγ1, interacting with Asn102; and
partly by Oγ2, interacting with Asn186 and Lys182. Oβ1
and Oβ2 located at the same place of O1α and O1 in 6PG
respectively. And the position of O2 in 6PG was replaced
by OHβ, interacting with Gly129 and Gly130.
By superimposing Gnd1 to the sheep liver 6PGDH (PDB
code: 1PGP), we found that the two citrate molecules
occupied the space of one molecule of 6PG (Figure 3C).
Moreover, the interactions and residues involved are strik-

ingly similar[37] (Table 2). Although citrate has as many
carbon atoms as 6PG, it is highly branched which reduces
its effective length to about half that of 6PG. The negative
charges between two citrate molecules lead to electrostatic
repulsion, so they occupy a larger space than 6PG (Figure
3D). However, this electrostatic repulsion could be compensated for by hydrogen bonds around the active site of
Gnd1.
Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) has
re-emerged as a major health threat in Sub-Saharan Africa
which caused by parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei[38]. 6PGDH emerges as a potential drug target in this
disease[39]. Previous study has shown that citrate serves
as an inhibitor of 6PGDH[40]. Structural studies of
6PGDH will definitely facilitate the development of
6PGDH inhibitors for potential therapeutic use. Our current research provides for the first time the conformation
of 6PGDH bound with an inhibitor.
The mutant proteins Gnd1ΔC35, Gnd1ΔC39 and
Gnd1ΔC53
The yeast Gnd1 consists of 489 residues, with the residues
after Ser434 forming a small C-terminal domain.
Sequence comparison of the Gnd1 with the corresponding enzymes derived from sheep, E. coli, L. lactis and T.
brucei revealed the substrate-binding residues to be identical in all these species, but the sequences of the C-terminal
tail are not well conserved, especially the region of residues 457–489 (Figure 1). From the structure of Gnd1 we
found two highly conserved residues, Arg446 and His452,
to be vitally important for citrate binding. These two residues were also shown to be critical for 6PG binding from
structural studies of sheep liver 6PGDH[28]. The residue
Arg446 was reported to play an important role in anchoring substrate while 6PG is oxidatively decarboxylated to
ribulose 5-phosphate[41]. In an attempt to understand
the potential function of the C-terminal tail on the dimerization and enzymatic activity we generated mutant Gnd1
with C-terminal 35, 39 and 53 amino acids deletions.

These proteins, designated Gnd1ΔC35, Gnd1ΔC39 and
Gnd1ΔC53, which contain residues 1–454, 1–450 and 1–
436, were overexpressed and purified, respectively.
Gnd1ΔC35 contains both conserved residues (Arg446
and His452), while Gnd1ΔC39 contains only Arg446, and
Gnd1ΔC53 is a complete deletion of the entire C-terminal
tail (Figure 3B).
Despite the fact that all of the truncated enzymes were soluble and could be purified by Ni2+ chromatography and
gel filtration using a Superdex™ 200 column, none of
them had detectable enzymatic activity (data not shown).
It suggests that the intact C-terminal tail is vitally important for the enzymatic activity, even the region of residues
454–489 is not conserved among different species, nor
directly interacting to the substrate 6PG or its homologs.
In addition, through purification and crystallization we
found that Gnd1ΔC53 is less stable than the full length
Gnd1, although the mutant proteins still dimerized.
Obviously the dimerization was not completely sustained
by the C-terminal tail. This is the first data to suggest that
the C-terminal tail of 6PGDH is dispensable for dimerization. In fact, the interactions of the hydrophobic groups of
the Domain B, which are mostly composed of helices, are
the major driving force for the dimer formation. However,
the C-terminal tail contributes a part to maintaining the
stability of the protein.
Km values for the Gnd1
Detailed kinetic analyses of the 6PGDHs from T. brucei[42], L. lactis[41] and sheep[18] have previously been
performed. Earlier studies showed 6PGDHs from different species exhibit very similar binding mechanism with
the natural substrate, with only minor differences in the
Km for the substrate and the coenzyme[43]. As we know,
sequential reactions (both random and ordered) are characterized by lines that intersect to the left of the 1/v axis in
Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot, while in PingPong reactions the lines parallel. To further validate the
previous findings, we determined the Km values of Gnd1
at pH 7.5 and the ionic strength of 0.03 (Figure 4). The
kinetic parameters were determined by varying the concentration of each substrate (in the range 0.1–0.5 mM for
6PG; 0.05–0.4 mM for NADP+). It is obvious that in each
plot there was an intercept to the left of the 1/v axis, as calculated from Figure 4A and 4B. Double-reciprocal plots of
enzyme rate measurements as a function of substrate concentration indicate Km values of 50 ± 9 μM for 6PG, and
35 ± 6 μM for NADP+ at pH 7.5. The initial velocity pattern
of Gnd1 intersects to the left of the ordinate, suggesting a
sequential kinetic mechanism which is in agreement with
that of the enzymes from other species. Kinetic analysis of
this enzyme would also indicate the same mechanism of

Conclusion
The 6PGDH is an important enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway and has been linked to several human diseases. Here we provide the X-ray structure of S. cerevisiae
6PGDH/Gnd1. The tertiary structure of Gnd1 exhibits a
high similarity to 6PGDH in other species, as well as conserved substrate and coenzyme binding residues. Kinetic
studies suggest a sequential mechanism for Gnd1. However, our structure reveals for the first time the binding
mode of two inhibitory citrate molecules in the Gnd1 substrate binding pocket, which provides clues for the development of specific inhibitors against 6PGDH. We further
studied the role of the Gnd1 C-terminal tail and found
that it is dispensable for dimerization, but crucial for the
enzymatic activity.

Methods
Cloning, expression and purification
The YHR183W/GND1 gene was amplified by PCR using
the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae strain S288C as the template. An additional sequence coding for a six-histidine
tag was introduced at the 5' end of the gene during PCR
amplification. The PCR product was then cloned into a
pET28a-derived vector between Nde I and Not I restriction
sites. Expression was done at 37°C using the transformed
E. coli Rossetta (DE3) strain and 2 × YT medium (OXOID
LTD.) supplemented with kanamycin at 30 μg/ml and
chloramphenicol at 34 μg/ml. When the cell culture

reached an OD600nm of 0.6, protein expression was
induced with 0.2 mM IPTG (BBI) and the cells were grown
for a further 4 hrs. Cells were collected by centrifugation,
suspended in 30 ml buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol and
stored overnight at -20°C. Cells were lysed by three cycles
of freezing/thawing and sonication. The His-tagged proteins were purified using a Ni2+ affinity column with
standard protocols. Eluted protein was further purified by
gel filtration using a Superdex™ 200 column (Amersham
Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200
mM NaCl and 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The purity of
the pooled fractions was checked by SDS-PAGE and the
integrity of the protein samples was confirmed by mass
spectrometry.
The DNA sequences of GND1 without the sequence coding for the C-terminal 35, 39 and 53 residues (Gnd1ΔC35,
Gnd1ΔC39 and Gnd1ΔC53) were amplified, respectively.
PCR products were purified using the DNA gel extraction
kit (V-gene, China) and inserted into pET28a-derived vector. The mutant proteins (Gnd1ΔC35, Gnd1ΔC39 and
Gnd1ΔC53) were overexpressed and purified respectively
as described above.
Crystallization of Gnd1
Crystals of Gnd1 were obtained at 15°C by the hangingdrop vapour diffusion method. For crystallization, the
protein concentration was 17.3 mg/ml, in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl and 20 mM
β-mercaptoethanol. In each drop, 1μl of the protein solu-

tion was mixed with 1μl of the reservoir solution and the
mixture was equilibrated against 0.5 ml of the reservoir
solution (1.28 M tri-Sodium Citrate at pH 6.5). Crystals
with a maximal size of 100–200 μm appeared within 3
days. For data collection, the crystals were frozen in liquid
nitrogen after soaking in cryoprotectant buffer containing
30% glycerol and 1.28 M tri-Sodium Citrate at pH 6.5.

Data collection and structure determination
The crystal was flash frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas to
110 K. In total 102 images of diffraction data were collected using MAR345dtb detector (MarResearch, Germany), with wavelength of 1.5418 Å and oscillation of 1
degree. X-ray crystallographic data were processed using
AUTOMAR. The structure was determined by molecular
replacement with the program MOLREP[32] using the
structure of 6-PGDH (PDB code: 1PGP) as the initial
model. Crystallographic refinement was performed using
programs O and CNS[33]. The final model consists of residues 1–476 for one monomer that are visible within the
electron density and 212 water molecules. Structure factors and the coordinates have been deposited in the PDB
(code: 2P4Q). The final statistics and refinement parameters are listed in Table 1.

WWH cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized the protein, and performed the activity assays. YW performed
data collection, structure determination and structurefunction analysis. WL refined the structure. CZZ coordinated all the components of the project, and provided
financial support. WWH and CZZ wrote the paper. All
authors have read and approved the final manuscript.

Enzymatic activity assays
The assays were performed at 28°C by measuring the initial rate in the direction of oxidative decarboxylation of
6PG. To calculate the specific activity, NADPH production
was measured at 340 nm in a MODEL U-2800 UV-VIS
spectrophotometer (HITACHI). The enzymes containing
30% glycerol were conserved at -80°C. The standard
enzyme assay solution of 200 μl contained (final concentrations): Gly-Gly buffer (50 mM, final pH7.5); MgCl2 (10
mM); NADP+ (0.6 mM); 6PG (2 mM) and enzyme (4.8
nM). All buffers used were prepared with deionized and
distilled water. All assays were performed at least in duplicate; means of replicates were used as single points in subsequent statistical analyses. The enzymatic activity of
Gnd1, Gnd1ΔC35, Gnd1ΔC39 and Gnd1ΔC53 was measured respectively, as described above.

Determination of kinetic parameters
The catalytic activities of Gnd1 were assayed by measuring
the absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm, as described above.
The reaction rate (v) and substrate concentration were
plotted in a double reciprocal manner to calculate the
kinetic parameters. The kinetic parameters of wild-type
enzyme Gnd1 were determined by varying the concentration of each substrate (in the range 0.1–0.5 mM for 6PG;
0.05–0.4 mM for NADP+) for five fixed concentrations of
the other. The assays initiated by the addition of the
enzyme. Values were then calculated from LineweaverBurk plots with the respective slope and intercept replots.
