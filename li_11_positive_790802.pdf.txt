Abstract
Background: Since its emergence in March 2009, the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus has posed a serious
threat to public health. To trace the evolutionary path of these new pathogens, we performed a selection-pressure
analysis of a large number of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences of H1N1 influenza
viruses from different hosts.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both HA and NA genes have evolved into five distinct clusters, with
further analyses indicating that the pandemic 2009 strains have experienced the strongest positive selection. We
also found evidence of strong selection acting on the seasonal human H1N1 isolates. However, swine viruses from
North America and Eurasia were under weak positive selection, while there was no significant evidence of positive
selection acting on the avian isolates. A site-by-site analysis revealed that the positively selected sites were located
in both of the cleaved products of HA (HA1 and HA2), as well as NA. In addition, the pandemic 2009 strains were
subject to differential selection pressures compared to seasonal human, North American swine and Eurasian swine
H1N1 viruses.
Conclusions: Most of these positively and/or differentially selected sites were situated in the B-cell and/or T-cell
antigenic regions, suggesting that selection at these sites might be responsible for the antigenic variation of the
viruses. Moreover, some sites were also associated with glycosylation and receptor-binding ability. Thus, selection at
these positions might have helped the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to adapt to the new hosts after they were
introduced from pigs to humans. Positive selection on position 274 of NA protein, associated with drug resistance,
might account for the prevalence of drug-resistant variants of seasonal human H1N1 influenza viruses, but there
was no evidence that positive selection was responsible for the spread of the drug resistance of the pandemic
H1N1 strains.

Background
As of August 1st, 2010, the pandemic influenza H1N1
2009 had caused at least 18,449 deaths worldwide in
more than 214 countries [1]. It has been reported that
influenza A viruses are capable of infecting 30% of the
world population within a single month owing to their
rapid inter-personal transmission ability, thus posing a
serious threat to public health [2]. Therefore, there are
compelling reasons to investigate the molecular evolution of H1N1 influenza A virus to improve its prevention and control.

Influenza A virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae
family, with a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome composed of eight gene segments [3]. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two envelope
glycoproteins that are responsible for attaching the virions to the host receptors, determining pathogenicity,
and releasing newly produced viral particles. To date,
influenza A virus has been classified into 16 HA and 9
NA subtypes and more than 100 HA-NA combinations
have been identified in avian hosts [4]. Notably, HA is
cleaved into HA1 and HA2, with HA1 being the major
target of human immunity against influenza A virus
[5,6]. Meanwhile, mutations at NA sites are associated
with drug resistance; for example, H274Y and N294S
confer resistance to oseltamivir [7].

The comparison of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitution rates is the most common approach used to
determine the existence of positive selection. Interpretations are normally made with reference to the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio (ω = dN/
dS) [8], where the rates dN and dS are the numbers of
nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions per site,
respectively. The ratio ω measures the selective pressure
at the protein level. Values greater than 1 suggest that
nonsynonymous mutations offer fitness advantages to
the protein (individual) and have higher fixation probabilities than synonymous mutations [9].
There have been several studies investigating positive selection on H1N1 influenza viruses. Wolf et al.
[10] reported that from 1995 to 2005 there was no
clear selection pressure acting on seasonal human
H1N1 HAs. However, Shen et al. [11] analysed H1N1
influenza viruses isolated from 1918 to 2008 and
found strong diversifying (positive) selection at HA1
156 and 190. The residues 190 and 225 are critical
determinants of the receptor-binding specificity of A/
H1N1 HA, with human viruses favouring D190/D225,
swine viruses favouring D190/G225 and avian viruses
favouring E190/G225 (D190 means that the amino
acid at position 190 is D, aspartic acid. This notation
is used throughout this paper.) [12]. Recently, Furuse
et al. [13] reported that selection pressures acted differently on the pandemic 2009, seasonal human and
swine H1N1 strains. In addition, it has been reported
that positive selection was responsible for the spread
of the oseltamivir-resistant variants of both seasonal
H1N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses
[14].
Although the above studies are helpful in explaining
the evolutionary characteristics of H1N1 influenza
viruses, some questions remain. First, although there
have been many reports concerning the positive selection pressures on the HA and NA proteins of human
H1N1 influenza, the relationship between the positively
selected sites and antigenic variation of the virus
remains unclear [11,14]. Second, the mature HA protein
has two subunits, HA1 and HA2, connected by disulfide
linkage [5]. Some previous authors have also studied the
HA2 subunit [10,13]. For example, Wolf et al. [10] performed a positive-selection analysis of the full-length
HA gene sequences of the H3N2 and H1N1 to study
the interpandemic evolutionary trend of human influenza A. However, there has been a lack of detailed
description of a site-by-site positive-selection analysis of
this subunit. Third, swine H1N1 influenza viruses have
evolved into two separate lineages, the North American
lineage and the Eurasian lineage [15,16]. These two
lineages were the respective sources of the HA and NA
of the pandemic 2009 virus [17]. However, Furuse et al.

Page 2 of 9

[13] did not distinguish between them. Thus, positiveselection pressures on the two swine lineages are not
clear. Fourth, H1N1 influenza viruses also circulate in
birds. However, no analysis of positive selection has
been conducted for avian H1N1 influenza viruses.
To address these questions, we performed a positiveselection analysis of full-length HA and NA genes of
H1N1 influenza viruses available in GenBank. Our analysis offers some insight into the evolutionary trends of
H1N1 influenza viruses.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis

The HA phylogenetic tree constructed using Dataset1
contained five clusters of lineages (Additional file 1,
Table 1). Cluster 1.1 included strains isolated from avian
hosts. Cluster 1.2 mostly consisted of strains from North
American swine. Cluster 1.3 largely contained strains
from Eurasian swine, whereas cluster 1.4 was the seasonal human H1N1 lineage. Cluster 1.5 mainly included
viruses isolated from the pandemic 2009 strains. The
pandemic 2009 strains were more closely related to
those from North American swine.
The phylogenetic tree of NA genes revealed relationships similar to those observed in the HA tree, with one
exception (Additional file 2). The pandemic 2009 strains
were related to viruses from the Eurasian swine lineage
rather than the North American swine lineage.
Analysis of positive selection

Global ω values showed similar results for both HA and
NA. The global ω values were below 1.0 for all five clusters, which indicates that there is no detectable positive
selection on the gene as a whole (Figures 1 and 2). The
ω values for human strains were higher than those for
viruses from other hosts. In particular, the ω values of
the pandemic 2009 viruses were the highest. ω values
for the seasonal human H1N1 and the pandemic 2009
H1N1 lineages were higher than those for viruses from
Eurasian and North American swine which, in turn,
were similar to each other. Avian strains yielded the
lowest ω value.
Further site-by-site tests of positive selection helped to
identify the specific sites that were not detected by the
global positive-selection analysis. Results obtained by the
single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) and fixedeffects likelihood (FEL) methods were very similar
(Table 1). Specifically, for HA genes, positive selection
has been detected to act on viruses belonging to different clusters, North American swine, Eurasian swine, seasonal human, and the pandemic 2009, with each having
1, 1, 8, and 9 positively selected sites, respectively, in the
FEL analysis (Table 1). However, there was no evidence
of any positively selected sites in the avian cluster.

In these columns, B indicates that the site lies in the B-cell antigenic regions [18]. G means that it is a potential glycosylation site. T indicates that the site lies in
the T-cell antigenic regions [19]. R indicates that it is a receptor-binding site [11]. We use the same numbering strategy as Deem and Pan [18] and start
numbering from the amino acids DTLC.

Among the positively selected sites in viruses from the
seasonal human cluster, 7 positions are located in HA1
and all of them fall within B-cell antigenic regions, while
1 position is located in the T-cell antigenic region in
HA2 [18,19]. In particular, positions 160 and 162 are
potential glycosylation sites and positions 187 and 222
are associated with receptor-binding ability [11].
Furthermore, for the pandemic 2009 isolates, 5 sites are
located in HA1 and 4 in HA2. Among them, positions
186, 222 and 261 lie in the B-cell antigenic regions,
while 261, 411, 451, 460 and 530 lie in the T-cell antigenic regions [18,19]. Furthermore, positions 160, 186,
187, 222 in HA1, and 399 in HA2 are related to the
host shift of the viruses from birds to humans [20].
Overall, for the seasonal human lineage (1.4), the FEL
analysis shows that all 8 of the positively selected sites
lie within the T-cell and/or B-cell antigenic regions,
whereas for the pandemic H1N1 lineage (1.5), 7 of the 9

sites under positive selection are located within the Tcell and/or B-cell antigenic regions.
The SLAC analysis of the NA gene sequences showed
fewer sites under positive selection than the FEL analysis (Table 2). However, many of the positively selected
sites detected by the SLAC method were also found to
be under positive selection in the FEL analysis. In the
FEL analysis, 7, 1, 6, and 2 sites were found to be positively selected in NAs of viruses from North American
swine, Eurasian swine, seasonal human, and the pandemic 2009 clusters, respectively (Table 2). No site was
detected to be under positive selection for cluster 2.1,
which was mainly composed of isolates from birds.
Notably, positions 46, 53 and 453 were positively
selected for viruses from North American swine. These
positions are located in the T-cell antigenic regions,
while position 339 lie in the B-cell antigenic regions.
Positions 46 and 339 were associated with host

In this column, B indicates that the site lies in the B-cell antigenic regions [21]. G means that it is a potential glycosylation site. T indicates that the site lies in

adaptation after the virus was introduced from birds to
humans and position 46 is also a potential glycosylation
site [20]. Position 46 is also a potential glycosylation
site. Among the positively selected sites for strains from
the seasonal human cluster, positions 344 and 365 are
situated in both B-cell antigenic regions, and position
365 is also a glycosylation site [21]. Overall, the FEL
analysis shows that 2 of the 6 positively selected sites lie
in the B-cell antigenic regions for the seasonal human
lineage and 1 of the 2 positively selected lies in the Tcell antigenic region for the pandemic H1N1 lineage.
Positions 365 and 382 have been reported to be
involved with the host shift of the virus [20]. Two positions, 35 and 453, were positively selected for NAs of
the pandemic 2009 strains. Position 453 lies in the Tcell antigenic regions [19]. It should be noted that position 274 (numbering 275 in this study), which confers
drug resistance [7], was positively selected for seasonal
human H1N1 virus. At this position, 1336 sequences
(accounting for ~77% of all seasonal human H1N1
viruses) possessed histidine, while 398 sequences had
tyrosine. However, there was no evidence of positive
selection acting on this position of the pandemic H1N1
viruses, in which 1372 (~98%) sequences possessed histidine and only 24 sequences (less than 2%) had
tyrosine.
Analysis of differential selection

Differential selection was found to act on 16, 8 and 6
sites on HA1, HA2 and NA, respectively, between seasonal human H1N1 and the pandemic 2009 human strains
(Table 3). These differentially selected sites might have
significant biological functions. For HA1, HA2 and NA,
10 out of 16, 4 out of 8 and 1 out 6 differentially
selected sites lie in T-cell and/or B-cell antigenic
regions. For example, positions 34, 86, 94, 153, 160, 187,
202, 224, 237 and 302 in HA1 are located within B-cell
antigenic regions. Moreover, positions 34, 153, 250 in

HA1, 430, 473, 527, 541 in HA2, and 52 in NA are
located within T-cell antigenic regions. In particular, differential selection has resulted in distinct amino acid
polymorphism at some positions, such as positions 86,
94, 153, 160, 202, 203, 234, 250, 302, 374, 399, 473 and
527 in HA, and positions 52 and 257 in NA (Table 3).
For example, at position 160 in HA, almost all the pandemic strains had K, with only a single exception,
whereas more than 95% (n = 1345) of the seasonal
H1N1 strains had N.
Between North American swine strains and the pandemic 2009 human strains, 25 sites in HA were differentially selected, with 16 in HA1 and 9 in HA2 (Table 4).
Among them, 19 sites lie in T-cell and/or B-cell antigenic regions. For example, positions 34, 48, 154, 189,
205, 207, 223, 263 and 306 in HA1 are located in the Bcell antigenic regions, while positions 31, 32, 34, 154 in
HA1 and 411, 427, 434, 458, 478, 479, 530, 547 are
located in the T-cell antigenic regions. In particular,
position 223 is among the key sites able to affect receptor-binding ability [11]. Different amino acid polymorphism has also been seen at a few positions, such as
203, 205, 207 and 374 (Table 4).
In addition, between the Eurasian swine isolates and
the pandemic 2009 isolates NA, there were five sites
under distinctive selection, with three lying in the T-cell
antigenic regions (Table 5). Among them, 321, 453 and
454 are within the T-cell antigenic regions [19].
Although differential selection between the two lineages
has not led to distinct amino acid polymorphism, the
pandemic 2009 strains did display a greater degree of
amino acid polymorphism at positions 35, 381, 452 and
453 (Table 5).

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the positive selection
pressures acting on HA and NA proteins of H1N1 influenza viruses. Despite the fact that the global ω for each

cluster was below 1, a site-by-site analysis showed that
some amino acid positions were under positive selection.
Our results suggest that the pandemic 2009 human isolates have been subject to the strongest positive selection.
Positive selection on HAs and NAs of isolates from
humans was stronger than that on the swine strains. The
avian strains were subject to the weakest selection, with
no site found to be positively selected in avian isolates for
either HA or NA. This indicates differing degrees of selection pressures acting on viruses from different hosts.
Although the HA2 domain also has important biological functions [5], a site-by-site positive-selection analysis
of this domain has seldom been mentioned in previous
studies [10,13]. We found some positively selected sites
in the HA2 domain and this is consistent with a

previous report [13]. Some of them are located in T-cell
antigenic regions, such as 411, 451, 460 and 530 (Table
1). Therefore, positive selection on the HA2 domain
might be responsible for the antigenic variation of the
viruses. In particular, position 399, which was reported
to be associated with host adaptation of the virus, has
also been detected to be under positive selection [20].
However, for the amino acids in the HA2 subunit previously reported to be associated with host adaptation,
we found no evidence of positive selection among the
human H1N1 influenza viruses [20]. Therefore, based
on current evidence, a major contribution of the HA2
domain to the survival of the pandemic 2009 strains
might involve the antigenic variation resulting from
positive selection.

Similar to the findings of Furuse et al. [13], our results
reveal that the pandemic 2009 human strains were subject to different selection pressures compared to seasonal human strains. Twenty-four HA sites and six NA
sites were differentially selected. Most of these sites lie
in the B-cell and/or T-cell antigenic regions. However,
both the SLAC and FEL methods showed that 222 and
451 were positively selected for human strains. Position
222 is situated within B-cell antigenic regions and is
also associated with receptor binding. Position 451 is
located within the T-cell antigenic regions of HA2.
However, selection at these two positions was not
detected in the previous studies [11,13]. This might be
explained by the larger sample size in the present study.

That many positively selected sites are located in the Tcell and/or B-cell antigenic regions might indicate that
positive selection from the hosts, perhaps caused by vaccination and mass use of anti-viral drugs, might lead to
corresponding variations in the T-cell and/or B-cell
antigenic regions of the viruses. Accordingly, this would
reduce the efficacy of vaccines and increase viral fitness.
Many amino acids have been reported to be associated
with the host shifts of the viruses from birds to humans
[20]. Although both the seasonal human H1N1 and the
pandemic 2009 viruses did not come directly from avian
hosts, some positively selected positions that have also
been previously reported to facilitate the inter-host
transmission of the virus showed distinct amino acid
polymorphism (Table 3). Although most of the viruses
of these two lineages had D187, the amino acid polymorphism was more diverse for the seasonal H1N1 lineage, with at least seven different amino acids appearing
at this position. At position 399 in HA2, the seasonal
strains showed greater amino acid variation, with 1383
sequences possessing K, whereas the majority of the
pandemic strains had H. In particular, the avian viruses
had E187 and N399, whereas viruses from pigs had
D187 and H399. Therefore, the E to D mutation at position 187 and N to H mutation at position 399 might
have facilitated the inter-transmission of the virus from
birds to pigs and also helped the virus to adapt to
humans.
Previous work has also shown that sites 138, 186, 190,
194, 225, 226 and 228 in HA1 are key positions concerning the receptor-binding property [11]. Our results
revealed that 190 and 225 (numbering 187 and 222 in
this study) were positively selected for seasonal human
H1N1 and the pandemic 2009 H1N1, respectively. In
addition, position 226 (numbering 223 in this study)
was differentially selected between the pandemic 2009
H1N1 and the North American swine H1N1. Positive
and/or differential selection has caused significant

Li et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:183
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/183

amino acid polymorphism at these positions and this
might favour the inter-host transmission of the viruses
from pigs to humans.
Differential-selection analysis also supported the pandemic 2009 strains being subject to distinctive selection
compared to their progenitors. Specifically, different
selection pressures have acted on HA proteins of the
pandemic 2009 human and North American swine
strains. Many of these differentially selected sites are
located in the T-cell and/or B-cell antigenic regions.
Similarly, selection pressures on NA proteins of the pandemic 2009 human viruses differed from those on the
Eurasian swine strains and some positions are located in
T-cell antigenic regions. Different selection pressures
have caused amino acid variations at these positions.
These might account for the antigenic variation of the
pandemic 2009 human viruses with those from pigs.
The N-linked glycosylation is noteworthy because of
its ability to influence virus survival and virulence [22].
Robertson et al. [23] suggest that mutation at site 160,
resulting in the loss of a glycosylation site, could cause
the antigenic drift. This site has also been considered to
be the candidate amino acid for loss of the ability to
agglutinate chicken erythrocytes [24]. Our results
revealed that some glycosylation sites were under positive selection, such as positions 160 and 162 in HA, or
differential selection, such as position 52 in NA. Considering that HA sites 160, 162 also lie in the B-cell antigenic region, positive selection at these two sites might
play a greater role in viral adaptation. Site 52 in NA is
also noteworthy. In the seasonal human strains, less
than 10% of isolates had S52. However, all of the pandemic 2009 human strains possessed S52. Therefore,
this potential glycosylation site might also contribute to
the prevalence of the pandemic 2009 strains.
It has been reported that mutations at some NA sites
are associated with drug resistance of the strains. For
example, H274Y and N294S confer resistance to oseltamivir [7]. Janies et al. [14] reported that positive selection on position 274 was responsible for the wide
spread of the drug-resistant strains of both seasonal and
pandemic H1N1 lineages. Herein, we found evidence of
positive selection acting on position 274 (numbering
275 in this study), suggesting that positive selection did
play a significant role in the emergence and prevalence
of the drug-resistant variants of seasonal human H1N1
lineage [14]. However, there was limited amino acid
polymorphism at position 274 and more than 98% (n =
1372) of the pandemic H1N1 strains possessed H at this
position. Neither the SLAC nor FEL analysis found position 274 to be under positive selection (Table 2). Therefore, positive selection might not be responsible for the
spread of the oseltamivir-resistance of the pandemic
strains.

Page 7 of 9

Compared to the findings of Janies et al. [14], our
results revealed a greater number of sites of NA proteins
to be under positive selection. Both the SLAC and FEL
analyses produced evidence of positive selection at positions 84, 151 and 382. In particular, mutation at position 382 has been reported to be involved in facilitating
host shift of the virus. Together with the fact that some
positively selected sites of NA proteins are situated in
B-cell antigenic regions, and associated with drug resistance, it is possible that positive selection on NA proteins has had a profound effect on the seasonal human
H1N1 viruses.
As shown in our analysis and in other previous
reports, there is no distinct lineage displacement for the
pandemic 2009 cluster in the HA and NA trees (Figures
S1 and S2). This does not agree with the hypothesis that
stronger positive selection usually leads to lineage displacement. This phenomenon may be explained by the
low global ω value for the pandemic 2009 cluster (0.34
for HA and 0.27 for NA), although it is the highest
among the values for all five clusters (Figures 1 and 2).
This indicates that although some amino acid positions
are subject to positive selection, most of the positions
are evolving neutrally or are under negative selection.

Conclusions
Our analysis shows that the HA2 domain and NA have
been under positive selection. Although we only found
indications of weak positive selection acting on the whole
HA and NA proteins, the pandemic 2009 strains were
subject to the strongest selection, differing from those on
the seasonal human H1N1 viruses, North American
swine viruses and Eurasian swine viruses. Most of the
positively selected sites were located in the antigenic
regions or were sites with known functional importance.
This might account for the altered pathogenic profile of
the pandemic 2009 strains and might have helped them
to better adapt to the new hosts. In addition, our findings
suggest that selection pressure on position 274 of NA
protein, a site associated with drug resistance, might be
responsible for the prevalence of the drug-resistant variants of the seasonal human H1N1 lineage.
Methods
Datasets

All HA and NA gene sequences of H1N1 influenza A
virus for this analysis were retrieved from the NCBI
Influenza Virus Resource (using H1 and N1 subtype as
search queries) [25]. Two datasets were compiled: Dataset1) all HA genes from human, swine, and avian
strains; Dataset2) all NA genes from human, swine, and
avian strains. Redundant sequences were removed.
Each dataset was aligned under the open reading
frame using the HyPhy 2.0 software package [26]. We

Li et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:183
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/183

then constructed a maximum-likelihood tree using
RAxML for each dataset, assuming the GAMMACAT
substitution model and setting the 1918 human
sequence as the outgroup [27]. A rapid bootstrapping
analysis was conducted using 1000 replicates, with other
parameters set to the default values. Based on the resulting maximum-likelihood tree, we further divided Dataset1 and Dataset2 into ten subsets (Tables 1 and 2): 1.1)
all HA genes from avian strains; 1.2) all HA genes from
North American swine strains; 1.3) all HA genes from
Eurasian swine strains; 1.4) all HA genes from seasonal
human strains; 1.5) all HA genes from pandemic 2009
strains; 2.1) all NA genes from avian strains; 2.2) all NA
genes from North American swine strains; 2.3) all NA
genes from Eurasian swine strains; 2.4) all NA genes
from seasonal human strains; 2.5) all NA genes from
pandemic 2009 human strains.
Analysis of positive selection

Global ω was calculated for each cluster using HyPhy.
Maximum-likelihood trees obtained from the previous
step were set as input trees. The MG94REV3x4 substitution model was applied, using equal equilibrium frequencies. The single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC)
method is appropriate for large alignments but might
underestimate the number of positively selected sites,
whereas the fixed-effects likelihood (FEL) method takes
rate variation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rate
into account and can be efficiently parallelized [28]. For
the sake of comparison, we chose to use both of these
methods [26,28]. Maximum-likelihood trees estimated by
RAxML in the previous step were set as the input trees.
The HKY85 model was selected as the best-fitting model
of sequence evolution. A global ω value was estimated
using a codon model obtained by combining the MG94
and HKY85 models. A two-rate FEL model was applied,
allowing dN and dS to be adjusted across sites. P-values of
<0.05 were considered to be significant.
Analysis of differential selection

A comparative selection test was applied for datasets 1.4
and 1.5, and datasets 2.4 and 2.5, to detect codons
under differential selection between seasonal human
H1N1 and the pandemic 2009 strains. The same analysis
was also done between the pandemic 2009 human
strains and those from North American swine for HA,
and between the pandemic 2009 human strains and
those from Eurasian swine for NA. This was performed
in HyPhy by using the standard analysis procedure “CompareSelectivePressure.bf”. All settings for the comparative selection analysis were the same as those in the
previous selection analysis. P-values of <0.01 were considered to be significant.
