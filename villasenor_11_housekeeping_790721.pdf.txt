Abstract
Background: A traditional concept in bacterial genetics states that housekeeping genes, those involved in basic
metabolic functions needed for maintenance of the cell, are encoded in the chromosome, whereas genes required for
dealing with challenging environmental conditions are located in plasmids. Exceptions to this rule have emerged from
genomic sequence data of bacteria with multipartite genomes. The genome sequence of R. etli CFN42 predicts the
presence of panC and panB genes clustered together on the 642 kb plasmid p42f and a second copy of panB on
plasmid p42e. They encode putative pantothenate biosynthesis enzymes (pantoate-b-alanine ligase and 3-methyl-2oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase, respectively). Due to their ubiquitous distribution and relevance in the central
metabolism of the cell, these genes are considered part of the core genome; thus, their occurrence in a plasmid is
noteworthy. In this study we investigate the contribution of these genes to pantothenate biosynthesis, examine
whether their presence in plasmids is a prevalent characteristic of the Rhizobiales with multipartite genomes, and assess
the possibility that the panCB genes may have reached plasmids by horizontal gene transfer.
Results: Analysis of mutants confirmed that the panC and panB genes located on plasmid p42f are indispensable
for the synthesis of pantothenate. A screening of the location of panCB genes among members of the Rhizobiales
showed that only R. etli and R. leguminosarum strains carry panCB genes in plasmids. The panCB phylogeny
attested a common origin for chromosomal and plasmid-borne panCB sequences, suggesting that the R. etli and R.
leguminosarum panCB genes are orthologs rather than xenologs. The panCB genes could not totally restore the
ability of a strain cured of plasmid p42f to grow in minimal medium.
Conclusions: This study shows experimental evidence that core panCB genes located in plasmids of R. etli and R.
leguminosarum are indispensable for the synthesis of pantothenate. The unusual presence of panCB genes in
plasmids of Rhizobiales may be due to an intragenomic transfer from chromosome to plasmid. Plasmid p42f
encodes other functions required for growth in minimal medium. Our results support the hypothesis of
cooperation among different replicons for basic cellular functions in multipartite rhizobia genomes.

Background
Multipartite genomes are common among members of the
a-proteobacteria [1]. Most symbiotic nitrogen-fixing
bacteria belonging to the genera Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium possess multipartite genomes organized as a single circular chromosome
and a variable number of large plasmids [2]. In some species plasmids can represent, in terms of size, up to 40% of

the total genome. In Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium species
one plasmid (pSym) concentrates most of the genes
required for nodulation and nitrogen fixation [3]. The
complete genome sequences of different rhizobia have
revealed that plasmids harbor mainly accessory genes and
that most encode predicted transport systems and a variety
of catabolic pathways that may contribute to the adaptation
of rhizobia to the heterogeneous soil and nodule environments [2,4]. These genes are absent from closely related
genomes, lack synteny and their G+C composition differs
from that of the core genes. The core genes are mainly

located on chromosomes, have essential functions in cell
maintenance and have orthologs in related species [5,6].
In spite of this evidently biased distribution of core genes
in the chromosome and accessory genes in plasmids, it is
important to highlight the fact that there are interesting
exceptions to this genomic rule: several typical core genes
have been found encoded on rhizobia plasmids. Some are
copies of genes located on chromosomes, with redundant
functions that are totally dispensable for normal growth.
Examples of these genes are the multiple copies of chaperonin-encoding genes groEL/groES [7,8], two tpiA genes
encoding putative triose phosphate isomerase, a key
enzyme of central carbon metabolism [4,6,9], and two
putative S. meliloti asparagine synthetases (asnB and
asnO), which may have a role in asparagine synthesis from
aspartate by ATP-dependent amidation [10]. In contrast to
these reiterated genes, a few single copy core genes have
also been localized in plasmids. The tRNA specific for the
second most frequently used arginine codon, CCG, is
located on pSymB in S. melioti [10]. Since this gene lies
within a region of pSymB that could not be deleted [11], it
is assumed to be essential for cell viability. The single copy
of the minCDE genes, conceivably involved in proper cell
division, have also been found in plasmids of S. meliloti,
R. leguminosarum and R. etli [4,6,10]. Studies in S. meliloti
have demonstrated that even though these genes are
expressed in free-living cells and within nodules they are
nonessential for cell division, since their deletion did not
produce the small chromosomeless minicells observed in
E. coli and Bacillu subtilis [12].
A recent bioinformatic study revealed that approximately ten percent of the 897 complete bacterial genomes
available in 2009 carry some core genes on extrachromosomal replicons [13]. However, very few of these genes
have been functionally characterized and so their real contribution to bacterial metabolism is still an open question.
The complete genome sequence of R. etli CFN42 predicts that two putative “housekeeping” genes, panC and
panB, which may be involved in pantothenate biosynthesis, are clustered together on plasmid p42f. Pantothenate is an essential precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), a
key molecule in many metabolic reactions including the
synthesis of phospholipids, synthesis and degradation of
fatty acids, and the operation of the tricarboxylic acid
cycle [14]. The R. etli panC gene is predicted to encode
the sole pantoate-b-alanine ligase (PBAL), also known
as pantothenate synthetase (PS) (EC 6.3.2.1), present in
the R. etli genome. The function of this enzyme is
the ATP-dependent condensation of D-pantoate with balanine to form pantothenate, the last step of the pantothenate biosynthesis pathway. The panB gene encodes
the putative 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase (MOHMT) (EC 2.1.2.11), also known as
ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase (KPHMT), the

Page 2 of 11

first enzyme of the pathway, responsible for the formation of a-ketopantoate by the transfer of a methyl
group from 5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate to alphaketoisovalerate. The complete genome sequence of
R. etli CFN42 predicts that a second putative MOHMT
enzyme (RHE_PE00443), similar to the product of
panB, is encoded on plasmid p42e.
In this work we describe the isolation and use of panC
and panB mutants to analyze the involvement of these
plasmid-encoded genes in pantothenate biosynthesis.
A survey of the localization of panCB genes among
members of the Rhizobiales with multipartite genomes
allowed us to infer a panCB phylogeny and to establish
the probable chromosomal origin of these plasmidborne genes. We also report that the panCB genes
could not totally restore the growth in minimal medium
(MM) of a strain cured of plasmid p42f, suggesting that
other functions essential for growth in MM are encoded
in this plasmid.

Results
Functional characterization of plasmid p42f encoded
panCB genes

The predicted function of the product of panC
(RHE_PF00001) annotated as PBAL, is the catalysis of the
last step of pantothenate synthesis. This PBAL (298 amino
acids) showed 43% identity and 62% similarity over 279
amino acids with the functionally characterized PBAL of
E. coli K12 (284 amino acids). A search for conserved
domains (CD-search) at NCBI-CDD revealed the presence
of a typical pantoate-binding site. The panB gene
(RHE_PF00002) is located immediately downstream of
panC. The four nucleotide overlap between the panC
TGA codon and panB ATG codon suggest that these
genes might be transcribed as an operon. The panB gene
encodes a putative MOHMT, the first enzyme of the pantothenate pathway. A BlastP comparison between the
functionally characterized MOHMT of E. coli K12
(264 amino acids) and the putative MOHMT encoded on
plasmid p42f of R. etli CFN42 (273 amino acids) showed
37% identity and 56% similarity over a length of 240
amino acids. A CD-search indicated that in the putative
MOHMT of R. etli CFN42 the magnesium binding and
active site domains are conserved. Additionally, Paralog
Search (KEGG SSDB) and pathway tools predicted a second probable MOHMT, encoded on plasmid p42e (locus
tag RHE_PE00443). Both proteins are similar in length
(273 and 270 aa for the products encoded by panB and
RHE_PE00443, respectively). However, a BlastP comparison of these sequences showed only 36% identity and 56%
similarity over a tract of 140 amino acids. A CD-search
revealed that only 5 of 12 of the invariable residues present
in the active site domain are conserved in RHE_PE00443.
The metal binding domain could not be detected by the

CD-search. To determine whether the panC and panB
genes located on plasmid p42f are required for pantothenate synthesis, mutations in these genes were generated by
site-directed vector integration mutagenesis via a single
cross-over recombination (see details in Material and
Methods and Table 1). Mutants ReTV1 (panC - ) and
ReTV2 (panB-) were unable to grow in minimal medium
(MM) lacking calcium pantothenate (Figure 1a). Supplementation of MM with 1 μM calcium pantothenate
allowed the panC and panB mutants to recover their wildtype growth rate (Figure 1b). The pantothenate auxotrophy displayed by the panB mutant ReTV2 allowed us to

discard a functional role of the putative MOHMT encoded
by RHE_PE00443 in pantothenate biosynthesis. Moreover,
a pBBRMCS3 clone constitutively expressing
RHE_PE00443 (pTV7) was unable to complement the
pantothenate auxotrophy of the panB mutant (data not
shown).
Plasmid pTV4, harboring the panC and panB genes,
as well as plasmids pTV5 and pTV6, carrying only panC
or panB respectively, were introduced into mutant
strains ReTV1 and ReTV2 and the growth phenotype of
each construction was evaluated in MM. The panC
mutant ReTV1 complemented with the panCB genes

ReTV1-5) no growth occurred in the absence of pantothenate. These results strongly suggest that the panCB
genes form a single transcriptional unit. As expected,
wild type growth of panB mutant ReTV2 was recovered

plasmids. In contrast, in other species of Rhizobiales
with multipartite genomes, the panCB genes are always
confined to the chromosome, or to chromosome I in
those species harboring two chromosomes, with exception of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 which carries
panCB on the linear chromosome II and Methylobacterium nodulans ORS2060 that carries panC on their single chromosome and panB on plasmid pMNOD02
(Table 2).

The occurrence of panCB genes in plasmids is highly
conserved among R. etli and R. leguminosarum strains but
not in other members of the Rhizobiales with multipartite
genomes

Phylogenetic analysis of rhizobial panCB genes indicates
a common origin of chromosomal and plasmid-borne
sequences

To investigate whether the presence of the panCB genes
in plasmids is a common characteristic of the Rhizobiales, we examined the location of panCB genes in 22
members of the Rhizobiales having fully sequenced multipartite genomes (Table 2). To date, the genomes of
seven R. etli strains, in addition to CFN42, have been
totally sequenced [15]. However, with the exception of
strain CIAT 652, the genomes were released as draft
assemblies, precluding panCB localization. We experimentally determined the localization of panCB genes in
the genome of four of these R. etli strains (CIAT 894,
Kim5, 8C-3, and IE4771) by hybridization of their plasmid profiles with [ 32P]dCTP-labelled panC and panB
genes from CFN42 under high stringency conditions.
Both probes produced intense hybridization signals on
the same plasmid of each strain, indicating that the
panCB genes are also plasmid-borne in these R. etli
strains (Table 2). Coincidentally, in the three R. leguminosarum strains with fully sequenced genomes reported
in the NCBI database, the panCB genes are assigned to

Two possible hypotheses were considered to explain the
presence of panCB genes in plasmids of R. etli and
R. leguminosarum strains: (1) an intragenomic rearrangement of panCB genes from chromosome to plasmid,
which must have occurred in the last common ancestor
of both species; (2) by xenologous gene displacement,
that is, a horizontal transfer event in which a gene is
displaced by a horizontally transferred ortholog acquired
from another lineage [16]. In the latter hypothesis we
assume that the presence of these xenolog genes in plasmids conferred a selective advantage that may have
eventually led to the loss of the chromosome-located
panCB genes. To test these hypotheses the phylogeny of
16 rhizobial species inferred from ten orthologous single
copy housekeeping genes (fusA, guaA, ileS, infB, recA,
rplB, rpoB, rpoC, secY and valS) located on primary
chromosomes, was compared with the phylogeny of the
same rhizobial species inferred from the panCB genes
located on plasmids and chromosomes. The rationale
for this comparison was that if the plasmid-borne

panCB phylogeny agrees with the current phylogeny of
the Rhizobiales, inferred from the housekeeping genes, it
would support the hypothesis of intragenomic transfer
of the panCB genes. On the other hand, if both phylogenies are incongruent, it would favor the hypothesis of
horizontal transfer of the panCB genes. Concatenated
nucleic acids multiple alignments were used to infer
both phylogenies with the maximum likelihood method
described in materials and methods. The resulting phylogenetic trees are shown in Figure 2. The housekeeping
genes inferred tree (Figure 2a) was consistent with the
recently reported phylogeny of 19 Rhizobiales performed on a data set of 507 homologous proteins from
the primary chromosome [17]. Both trees are in close
agreement with the phylogeny inferred from the panCB
genes (Figure 2b). Thus the phylogeny of R. etli and
R. leguminosarum inferred from plasmid-encoded
panCB genes is consistent with the phylogeny deduced

from their housekeeping genes supporting the hypothesis of a chromosomal origin for the plasmid-encoded
panCB genes.
The panCB genes do not fully complement the growth
deficiency of a R. etli CFN42 p42f cured derivative in MM

It was reported previously that R. etli CFNX186, a p42fcured derivative of R. etli CFN42, is unable to grow in
MM [18]. To assess if the growth deficiency of strain
CFNX186 in MM was due to the absence of the panC
and panB genes, plasmid pTV4 (panCB) was introduced
into strain CFNX186. The growth of the transconjugant
(CFNX186-4) after 15 hours of culture in MM was only
50% that of the WT strain grown under the same conditions (Figure 3a). The growth of CFNX186-4 did not
improve even after 72 h in culture (data not shown).
Interestingly, strain CFNX186-4 had the same growth
rate as strain CFNX186 cultured in MM supplemented

shows that the growth deficiency of CFNX186 is only
partly due to the absence of the panCB genes and indicates that other functions encoded in plasmid p42f are
required for growth in MM.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the katG
gene, which encodes the sole catalase-peroxidase
expressed in free-living growth conditions, is located on
plasmid p42f of R. etli CFN42. These studies also
revealed that the growth rate of a katG mutant in MM
was significantly reduced in comparison with that of the
wild-type parental strain [19]. On plasmid p42f katG, as
well as its putative transcriptional regulator protein

encoded by oxyR, are located 80 bp downstream of the
panCB genes. We speculated that introduction of the
panCB genes together with the katG and oxyR genes
might improve the growth of CFNX186 in MM. To test
this hypothesis, we used pCos24, which contains a 20 kb
fragment of p42f carrying panCB, katG and oxyR (see
Material and Methods). pCos24 was introduced into
CFNX186 and the resulting transconjugant (CFNX18624) grown in MM. Figure 3 shows that after 15 hours of
culture there was no significant difference between the
growth rate of CFNX186 complemented only with
panCB (CFNX183-4), and CFNX186 complemented
with cosmid pCos24 (CFNX186-24). Furthermore, the

Figure 3 panCB genes do not fully restore the growth deficiency of CFNX186. Growth of R. etli CFN42 wild-type strain, its p42f-cured
derivative CFNX186, CFNX186 complemented with the panCB genes (CFNX186-4) and CFNX186 complemented with a 20 kb EcoRI fragment of
plasmid p42f containing the panC, panB, oxyR and katG genes (CFNX186-24) in: (a) minimal medium, (b) minimal medium supplemented with 1
μM pantothenate. Growth curves are the mean of at least three independent experiments; error bars represent standard deviations.

growth of CFNX186-24 did not increase even after 72 h
of culture (data not shown) indicating that katG
and oxyR did not improve the growth rate of panCB
complemented CFNX186 in MM. We also tested the
possibility that arginine might improve the growth of
strain CFNX186-24 due to the presence of a putative
N-acetylornithinase (EC 3.5.1.16) encoded in the plasmid p42f. In the Enterobactericeae this enzyme catalyzes
the conversion of N-acetylornithine to ornithine, a key
step in the arginine biosynthesis pathway [20]. However,
the growth deficiency of strain CFN186-24 in MM was
not corrected by the addition of 1, 5, 10 or 15 mM arginine (data not shown). Furthemore, we constructed an
argE mutant strain (ReTV3, Table 1) that was able to
grow in MM without exogenous arginine at the same
rate as parental strain CFN42 (data not shown), confirming that this gene is not essential for arginine
synthesis.

Discussion
Seminal studies on the phenotypic characterisation of plasmid-cured strains of R. leguminosarum and R. etli revealed
that the absence of several plasmids cause a growth deficiency in rich and minimal medium [18,21]. These findings suggested that undefined metabolic traits are present
on rhizobial plasmids. The bioinformatic analysis of 897
bacterial genomes performed by Harrison et al [13]
revealed the presence of extrachromosomal core genes in
82 genomes mainly belonging to the Proteobacteria. In
contrast with these in silico data, there is little experimental information on the contribution of these core genes to
bacterial metabolism or cellular process. The few genes
that have been functionally characterized encode redundant functions and are totally dispensable for the cell
[7-9,12]. Our study provides experimental evidence that
the enzymes MOHMT (EC 2.1.2.11) and PBAL (EC
6.3.2.1) encoded on plasmid p42f are indispensable for the
synthesis of pantothenate. Moreover, our results showed
that the cluster of panCB, katG and oxyR genes was insufficient to restore full growth capacity to the p42f cured
derivative CFNX186, implying that in addition to pantothenate synthesis, there are more functions encoded on
plasmid p42f required for growth in MM. Obvious candidates for these functions could not be identified a priori
among the 567 proteins encoded in p42f even though
their predicted functions were recently updated with
KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server and Pathway
Reconstruction Server). We discarded arginine limitation
as the cause for the growth deficiency of strain CFNX18624. The arginine prototrophy displayed by a mutation in
the p42f encoded argE suggests that in R. etli the conversion of N-acetylornithine to ornithine is catalyzed by the
chromosome-encoded ArgJ, an ornithine acetyltransferase
(OATase, EC 2.3.1.35), which transfers the acetyl group of

Page 7 of 11

N-acetylornithine to glutamate to produce ornithine and
N-acetylglutamate. Functional OATases have been found
in the majority of bacteria [20].
Also, we have demonstrated that plasmid-localization
of panCB in R. etli CFN42 is not unique to this strain.
A screening of the location of panCB genes among members of the Rhizobiales, showed that the occurrence of
these genes in plasmids is a highly conserved trait among
R. etli and R. leguminosarum strains. Furthermore, the
synteny of the panCB, oxyR, katG genes in R. etli CFN42
is conserved in R. etli CIAT652 and in R. leguminosarum
strains 3841, WSM1325 and WSM2304. In contrast, genomes of Rhizobium sp., Sinorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium
and Mesorhizobium species carried chromosomal panCB
genes. Only in A. tumefaciens C58 the panCB genes are
localized in the linear chromosome, whereas in all other
Rhizobiales harboring secondary chromosomes the
panCB genes were located in chromosome I. A bioinformatic analysis with MicrobesOnline operon predictions
[22] indicates that panCB genes are organized as possible
operons in most of the Rhizobiales examined in this
work: all these predicted operons conserve the four
nucleotide overlap between the panC TGA codon and
the panB ATG codon observed in R. etli CFN42 (data
not shown). In the genomes of Bradyrhizobium sp.
BTAi1, Nitrobacter hamburgensis X14, Methylobacterium
extorquens AM1, Methylobacterium radiotolerans
JCM2831 and Xantobacter autotrophicus Ry2, panC and
panB are encoded in separate chromosomal loci, whereas
in Methylobacterium nodulans ORS2060 panC is located
in the chromosome and panB in plasmid pMNOD02.
The Rhizobiales phylogeny inferred from concatenated
panC and panB genes was consistent with the phylogeny
deduced from 10 concatenated housekeeping genes. The
low bootstrap values obtained for some nodes of the
panCB phylogeny might be due to the small number of
informative characters in the alignments of only two
genes (1 977 nucleotides). This is consistent with previous reports that state that trees from longer alignments
obtained by the concatenation of genes encoding multiple-protein families have higher bootstrap support than
trees inferred from genes encoding single proteins [23].
The phylogenetic relationships among Rhizobium species
carrying panCB genes in plasmids with their closest relatives, Agrobacterium and Sinorhizobium species, harboring panCB genes in the chromosome was also observed
in neighbor-joining trees inferred from single panC and
panB genes (data not shown). These data agree with the
hypothesis that plasmid-encoded panCB genes are orthologs of the panCB genes located in chromosome. From
these results, we propose that the presence of the panCB
genes in plasmids in R. etli and R. leguminosarum species
may be due to an intragenomic transfer event from chromosome to plasmid. The mechanism leading to the

Villaseñor et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:66
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/66

transfer of core genes from chromosome to plasmids
could involve cointegration and excision events between
the replicons, similar to rearrangements that have been
visualized in S. meliloti [24]. The translocation of genes
from chromosome to plasmids may be part of the complex evolution of multipartite genomes. A study based on
the analysis of clusters of syntenic genes shared among
plasmids and secondary chromosomes of bacteria with
multipartite genomes suggested that secondary chromosomes may have originated from an ancestral plasmid to
which genes had been transferred from a primary chromosome [17].
Our pioneering work on plasmid-encoded functions in
R. etli CFN42 established that a functional relationship
among different replicons is required for symbiotic and
free-living functions [18,25]. More recently, a functional
connectivity among most of the proteins encoded in the
replicons of R. etli CFN42 was predicted in silico [6].
Our results demonstrated that the putative MOHMT
encoded by RHE_PE00443 is not functional under the
conditions studied and provides evidence of functional
cooperation between p42f and chromosomally encoded
proteins for pantothenate biosynthesis.

Conclusions
Our study shows that the presence of the core panCB
genes in a plasmid is a characteristic conserved in R. etli
and R. leguminosarum strains but not in other Rhizobiales. The phylogenetic approach used in this study
suggests that the unusual presence of panCB in plasmids may be due to an intragenomic transfer event
from chromosome to plasmid rather than a xenologous
gene displacement. Using R. etli CFN42 as a model, we
showed that the plasmid-encoded core panCB genes
were indispensable for the synthesis of pantothenate.
The panCB genes could not totally restore growth of a
strain cured of plasmid p42f in minimal medium, suggesting that other functions essential for growth in this
medium are encoded in this plasmid. Our results support the hypothesis of functional cooperation among different replicons for basic cellular functions in
multipartite rhizobial genomes.
Methods
Bacterial strains, media and growth conditions

The bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in
Table 1. Rhizobium strains were grown at 30°C in three
different media: a) PY rich medium [26], b) Minimal
medium (MM) [27] and c) Minimal medium plus 1 μM
calcium pantothenate (MMP). MM was prepared as follows: a solution containing 10 mM succinate as carbon
source, 10 mM NH 4 Cl as nitrogen source, 1.26 mM
K2HPO4, 0.83 mM MgSO4, was adjusted to pH 6.8 and
sterilized. After sterilization the following components

Page 8 of 11

were added to the final concentration indicated: 0.0184
mM FeCl3 6H2O (filter sterilized), 1.49 mM CaCl2 2H2O
(autoclaved separately), 10 μg ml-1 biotin and 10 μg ml-1
thiamine (both filter sterilized). MMP contains the same
components plus 1 μM calcium pantothenate. To determine growth rates on MM or MMP, Rhizobium strains
were grown to saturation in PY medium, the cells were
harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with sterile
deionized water and diluted to an initial optical density
of 0.05 at 600 nm (OD600) when added to 30 ml of MM.
These cultures were grown for 24 h in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks to deplete any endogenous pantothenate.
Cells were then harvested and washed as described above
and added to fresh MM or MMP in the same manner as
for the first inoculation and cultured for 15 hours. Bacterial growth was quantified by measuring optical density
at 600 nm (OD600) every 3 hours. Antibiotics were used
at the following concentrations (in μg ml-1): chloramphenicol (Cm), 30; tetracycline (Tc), 10; kanamycin (Km), 30;
gentamicin (Gm), 30; spectinomycin (Sp), 100; nalidixic
acid (Nal), 20. E. coli transformants harboring recombinant plasmids (b-galactosidase-positive) were identified
by growth on LB plates with 30 μg ml -1 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactoside (X-Gal).
DNA manipulations

Standard techniques described by Sambrook et al. [28]
were used for plasmid and total DNA isolation, restriction,
cloning, transformations, and agarose gel electrophoresis.
Plasmid mobilization from E. coli to Rhizobium was done
by conjugation performed on PY plates at 30°C by using
overnight cultures grown to stationary phase. Donors
(E. coli strain S17-1) and recipients (R. etli CFN42 wild
type and mutant strains) were mixed at a 1:2 ratio, and
suitable markers were used for transconjugant selection.
Mutagenesis of the panC and panB genes and genetic
complementation of mutant strains

Mutants were generated by site-directed vector integration mutagenesis. Internal 400 bp DNA fragments of
panC and panB were amplified by PCR with primers A
and B; C and D, respectively (Table 3). PCR fragments of
panC and panB were cloned in vector pBC as 400 bp
BamHI-XbaI fragments, generating pBC1 and pBC2
respectively, and then subcloned as KpnI-XbaI fragments
into suicide vector pK18mob [29] to form plasmids pTV1
and pTV2, respectively. These plasmids were mobilized
into R. etli CFN42 by conjugation and single crossover
recombinants selected on PY plates containing Km and
Nal. The disruption of the panC and panB genes was
confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a 400-bp PCR
internal fragment of each gene as a probe (data not
shown). The resultant mutants were named ReTV1 and
ReTV2 respectively. To complement the phenotype of

as previously reported by [31], using Rapid-hyb buffer.
To use the panC and panB genes as probes, both genes
were amplified by PCR, separated on a 1% agarose and
purified by a PCR purification kit (QIAquick). They
were labeled with [a-32P]dCTP using a Rediprime DNA
labeling system. Plasmid profiles were visualized by the

in a similar manner.

All genomic sequences analyzed in this study were
obtained from the Integrated Microbial Genomes System
of the DOE Joint Genome Institute http://img.jgi.doe.
gov/). We obtained protein and gene sequences of panB,
panC and 10 chromosomal housekeeping genes (fusA,
guaA, ileS, infB, recA, rplB, rpoB, rpoC, secY and valS)
from 16 rhizobial species. Accession numbers for these
sequences and the species list are shown in Table S1 (see
Additional file 1). An orthologous data set for each gene
was constructed using Blast [32] and the bidirectional
best hit method applying the criteria reported by Poggio
et al [33]. Multiple alignments of putative orthologous
proteins were performed using the MUSCLE program
[34] with default settings. After removing poorly conserved regions two concatenated protein alignments were
obtained, one for the 10 chromosomal housekeeping
genes (8469 amino acids) and the other for panB and
panC (659 amino acids). Both concatenated protein multiple alignments were used to generate nucleic acids multiple alignments of their respective genes with the
Tranalign program of the EMBOSS suit http://emboss.
sourceforge.net/. Nucleic acids multiple alignments were
used to obtain two phylogenies with the maximum likelihood method implemented in PHYML [35] with HKY as
substitution model [36]. The phylogenetic reconstruction
was carried out with a nonparametric bootstrap analysis
of 100 replicates for each alignment. TreeDyn program
[37] was used to visualize and edit both phylogenies.

The restriction sites are indicated in bold.

the panC and panB mutants, plasmids pTV4, pTV5,
pTV6 and pTV7 were constructed as follows: a 3.1 kb
EcoRI fragment from cosmid vector pCos24, isolated
from a genomic library of R. etli CFN42 [30] and containing the panC and panB genes, was subcloned in broadhost-range vector pRK7813, generating plasmid pTV4.
To construct plasmid pTV5, a 1.2 kb fragment containing
only panC (894 bp) was amplified by PCR with primers E
and F and cloned in the KpnI-XbaI sites in the broadhost-range vector pBBRMSC3 so that the gene would be
constitutively expressed from the vector’s lacZ promoter.
Primers G and H (Table 3) were used to amplify a 1 kb
PCR fragment containing only the panB gene (822 bp).
This DNA fragment was cloned in plasmid pBBRMSC3
in the KpnI-XbaI restriction sites, generating plasmid
pTV6. Plasmid pTV7 contains the second panB gene
(RHE_PE00443), encoded on R. etli plasmid p42e, this
gene was amplified with primers I and J. The resultant
1 kb PCR fragment was cloned in the KpnI-XbaI sites of
plasmid pBBRMSC3. To complement the growth deficiency of strain CFNX186, a derivative of R. etli CFN42
cured of plasmid p42f, plasmid pTV4 and cosmid vector
pCos24 were introduced by conjugation. The complemented strains obtained were named CFNX186-4 and
CFNX186-24 respectively. The argE gene was disrupted
as described above. Briefly, an internal 400 bp PCR fragment of argE amplified with primers K and L was cloned
directly in pK18mob using the KpnI and XbaI sites to
give pTV3 (Table 1). This recombinant suicide plasmid
was mobilized into R. etli CFN42 and the resultant
mutant named ReTV3 (Table 1).
