Abstract
Background: Regulation of sulphur metabolism in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 has
been studied intensively in the last few years, due to its industrial as well as scientific importance.
Previously, the gene cg0156 was shown to belong to the regulon of McbR, a global transcriptional
repressor of sulphur metabolism in C. glutamicum. This gene encodes a putative ROK-type
regulator, a paralogue of the activator of sulphonate utilisation, SsuR. Therefore, it is an interesting
candidate for study to further the understanding of the regulation of sulphur metabolism in C.
glutamicum.
Results: Deletion of cg0156, now designated cysR, results in the inability of the mutant to utilise
sulphate and aliphatic sulphonates. DNA microarray hybridisations revealed 49 genes with
significantly increased and 48 with decreased transcript levels in presence of the native CysR
compared to a cysR deletion mutant. Among the genes positively controlled by CysR were the gene
cluster involved in sulphate reduction, fpr2 cysIXHDNYZ, and ssuR. Gel retardation experiments
demonstrated that binding of CysR to DNA depends in vitro on the presence of either O-acetyl-Lserine or O-acetyl-L-homoserine. Mapping of the transcription start points of five transcription
units helped to identify a 10 bp inverted repeat as the possible CysR binding site. Subsequent in vivo
tests proved this motif to be necessary for CysR-dependent transcriptional regulation.
Conclusion: CysR acts as the functional analogue of the unrelated LysR-type regulator CysB from
Escherichia coli, controlling sulphide production in response to acceptor availability. In both bacteria,
gene duplication events seem to have taken place which resulted in the evolution of dedicated
regulators for the control of sulphonate utilisation. The striking convergent evolution of network
topology indicates the strong selective pressure to control the metabolism of the essential but
often toxic sulphur-containing (bio-)molecules.

1 Background
Corynebacterium glutamicum, a gram-positive soil bacterium, is of great biotechnological interest due to its ability
to produce high yields of L-glutamate and L-lysine [1]. The
industrial interest as well as the emergence of C. glutamicum as a model organism for the order of the Actinomycetales in general and specifically the suborder
Corynebacterineae resulted in intensified research on the
metabolic capabilities of C. glutamicum. One focus of this
research has been the elucidation of the pathways
involved in the metabolism of sulphur-containing amino
acids (reviewed in [2]). This is in part due to the ability of
C. glutamicum to produce high yields of L-lysine, which
shares the precursor L-aspartic acid with L-methionine,
and L-serine [3,4], the precursor for L-cysteine biosynthesis. From the existence of these strains it can be concluded
that C. glutamicum has the capability to produce significant amounts of sulphur-containing amino acids, a
hypothesis that is backed at least for L-methionine by in
silico studies [5]. Yet, although almost all of the genes
involved in the various pathways have been identified in
the last few years [2], no production strain is available up
to now.
This might be at least in part due to a tight transcriptional
regulation of the genes involved in sulphur metabolism.
The regulation has therefore been studied intensively in
recent years, resulting in the identification of the global
transcriptional repressor McbR (methionine and cysteine
biosynthesis regulator) [6,7] which was shown to control
almost all genes known to be involved in the various pathways of sulphur interconversion. Activity of McbR was
shown to be negatively controlled by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) [7] which is derived from the methylation
agent S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). SAM is of great
importance during cell growth as it is needed, e.g., for the
modification of newly synthesised DNA [8], linking sulphur metabolism to the growth phase [7].
Still, studies from other model organisms like Escherichia
coli or Bacillus subtilis implicated the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions. For example, sulphur metabolism
in B. subtilis is controlled globally on the RNA level via the
S-box regulon in response to SAM availability [9], analogous to McbR control in C. glutamicum. In addition to this
global regulation, a number of regulatory proteins
involved in the control of sulphur metabolism have been
described recently for B. subtilis, e.g. CysL [10], Spx [11],
and CymR [12,13]. In C. glutamicum, targets for additional
regulation were delivered by the McbR regulon itself.
McbR controls two genes that are predicted to encode regulators of the ROK family [14]. One, now called SsuR (sulphonate sulphur utilisation regulator), was shown by
Koch et al. [15] to control a subset of McbR-regulated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/483

genes involved in the utilisation of aliphatic sulphonates
[16]. Thus, the other, encoded by cg0156, was likely to be
involved in transcriptional regulation of sulphur metabolism in C. glutamicum also.
Therefore, the gene cg0156 and its encoded protein were
analysed by means of growth assays of a defined deletion
mutant strain, transcriptional studies, and electrophoretic
mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to identify the regulon,
binding sites, and effectors of this predicted transcriptional regulator.

2 Results
2.1 The Corynebacterium glutamicum mutant CR030
with a deleted cg0156 (cysR) gene can no longer grow with
sulphate or sulphonates as sole source of sulphur
The transcriptional regulator McbR, discovered by Rey et
al. [6], was shown to act as the global repressor of sulphur
metabolism in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032
[7]. Besides a large number of genes encoding enzymes,
transporters, and unknown functions, the regulon of
McbR includes two genes coding for possible regulators,
cg0012 (ssuR) and cg0156. According to a bioinformatic
classification, both encoded proteins belong to the ROK
protein family [14], which is made up of sugar kinases,
transcriptional repressors for sugar catabolism operons,
and proteins of unknown function [17].

As a first step, a detailed bioinformatic analysis of the protein encoded by cg0156 was carried out. Cg0156 has a
length of 381 amino acids and a molecular mass of 40.1
kDa. According to a similarity search against the SUPERFAMILY database [18], Cg0156 contains a helix-turn-helix
(HTH) motif of the winged-helix type (amino acids 34–
65) and shows weak similarities to members of the ROK
protein family, a finding that is supported by a weak hit
against the PFAM database [19] as well as against the CDD
database [20]. Despite being somewhat similar to NagC
[21] and Mlc (originally discovered as DgsA [22]) from
Escherichia coli, the function of Cg0156 could not be
inferred based on sequence similarity alone. A phylogenetic tree build from proteins with at least 20% similarity
retrieved from THESEED [23] also revealed little information other than the existence of potential orthologues in
Corynebacterium efficiens and Corynebacterium diphtheriae,
while SsuR in C. glutamicum is most likely a paralogue
(data not shown). This relationship as well as being a part
of the McbR regulon indicated that Cg0156 might be a
transcriptional regulator, involved in the regulation of sulphur metabolism in C. glutamicum.
To obtain a hint on the function of Cg0156, a defined
deletion mutant (CR030) was constructed, almost completely removing the open reading frame. Like the assay
performed by Koch et al. [15] to characterise SsuR, the

growth of CR030 was then assayed in liquid MMES minimal medium containing different compounds as sole
source of sulphur, by name sulphate, ethanesulphonate,
and L-cysteine, and compared to the wild type strain
ATCC 13032 (Fig. 1). While the wild type strain grows
equally well with all three compounds tested, the mutant
strain CR030 can grow with neither sulphate nor
ethanesulphonate, while growth on L-cysteine is comparable to that of the wild type albeit with a slight increase in
duplication time and a slightly decreased final biomass. In
addition, neither sulphite nor any of the aliphatic sulphonates (as well as their esters) that can be utilised by the
wild type [16] can be used by the mutant (data not
shown). Based on the apparent requirement for cysteine,
Cg0156 was designated CysR (cysteine biosynthesis regulator). This raised the question of which genes are the target(s) of CysR-mediated transcriptional control. The most
likely candidates were the genes involved in the pathway
for assimilatory reduction of sulphate, fpr2 cysIXHDNYZ
(as proposed earlier by Rückert et al. [24]), the genes
needed for L-cysteine biosynthesis (cysKE), and the genes
involved in sulphonate(ester) utilisation (ssu and seu
[16]).

2.2 The regulator CysR affects a subset of genes of the
McbR regulon
The first step to determine the targets of CysR was a global
transcriptome study using the whole C. glutamicum
genome microarray developed by Hüser et al. [25]. Due to
the observation that the mutant CR030 looses the ability
to grow on sulphate and sulphonates, it was reasoned that
CysR might act as an activator of the genes involved.
Therefore, the mutant as well as the wild type strain were
grown in MMS minimal medium with limiting amounts
of L-cysteine (to allow for growth of CR030) as sole source
of sulphur and were then subjected to sulphur starvation
for 30 min to maximise transcription of the ssu, seu, and
cys genes (as observed by Koch et al. [16] and Rückert et al.
[24]). Isolation of total RNA and DNA microarray hybridisations were performed, revealing 82 genes with reduced
mRNA levels in the mutant and 20 genes with increased
mRNA levels (data not shown). As expected, all genes of
the fpr2 cysIXHDNYZ cluster as well as all ssu and seu
genes, including ssuR, were found among the genes with
strongly reduced transcription. These results indicated a
function as transcriptional activator for these genes but
raised the question whether CysR affects the transcription

of the ssu and seu genes directly or indirectly via transcriptional regulation by SsuR. Furthermore, an additional 16
genes of the McbR regulon were found less transcribed in
the mutant, e.g. cysK, cg3372, and cg2678-74.
To differentiate between direct effects of CysR and indirect
effects due to, e.g., regulation of McbR and SsuR, two new
mutants were constructed two minimise these indirect
effects: CR031 (mcbRΔHTH ssuRΔHTH cysRconst), a mutant
constitutively expressing CysR while lacking active forms
of the McbR and SsuR proteins, and CR032 (mcbRΔHTH
ssuRΔHTH cysRΔHTH) which expresses all three regulators in
inactive forms. By removing activity of the two known regulators mcbR and ssuR in both mutants, only CysRdependent regulation should remain. Deleting only the
helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domains of the regulators instead of full-length deletion allowed for quantification of the remaining transcript. Finally, replacing the
native promoter of cysR by the constitutive promoter of
the neo gene [26], a possible transcriptional auto-regulation of cysR is prevented in the mutant strain CR031. As a
prerequisite, the native promoter of cysR was identified by
mapping the transcription start site using the 5'-RACE
method (data not shown). It was found that the transcriptional start site is identical to the start site of translation,
adding cysR to the growing list of C. glutamicum genes
transcribed as leaderless transcripts. Both strains were
grown in MMS minimal medium with 2 mM L-cysteine as
sole source of sulphur to o.D.600 10 and then subjected to
sulphur starvation as done previously. Applying microarray analysis, 49 genes were found to have increased mRNA
pools in the mutant strain CR031 constitutively expressing an intact CysR, compared to the HTH deletion mutant
CR032, while 48 genes had reduced mRNA levels (Fig. 2).
Among those genes with the highest increase in transcript
abundance were again several genes that also belong to
the McbR regulon, by name cysIXHDNYZ, fpr2, ssuR, and
cg3372-75, supporting the notion that CysR might act as a
transcriptional activator on these genes. Interestingly, neither the SsuR-controlled ssu/seu genes nor the rest of the
McbR-regulated genes detected in the comparison of the
wild type versus CR030 (ΔcysR) were found to be differentially expressed anymore, indicating that there is indeed
strong indirect regulation caused by the other two regulatory networks. For example, the initially observed
decrease in transcript levels of the ssu/seu genes in the
ΔcysR mutant is most likely due to a decrease in transcription of the activator gene, ssuR, and not due to direct control by CysR, validating the complex experimental
approach.
In addition to the McbR-regulated genes with increased
transcription, quite surprisingly, one gene of the McbR
regulon, cg2810, was found to be significantly less transcribed in the mutant with intact CysR. Along with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/483

even stronger repressed genes cg3138-39, this observation
delivered the first indication that CysR might act not only
as a transcriptional activator, but also as a repressor.
To validate these results, the ratios of the mRNA levels of
genes of interest that belong to at least one of the regulons
of McbR, SsuR, or possibly CysR were determined using
real-time RT-PCR (Tab. 1). This approach confirmed the
data from the microarray hybridisations, indicating that
the CysR regulon consists of at least seven transcription
units, by name cysIXHDNYZ, fpr2, ssuR, cg1514-cg4005,
cg2810, cg3138-39, and 3372-75.
2.3 O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) and O-acetyl-L-homoserine
(OAH) are required as effector substances for the binding
of the regulator CysR to DNA
With the transcriptomic studies showing that the mRNA
pools of several transcription units are significantly
altered in response to the presence of an intact CysR, the
direct interaction of CysR with DNA had to be verified. In
addition, possible effectors of CysR and the binding
site(s) should be identified. As a first approach to solve
these questions, gel retardation experiments were carried
out. Therefore, CysR was expressed using the IMPACT system (New England Biolabs; Ipswich, MA) fused with a Cterminal intein/chitin-binding domain. After extensive
optimisation of the cultivation to avoid inclusion body
formation as well as the cell lysis and elution steps (see
Experimental procedures), CysR was purified to homogeneity, carrying only one additional glycine residue at the Cterminal end. Interestingly, CysR could only be eluted in
presence of low concentrations of detergents like Triton X100 (data not shown). In EMSA studies, Cy3-labelled PCR
products of the genomic DNA regions between cysI and
fpr2 as well as upstream of ssuR, cg3372, cg1514, and
cg2810 (approx. 550 bp each) were incubated with this
purified protein and then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, but no bandshift was observed (data not
shown). Previous studies in E. coli had revealed that activation of the pathway for assimilatory sulphate reduction
by CysB is dependent on the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine
(NAS), a derivative of the intermediate OAS [27]. As CysR
is thought to be the functional analogue of CysB, we
tested binding of CysR to the region upstream of cysI in
presence of various intermediates in the biosyntheses of Lcysteine and L-methionine (Fig. 3A). This approach
revealed that CysR can only bind if either OAS or OAH is
added to the assay while addition of L-cysteine, sulphate,
and, in contrast to E. coli, NAS did not affect binding.

This indicates that CysR can only activate transcription of
sulphate assimilation genes if acceptor molecules for the
produced sulphide are available.

then subjected to sulphur starvation for 30 min. Genes showing a strong (|m| ≥ 2) differential expression are named and displayed as green respectively red spots, those without significant differential expression are given as grey spots. Genes belonging
to the McbR regulon are marked in bold type.

After establishing in vitro binding of CysR to DNA, we proceeded to use this system to identify the CysR binding
site(s) in front of the regulated genes. Unfortunately, subsequent tests with OAS-activated CysR led to the finding
of an indiscriminate binding of the activated protein to
DNA in vitro: activated CysR binds as well to Cy3-labelled
negative controls (e.g., to an internal fragment of cg2118
[28]; Fig. 3B) as to unlabelled blocking DNA (Fig. 3C).
Therefore, while useful to identify the presumable co-activators of CysR, for determination of the binding sites the
in vitro approach had to be abandoned in favour of an in
vivo test system.
2.4 A 10 bp inverted repeat is present in the mapped
promoter/operator region of CysR-controlled genes
In order to identify the CysR sites in vivo, as a first step
mapping of the transcription start sites was carried out to
detect the structural elements of possible promoters and
operators. We focused on those genes that are also part of

the McbR regulon, as the McbR binding sites are often
located between the -35 and -10 regions of the promoter
[7], thus facilitating the identification of these elements.
As the start sites of transcription for cysIXHDNYZ and fpr2
had been mapped previously [24], 5'-RACE was used to
determine those of the remaining three McbR-regulated
transcription units. In all three cases, one single start site
could be determined for each transcription unit (Fig. 4A).
In the case of ssuR and cg3372, the McbR binding site is
located directly between the -35 and -10 elements derived
from the σA consensus sequence [29]. But in the case of
cg2810, the McbR binding site is located 14 bp upstream
of the predicted -35 region. Closer inspection of the
region around the McbR binding site in this case revealed
a second, hypothetical promoter that matches closely to
the σA consensus binding motif.
With the transcription start sites mapped, the regions
upstream of the -35 elements of activated promoters

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using purified CysR to identify the co-activators of the protein (A) and
test for specific binding (B+C). CysR was purified using the IMPACT-C system (New England Biolabs) in presence of 0.1%
Triton X-100. A Cy3-labelled 523 bp fragment containing the cysI - fpr2 intergenic region was incubated with a 1,000 times
molar excess of the purified protein in presence of different intermediates of sulphur metabolism (OAS, O-acetyl-L-serine;
NAS, N-acetyl-L-serine; OAH, O-acetyl-L-homoserine) at 10 mM concentration, demonstrating that CysR can only bind to
DNA in presence of either OAS or OAH (A). Tests with OAS-activated CysR and either a negative control (123 bp internal
fragment of cg2118, B) or herring sperm blocking DNA (C) revealed that activated CysR binds non-specifically in vitro.

(PcysIXHDNYZ, Pfpr2, PssuR, and Pcg3372) were searched for the
presence of conserved DNA motifs. In all four cases, two
10 bp motifs that form an inverted repeat and are separated by 6 – 8 bp were found 3 bp upstream of the -35
region (Fig. 4A). As cg2810 is thought to be repressed by
CysR, a search for motifs similar to this inverted repeat
inside and downstream of the cg2810 promoter regions
was performed, identifying two candidate motifs that
overlap with the identified as well as the hypothetical promoter (Fig. 4A). Based on these six instances, a multiple
alignment of the six potential binding sites was created
and visualised as a sequence logo (Fig. 5A; [30]). This
approach indicates that the inverted repeat consists of a
highly conserved 3'-region while the 5'-region appears to
be less conserved, resulting lower information content.
Interestingly, this motif is similar to one present in the
binding sites we identified for the paralogous transcriptional activator SsuR [15]. A multiple alignment of the
SsuR binding sites including two additional base pairs
downstream of the binding site revealed regions which
closely match the inverted repeat that represents the hypothetical CysR binding site (Fig. 5B). Marked differences
include the degree of conservation of several bases in both
regions, the higher degree of conservation in the 5'-region
of the SsuR binding motif and especially the much smaller
distance between the two inverted repeats of only 3 bp.
2.5 CysR-dependent regulation requires the presence of
the identified 10 bp inverted repeat in vivo
To verify these inverted repeats as binding sites for CysR,
several promoter test plasmids based on the promoter-

probe vector pRIM2 [31] were constructed. This vector
allows to determine promoter activity by transcription of
a promoterless cat gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase that can be measured either by real-time RTPCR on the level of the mRNA or by Cat-ELISA (enzyme
linked immuno sorbent assay) on the protein level. In the
current case, two plasmids containing either the core promoter without the inverted repeat or the promoter/operator region including the potential binding site (Fig. 4A;
indicated by coloured bars) were assembled for each of
the four activated transcription units.
In the case of the repressed gene, cg2810, a different
approach was applied, as the potential CysR binding sites
overlap with elements of both promoters. Therefore, the
binding sites could not be completely removed but were
mutated by several transitions at positions outside of the
-35 and -10 regions in either one or both of the two possible CysR binding sites (Fig. 4A; coloured bars, mutated
bases are marked by M). Finally, to collate the relative
importance of the two 10 bp motifs, two mutated versions
of the cysI promoter/operator region were constructed,
each containing three transitions in either the 5'- or the 3'motif at conserved positions (Fig. 5A).
Each of the resulting 14 plasmids was transferred into the
C. glutamicum strains CR031 (constitutively expressing
CysR) and CR032 (cysRΔHTH mutant) by electroporation,
yielding strains CR031-035i to CR031-048i and CR032035i to CR032-048i, respectively. Growth of the resulting
28 strains, RNA preparation and relative quantification of

Mapped 4 and predicted (B) promoter regions of CysR-controlled genes
Mapped (A) and predicted (B) promoter regions of CysR-controlled genes. Transcription start sites (bold, marked
with an arrow and +1) were mapped using the RACE method. The -10 and -35 elements were then inferred either from this
transcription start site (bold black) or the location of either McbR [7] or CysR binding sites (grey elements), based on the published consensus sequences determined by Patek et al. [29]. The potential CysR binding sites are boxed, the inverted repeat is
highlighted in light green with matching bases marked with asterisks. Coloured lines mark the regions cloned into pRIM2 for in
vivo promoter tests, bases mutated by transition are indicted with M.

mRNA levels using real-time RT-PCR were performed as
detailed in Experimental procedures. By comparing the
amount of cat mRNA in strain CR031 (carrying an intact
CysR) to that in strain CR032 (CysR inactive due to missing HTH domain), the effect of CysR on the different promoter constructs can be determined. Using this approach,
it was demonstrated that the predicted binding sites are
indeed involved in CysR-mediated control:
Only if the cloned fragment contains also the predicted
binding site (Fig. 6, promoters labelled with A), the relative cat mRNA amount is significantly increased when cat
is under control of the promoters of cysI, fpr2, ssuR, and
cg3372.
Additional evidence for the importance of the inverted
repeat was added by the two mutated forms of the cysI
promoter: Three transitions in conserved bases in the 5'-

box reduce CysR-mediated induction of the promoter to
22% of the induction level observed with the intact operator region (Fig. 6, PcysI -A and -Am5), while transitions
in three conserved bases of the 3'-box reduce the relative
cat level to that observed with the core promoter (Fig. 6,
PcysI -B and -Am3).
This data is further supported by the results obtained for
the negatively regulated promoter of cg2810: The cloned
promoter with both potential binding sites intact is significantly repressed in presence of an intact CysR (Fig. 6,
Pcg2810-A). This repression does not decrease if the distal
of the two binding sites is mutated (as the proximal site
can still block transcription), but mutation of the proximal site results in a significant de-repression and loss of
both sites completely abolishes transcriptional control by
CysR. All in all, the observed changes in the relative cat
levels strongly support the hypothesis that the inverted

(A) The conserved TGAAtnnAAt motif of the 3'-region (gray box) has a high information content (total height of the characters), which can be assumed to be equivalent to high biological importance. In contrast, the bases flanking the motif are more
or less random, resulting in a very low information content. The 5'-box is only partially conserved but still discernible from the
adjacent sequences. (B) The 3'-region of the SsuR binding site (consensus TGaA [at]nnaaT) is very similar to that of recognised
by CysR. Noticeable differences include the much higher degree of conservation in the 5'region as well as in the spacing of the
regions of 3 bp in every known instance.
repeat is involved in CysR-mediated regulation, especially
as the relative changes in the cat mRNA levels correspond
to the observed changes of the native transcripts (Table 1).
A surprising discovery is the observation that the relative
cat mRNA level actually decreases significantly in strains
expressing an intact CysR if the cat gene is transcribed only
via the "core" promoter of one of the activated genes (Fig.
6, promoters labelled with B). The cause of this effect was
not identified so far but might be linked to RNA polymerase availability [32].

2.6 The proposed regulon of the dual regulator CysR
consists of seven transcription units
To identify additional putative binding sites, a search for
the motif in the upstream regions of genes with significantly changed transcription level in the microarray studies was carried out, using the program Fuzznuc [33]. Only
three instances of a possible binding site were found in
these searches, all of which are located in the upstream
regions of the most strongly regulated genes, by name
cg1514, cg3138, and cysI . In case of the strongly regulated
transcription units cg1514-cg4005 and cg3138-39, the
degree of conservation of the predicted site is rather low
(Fig. 4B). In both cases, a putative promoter is located

either downstream of the putative binding site (in case of
cg1514) or upstream of the binding site (for cg3139),
which corresponds to the observed induction respectively
repression in the microarray data.
Interestingly, a second, well conserved binding site far
upstream of cysI was found. This site overlaps with a putative promoter and that would be repressed in presence of
CysR as well as by McbR and DtxR [34]. The function of
this second promoter remains to be determined, but it
might be used to provide a basal transcription in absence
of CysR: as it matches more closely to the σ70 binding site
[29] than the proximal, CysR-activated promoter, it
should allow transcription even if CysR is missing.

In total, the gathered data indicates that at least seven
transcription units are putatively controlled by the transcriptional regulator CysR, five of which are activated
while two are repressed in presence of activated CysR (Fig.
7).

3 Discussion
3.1 The CysR protein is involved in the activation of the
pathway for assimilatory sulphate reduction and possibly
related genes in C. glutamicum
In this study the C. glutamicum gene cysR (cg0156) was
analysed, a gene which drew attention due to being part
of the regulon of the global regulator of sulphur metabolism, McbR [7]. Transcription of the likewise McbRrepressed gene cluster fpr2 cysIXHDNYZ, which was found

a According

to the studies of [7,15], and this study.
RNA was isolated from C. glutamicum cultures grown in minimal medium with 2 mM L-cysteine as sole sulphur source to o.D.600 10 and then
subjected to sulphur starvation for 30 min. Relative expression levels were measured for two independent replicates with at least three technical
replicates each.

b Total

to be necessary for assimilatory sulphur reduction in C.
glutamicum [24], was found to be dependent on the presence of a functional CysR protein. This, the gathered in
vivo data, and the similarity to the ROK-type transcriptional activator SsuR [15] strongly indicates that CysR acts
as transcriptional activator of these two transcription
units, albeit a specific interaction of CysR with the predicted binding motif could not be shown in vitro. In addition, the obtained data indicates that CysR is involved in
the transcriptional regulation of at least five other transcription units, activating three while repressing two others, depending on the location of the CysR binding site
relative to the promoter. This puts CysR in the class of
dual transcriptional regulators that can act as repressors
and activators, depending on the localisation of the binding site, a class of regulators found more and more to be
common in C. glutamicum [35].
Concerning the uncharacterised members of the CysR regulon, only general assumptions can be made based on the
annotated functions. In case of the strongly induced genes
cg1514 and cg4005, the encoded proteins are thought to
be secreted and Cg1514 was indeed found in the extracellular proteome [36]. As the known genes of the regulon
are involved in providing the cell with reduced sulphur, it
stands to reason that Cg1514 and Cg4005 might be
involved in some sort of sulphur scavenging.
For the repressed gene cg2810, a possible function as
transporter can be proposed. According to UNIPROT and
PFAM it belongs to the sodium/proton-dicarboxylate symporter family which is also involved in the uptake of
amino acids [37]. Based on the observation that Cg2810
is repressed by CysR, a function as the low affinity transporter for cysteine and/or cystine seems possible. This

transporter would not be necessary if the cells are starved
for sulphur as not enough extracellular cyst(e)ine would
be available under those conditions.
For the two remaining transcription units, cg3372-75 and
cg3138-39, no function in sulphur metabolism can be
inferred from either the annotation or bioinformatic analyses. Still, for all these "novel" genes, a detailed functional
analysis might provide interesting new insights into sulphur metabolism, especially of the genes cg3372-75 and
cg2810. As these genes are part of not only the CysR but
also of the McbR regulon, it can be assumed that they play
a major role in sulphur metabolism of C. glutamicum.
3.2 The regulator CysR is a member of the ROK protein
family
The CysR protein from C. glutamicum displays similarity
to transcriptional regulators of the ROK family [14],
although it is at best a distant member. The distance on
the sequence level is accompanied with a switch of effectors: ROK-type repressors usually react to sugar intermediates [38,39] while CysR is controlled by O-acetylated
amino acids. Syntenous orthologues of CysR are present
on the genomes of Corynebacterium efficiens [40] and
Corynebacterium diphtheriae [41] while SsuR might be considered a paralogue (which reacts to inorganic sulphate).

While similarity on the protein level is rather weak, there
is a strong correlation between XylR (repressors of xylose
metabolism in the Firmicutes [38]), Mlc and NagC (which
control the phosphotransferase system in E. coli [42]),
SsuR, and CysR on the level of the binding motif. For Mlc
and NagC, it was shown that they usually bind to inverted
repeats consisting of a T-rich 5'-region and a correspondingly A-rich 3'-region separated by a variable length GC-

Schematic (see previous page)
Figure 7 model of the transcriptional regulation of sulphate reduction in C. glutamicum
Schematic model of the transcriptional regulation of sulphate reduction in C. glutamicum. The transcriptional
repressor McbR acts as a top level regulator, controlling the transcription of its regulon in dependence of the effector S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). Absence of SAH results in repression of gene transcription by active McbR while presence of SAH
leads to inactivation of McbR. This allows at least basic transcription of all McbR-controlled genes, among them those encoding
the regulatory proteins CysR and SsuR as well as those involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction (fpr2 cysIXHDNYZ). The
second level of regulation is monitored by CysR that controls several genes in response to the availability of either O-acetyl-Lserine (OAS) or O-acetyl-L-homoserine (OAH), activating at least five transcription units while repressing two others. Among
the controlled genes are those needed for assimilatory sulphate reduction, the one encoding the transcriptional regulator
SsuR, and several genes of unknown function. Transcriptional regulators are represented by circles and effector metabolites
are given as diamonds. Genes are displayed as boxes with transcriptional activation marked with arrows and repression
marked with dashes.

rich core [42]. In case of CysR as well as for SsuR and XylR
binding sites, the A- and T-rich regions seem to be conserved while the elevated GC-content of the core is not
present in several instances, indicating that the inverted
repeat is more important than the separating spacer. But
this spacer might play a role in the discrimination
between CysR and SsuR binding sites as it is the only consistent difference between the two motifs. The otherwise
high degree of similarity of the binding motifs as well as
the amino acid sequence similarity back the theory that
these two regulators are indeed paralogues, adding a dual
regulator to the heterogeneous ROK protein family.
3.3 The cysR gene is transcribed as leaderless transcript
A interesting finding was that the mapped transcriptional
start sites of cysR as well as of ssuR are identical with the
translation start points of the encoded proteins, adding
them to the growing number of leaderless transcripts of C.
glutamicum. The transcripts of several C. glutamicum genes
which encode proteins involved in amino acid metabolism were shown to belong to this transcript type [29] as
well as the genes necessary for sulphonate (but not sulphonate ester) utilisation [15]. The translation efficiency
of leaderless transcripts depends on several factors, especially the ratio of the initiation factors IF2 and IF3 [43].
This would couple efficient translation of cysR and ssuR to
the growth rate as the IF2:IF3 ratio is thought to be high
during fast cell growth [43]. As it has been speculated that
McbR inactivation, and thereby cysR and ssuR transcription, is also linked to the growth rate via the effector of
McbR, SAH [2], it stands to reason that CysR and thereby
SsuR as well as their respective regulons can be expressed
efficiently only in fast growing cells.
3.4 The presence of sulphide acceptor molecules is
necessary for binding of CysR to DNA
The effector studies clearly demonstrated that CysR binds
to DNA only in the presence of effector metabolites in
vitro. OAS and OAH were demonstrated to enable binding
of CysR to DNA, albeit in a non-specific manner in vitro.
Both OAS and OAH are direct acceptor molecules for sul-

phide, the product of the CysR-activated pathway for
assimilatory sulphate reduction. Thus, production of
highly toxic sulphide is initiated only if it can be directly
converted to less toxic compounds, by name L-cysteine
and L-homocysteine, protecting the cells from sulphide
accumulation. This mechanism is well known from, e.g.,
E. coli: transcription of the genes encoding the sulphate
reduction pathway is dependent on the LysR-type regulator CysB [44] which is in turn modulated by the OASderived metabolite N-acetyl-L-serine (NAS). While CysB
can bind to DNA in absence of NAS, activation of transcription is dependent on that metabolite [45]. Due to the
presence of two acceptor substances for sulphide in C.
glutamicum, the observed direct sensing of these metabolites is a logical extension of the regulatory network.
3.5 The deduced regulatory model of CysR in C.
glutamicum
The collected data of the present and previous studies
[6,7,15,16,24] allows to build a model of the regulation
of sulphur metabolism in C. glutamicum (Fig. 7). Almost
all genes known to be involved in sulphur metabolism are
negatively controlled by the global transcriptional repressor McbR. McbR is in turn negatively controlled by SAH
which is thought to link sulphur metabolism to cell
growth (reviewed in [2]). With an increasing SAH pool,
transcription of the genes under McbR control is derepressed, resulting in the increased expression of the genes
needed to synthesise the sulphur-containing amino acids.
In addition, the two ROK-type regulators CysR and SsuR
are expressed, providing the basis for the subsequent regulatory cascade. The prerequisite to trigger the next step of
the cascade is the accumulation of either OAS or OAH
which are needed for CysR-mediated gene regulation.
Both act as acceptor molecules for sulphide leading to Lcysteine and L-homocysteine in sulphydrylase-catalysed
reactions. Therefore, the CysR-controlled pathway for
assimilatory sulphate reduction is only activated if the
produced sulphide can be directly converted to less toxic
compounds. In turn, the syntheses of both OAS and OAH
are strictly regulated. In case of OAH, the regulation

Page 12 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:483

occurs on the level of transcription by McbR-mediated
control of homoserine O-acetyltransferase (MetX [7,46]).
On the other hand, OAS synthesis is controlled by Lcysteine-mediated feedback-inhibition of serine O-acetyltransferase (CysE [47]). In addition to assimilatory sulphate reduction, CysR might also be involved in the
activation of sulphur scavenging and repression of a possible low-affinity amino acid transporter.
Finally, CysR-mediated activation of ssuR transcription is
necessary to provide for enough SsuR activator to trigger
the bottommost level of regulation. If the available sulphate becomes limiting, SsuR becomes active and induces
expression of the genes involved in uptake and utilisation
of sulphonates and their esters, providing C. glutamicum
with an alternative supply of sulphur, usually abundant in
soils [15]. Interestingly, the regulatory network of sulphur
metabolism in C. glutamicum shares features of the networks of those described for E. coli and Bacillus subtilis: E.
coli lacks a global regulation of sulphur metabolism realised in B. subtilis with the S-box riboswitch [9] and in C.
glutamicum with the McbR regulon. On the other hand,
the current model of a staggered response of the corynebacterial ROK-type activators CysR and SsuR is strongly
reminiscent of the two unrelated LysR-type regulators
CysB and Cbl found in E. coli [48,49] while the McbR/
CysR regulon shares a similar topology like the MetJ/MetR
regulon in E. coli [50].
These similarities in network topology in remote bacterial
phyla indicate a strong selective pressure to evolve such a
topology. This is most evident for the analogous regulator
pair CysB/Cbl from E. coli and CysR/SsuR from C. glutamicum: It stands to argue that the activators of sulphonate
utilisation, Cbl respectively SsuR, are each a result of a
gene duplication event. The resulting paralogues then
took control of the genes needed for sulphonate utilisation. This hypothesis is backed by the similarity on both
the protein level and the similarity of the binding sites. In
E. coli, this results in a still present direct regulation of Cblcontrolled genes by CysB [49,51] while control of the ssu
and seu by CysR has become indirect in C. glutamicum.

Conclusion
With the identification of CysR, the "missing link" in the
regulation of sulphur metabolism in C. glutamicum is now
known, expanding our understanding of the complex regulation of this metabolic module and delivering new,
interesting targets for future functional studies like the
CDS cg1514, cg2810, cg3138, and cg3372.
Concerning the regulation of sulphur metabolism in general, the extension of the characterised members ROK
family is interesting in itself due to the unusual effectors
(for the ROK family). Still, the convergent evolution of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/483

regulatory networks of the completely unrelated transcriptional regulators CysR/SsuR (ROK-type) in C. glutamicum
and, CysB/Cbl (LysR-type) in E. coli is the most striking
finding. Besides the similarity of the regulons, both regulators recognise similar effector molecules and share the
same network topology which seems to be due to independent gene duplication and specialisation events of the
respective ancestral regulators. This indicates that there is
a strong selective pressure to tightly regulate and balance
the metabolism of the essential (but often toxic) sulphur
compounds.

4 Methods
4.1 Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture media
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are
listed in Table 2. E. coli strains carrying plasmids were routinely grown on solid Antibiotic Medium No. 3 (PA)
(Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) at 37°C. C. glutamicum strains
were grown on solid brain-heart broth (BH) (VWR International, Darmstadt, Germany) at 30°C. For growth tests
in liquid medium, MMES minimal medium [24] was used
with addition of different sulfur sources at 100 μM concentration. Cultivations for RNA harvesting were performed in MMS minimal medium [24] with addition of Lcysteine, corn steep liquor (CSL) and yeast extract (YE).
CSL/YE were used as a 20%/20% stock solution derived
by diluting CSL (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany),
adding YE, removing solids by filtration and centrifugation and final sterilisation by filtration.

Antibiotics used for selection of plasmids and strains were
nalidixic acid (50 μg/ml for corynebacteria) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml for E. coli, 25 μg/ml for corynebacteria).
4.2 DNA isolation, transfer and manipulation
Standard procedures were employed for molecular cloning and transformation of E. coli DH5a, as well as for electrophoresis [52]. Transformation of C. glutamicum was
performed by electroporation using the methods published previously [53].
4.3 Polymerase chain reaction experiments
PCR experiments were carried out with either BioTaq Taq
DNA polymerase (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany) for
control reactions or with Phusion high-fidelity DNA
polymerase (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt a. Main,
Germany) for DNA fragments to be used for subsequent
cloning experiments. As templates, chromosomal C.
glutamicum DNA, isolated according to [54], and
pK18mobsacB (for amplification of the neo promoter)
were used. Oligonucleotides used as primers were purchased from Operon Biotechnologies (Cologne, Germany). All PCR setups were done according to the
manufacturers protocols.

4.4 Construction of plasmids
Plasmids pCR030d to pCR034d were constructed using
the gene splicing by overlap extension (gene-SOEing)
method described in [55] with modifications as described
previously [24]. In case of pCR034d, the native promoter
of cysR was replaced with the neo promoter of
pK18mobsacB. Plasmids pCR035i to pCR048i were constructed by using SpeI and BglII restriction sites added by
the PCR primers used to amplify the respective promoter
fragments. After restriction cleavage the inserts were
ligated into XbaI – BamHI digested pRIM2.

Ligation mixtures were used for transformation of E. coli
DH5aMCR, the transformants were selected on PA plates
containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and, if appropriate, 40
mg/l X-Gal.
4.5 Site-specific gene deletion/promoter replacement
Site-specific gene deletion was performed using the nonreplicable integration vector pK18mobsacB which allows
for marker-free deletion of the target gene [56]. The plasmids pCR030d to pCR034d were transferred into C.
glutamicum strains by electroporation [53]. Tests for first
and second cross-over were performed as described previously [46].
4.6 Real-time monitoring of cell growth using
nephelometry
Nephelometry was performed as described in [24], with
sulphur sources used at concentrations of 100 μM each.
Per strain and condition, at least 3 biological replicates
(plates) were measured, with 6 technical replicates (wells)
per plate.
4.7 RNA preparation and DNA microarray hybridisation
Bacterial cell cultures were inoculated in MMS with addition of 0.01% corn steep liquor and 0.01% yeast extract,
containing 2 mM L-cysteine as sulphur source. The cultures were grown to the early logarithmic phase (o.D.600
8 – 12) in a Innova 4430 orbital shaker (New Brunswick,
NJ) at 300 rpm, and 30°C using 10 ml medium in a 100
ml Erlenmeyer flask.

For each experiment, 1010 cells were pelletised by centrifugation, washed once with MMS without added sulphur
source (preheated to 30°C), resuspended in 10 ml preheated MMS without addition of sulphur, and incubated
for an additional 30 min.
For RNA isolation, about 109 cells per culture were harvested by 15 sec centrifugation at 16,000 g, followed by
immediate removal of the supernatant and freezing of the
pellet in liquid nitrogen. Preparation of total RNA from C.
glutamicum cells, cDNA synthesis, and array hybridisation
were performed as described in [25], using 70 mer oligo

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/483

microarrays instead of dsDNA microarrays. Evaluation of
the hybridisation experiment was done as described in
[7], using a m-value cut-off of ± 1, which corresponds to
expression changes equal or greater than twofold. The
scanned arrays were analysed with IMAGENE v6.0 (BioDiscovery Inc.; El Segundo, CA) and statistical analyses were
carried out using the Emma2 software [57].
4.8 Purification of the CysR protein
To purify native CysR protein, the coding region was
cloned into the pTYB1 IMPACT vector (New England
Biolabs, Frankfurt a. Main, Germany). As the C-terminal
proline of CysR would block intein-mediated cleavage, an
additional C-terminal glycine was added via the primer.
The resulting plasmid was transferred into the expression
host strain E. coli ER2566 via electroporation. For protein
purification, 4 aliquots of 250 ml Luria-Bertani Broth (LB)
medium (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) containing 100 μg/ml
ampicillin were inoculated with 2.5 ml freshly grown
overnight culture each (also in LB with addition of 100
μg/ml ampicillin) and transferred to 1,000 ml Erlenmeyer
flasks. The cultures were grown in a Thermoshake orbital
shaker (Gerhardt Analytical Systems, Bonn, Germany) at
150 rpm and 37°C to an o.D.600 of 0.5 – 0.6. To these
cultures IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5
mM and the cultivation temperature was reduced to
15°C. After growth overnight, cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min with 6,000 g at 4°C).

The pellets were collected in 30 ml pre-chilled lysis buffer
(20 mM sodium phosphate and 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0,
with addition of 20 μM PMSF, 1 mM TCEP, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and the cells were lysed using a FRENCH Press
with a pre-cooled 40 K Cell (Thermo Electron, Oberhausen, Germany) in two or three passes with a pressure
of 1,200 psi. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation
(30 min with 6,000 g at 4°C), all further steps were performed according to the IMPACT-CN protocol (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt a. Main, Germany) with the
following changes: For washing, phosphate buffer with
1,000 mM NaCl was used to remove all non-specifically
bound proteins. Cleavage was performed at 4°C for 16 h.
For the elution step, phosphate buffer containing 500 mM
NaCl and 0.1% Triton was used, with ≈ 2 bed volumes
elution buffer.
The resulting protein solution was concentrated using an
Amicon Ultra-4 column (Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany) with an exclusion size of 30 kDa and washed thrice
with 10 volumes phosphate buffer with 50 mM NaCl to
remove excess salt. The purity of the obtained protein was
controlled by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel and the identity
of the protein was checked by tryptic digestion and
MALDI-TOF analysis. Finally, the protein solution was

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:483

diluted to 5 μM CysR protein, shock-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
4.9 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
EMSA studies were performed using Cy3-labelled PCR
products that were amplified with appropriate Cy3labelled 20 mer oligonucleotides and purified with the
NucleoSpin Extract II Kit (Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany).

For EMSA studies, up to 50 pmol purified CysR protein
were added to reaction buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 20% glycerin; pH 7.5)
to get a final volume of 19 μl. If additional reagents, e.g.
effectors or blocking DNA, were added, the amount of
reaction buffer was adjusted accordingly and the assay was
incubated for 10 min at room temperature before addition of labelled DNA. Subsequently, 1 μl of a 50 nM solution of purified, Cy3-labelled PCR product was added to
the mixture and the assay was incubated for (additional)
10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was
separated on a 2% agarose gel prepared in gel buffer (20
mM Na2HPO4; pH 7.0) with a voltage of 14 Vcm-1 applied
for 30 min. For Cy3 detection, the gel was scanned with
the Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham
Biosciences Europe, Freiburg, Germany).
4.10 Determination of transcriptional starts with the RACE
method
Total RNA was isolated from cultures of CR031 and
CR032 grown in MMS medium and subjected to sulphur
starvation as described below. Primers binding approximately 150 bp and 10 bp downstream of the annotated
translational starts of the cysR, ssuR, cg2810, and cg3372
genes along with 1.5 μg of total RNA were used for cDNA
synthesis. The cDNA was then modified and amplified
using the 5'/3' RACE kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) according to the supplier's protocol. The
obtained PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and transferred into E. coli DH10B cells [58]. At least four different
clones per gene were selected for plasmid preparation and
DNA sequencing (IIT Biotech, Bielefeld, Germany).
4.11 Relative mRNA quantification using real-time RTPCR
Growth and harvesting of bacterial cells for total RNA
extraction as well as RNA purification were performed as
described above. Primers for real-time RT-PCR were constructed to amplify intergenic regions of about 150 bp
length of the genes to be analysed. The primers were
designed using the Primer Designer 4.2 software (Sci Ed
Software, Durham, NC) and were purchased from Operon
Biotechnologies (Cologne, Germany).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/483

All real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed using a
LightCycler (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) with the
Quantace SensiMix One-Step Kit (Quantace, Berlin, Germany). PCR mixes were set up and PCR reactions were
performed as described in [16]. All measurements were
performed for two biological replicates per condition
tested and with two technical replicates per biological replicate. The amounts of the mRNAs of the genes of the cluster were normalised on total RNA (300 ng) and the
relative change in transcription rate was determined as 2ΔCP with ΔCP equal to the difference of the measured
crossing points for the test and the control condition.
4.12 GenBank/TrEMBL accession numbers
The nucleotide sequences of cg0156 from C. glutamicum
can be found via the genome entry (accession number
BX927148). The amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein is available under the accession number
CAF18689.
4.13 Bioinformatic analysis
Sequence similarity-based searches with nucleotide and
protein sequences were performed using BLAST, the Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool [59] against the UNIPROT
database [60]. Searches using profile Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) from the Pfam database [19] were done
using the HMMER software package.
