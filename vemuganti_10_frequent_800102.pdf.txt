Abstract
Background: The central metabolic pathway of glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate, with the net production of 2
ATP and 2 NADH per glucose molecule. Each of the ten reactions in this pathway is typically catalyzed by multiple
isozymes encoded by a multigene family. Several isozymes in this pathway are expressed only during
spermatogenesis, and gene targeting studies indicate that they are essential for sperm function and male fertility in
mouse. At least three of the novel glycolytic isozymes are encoded by retrogenes (Pgk2, Aldoart1, and Aldoart2). Their
restricted expression profile suggests that retrotransposition may play a significant role in the evolution of sperm
glycolytic enzymes.
Results: We conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of glycolytic enzymes in the human and mouse genomes
and identified several intronless copies for all enzymes in the pathway, except Pfk. Within each gene family, a single
orthologous gene was typically retrotransposed frequently and independently in both species. Several retroposed
sequences maintained open reading frames (ORFs) and/or provided evidence of alternatively spliced exons. We
analyzed expression of sequences with ORFs and <99% sequence identity in the coding region and obtained evidence
for the expression of an alternative Gpi1 transcript in mouse spermatogenic cells.
Conclusions: Our analysis detected frequent, recent, and lineage-specific retrotransposition of orthologous glycolytic
enzymes in the human and mouse genomes. Retrotransposition events are associated with LINE/LTR and genomic
integration is random. We found evidence for the alternative splicing of parent genes. Many retroposed sequences
have maintained ORFs, suggesting a functional role for these genes.
Background
Although glycolysis is highly conserved, this central metabolic pathway is modified extensively during spermatogenesis. There are several glycolytic isozymes with
restricted expression in the male germline including spermatogenic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDHS) [1,2], phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) [3],
and two aldolase A(ALDOA)-related isozymes
(ALDOART1 and ALDOART2) in mouse [4]. Other
unique sperm isozymes in this pathway are generated by
alternative splicing, including hexokinase 1 variants

(HK1_V1 and HK1_V2) [5-7], ALDOA_V2 [4], and a
pyruvate kinase muscle form isozyme (PK-S) [8]. There is
also evidence that other glycolytic enzymes have unique
functional or structural properties in mammalian sperm,
including glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI1) [9,10], triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) [11], enolase (ENO) [1214], and phosphofructokinase (PFK) [15].
Sperm motility is dependent upon the production of
high levels of ATP in the flagellum [16-18]. Targeted disruption of genes encoding two spermatogenic cell-specific glycolytic enzymes (Gapdhs and Pgk2) demonstrates
an essential role of these enzymes in sperm motility and
male fertility in mice [19,20]. Ldhc, which encodes a germ
cell-specific LDH isozyme for the conversion of pyruvate
to lactate, is also required [21]. A recent study of 1085
patients with male factor infertility found that approximately 81% exhibit defects in sperm motility, with 19%

having no other defects in sperm count or morphology
[22]. The expression of genes that promote high sperm
motility can increase reproductive fitness, while disruptive mutations in genes essential for sperm motility can
hinder proper fertilization, leading to infertility. In
humans, genes involved in spermatogenesis and sperm
motility demonstrate the strongest evidence for positive
selection, and proteins involved in reproduction are
among the most rapidly evolving genes across multiple
species [23,24].
The glycolytic pathway is comprised of ten enzymes,
each encoded by a multigene family [25]. Seven of these
gene families have two to five intron-containing genes,
while the Gpi1, Tpi1, and Pgk families each have only one.
Within a family, each gene encodes a different isoform
with a unique expression pattern [25]. Many of these gene
families arose by multiple rounds of segmental gene
duplication in the last 150 million years [25]. Genes
encoding spermatogenic cell-specific glycolytic isozymes
were generated by either segmental gene duplication
(Gapdhs) or retrotransposition (Pgk2, Aldoart1,
Aldoart2) [3,4,26,27]. Pgk2 represent an ancient retrotransposition event shared by all eutherian mammals,
while Aldoart1 and Aldoart2 are only found in the rodent
lineage and are much more recent [4,28]. In addition, frequent retrotransposition of the Gapdh and Aldoa genes
has been reported in both human and mouse, based on
an abundance of pseudogenes [29-32].
Theoretically, retrotransposition can occur in any cell
type, but the retrotransposition event is only transmitted
to future generations when it takes place in the germline
[33-36]. Retrotransposition is facilitated by repetitive elements (including LINE and LTR elements), resulting in
the creation of pseudogenes or retrogenes [37]. In the
human lineage most LTR elements have been extinct for
over 40 million years. However, LINE elements are still
active and are, therefore, thought to be responsible for
most retroposed mRNA sequences [37]. The proteins
encoded by LINE elements provide both endonuclease
and reverse transcriptase activities required for retrotransposition. These proteins, ORF1 and ORF2, are
expressed in testicular germ cells undergoing meiosis, a
period when retrotransposition is thought to occur
[34,36,38]. In fact, retrotransposition is responsible for
the creation of many retrogenes expressed only during
the meiotic and/or haploid phases of spermatogenesis,
including but not limited to Pgk2, G6pd2, and Pabp2
[3,26,39,40]. At least 10% of retroposed sequences with
open reading frames (ORF) are transcribed during spermatogenesis [38,41-43]. Positive selection of sperm proteins, combined with frequent retrotransposition to
create genes encoding sperm-specific proteins, results in
the faster evolution of genes involved in sperm function
[44].

Based on the existence of Pgk2 and Aldoa-related retrogenes and their restricted expression during spermatogenesis, we hypothesized that there may be additional
retrogenes that encode novel sperm glycolytic enzymes.
Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis to identify all human and mouse retroposed
sequences that are derived from genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. We analyzed the gene structure of these
sequences and determined which copies maintain ORFs,
are transcribed, and may encode sperm-specific isoforms
of glycolytic enzymes. Unique features of sperm glycolytic isozymes may be important for localization of this
pathway in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum or
for altered regulation or kinetic properties that may be
required to sustain sperm metabolism and motility in this
highly polarized cell. Taken together, identification of all
sperm-specific glycolytic enzymes will improve our
understanding of sperm metabolism at a molecular level
and may provide insights regarding the rapid evolution of
genes required for reproduction.

Results
Frequent retrotransposition of orthologous genes
encoding glycolytic enzymes occurred independently in
the mouse and human genomes

There are 25 intron-containing genes in the ten gene families that compose the glycolytic pathway (Table 1). We
used BLAST to identify sequences with significant
sequence similarity to each parent gene (see Methods for
details). This analysis identified retroposed sequences in
the human and mouse genomes in every family of glycolytic enzymes, except phosphofructokinase (Pfk). Major
conclusions from this analysis are:
▪ Retrotransposition of genes encoding glycolytic
enzymes is frequent. We identified 94 matching retroposed sequences in the human genome and 291 in the
mouse genome. Our analysis confirms that the mouse
genome contains significantly more retroposed
sequences than the human genome [45].
▪ As a rule, only one gene within each family is retroposed (bolded font in Table 1).
▪ The same orthologous gene is retroposed in the
human and mouse genomes. This is always true in
cases where there is more than one retroposed
sequence. The two exceptions to this rule, hexokinase
(Hk) and phosphoglycerate mutase (Pgam), have a
single retroposed sequence in one or both species. In
the human genome HK2 is retroposed, while Hk1 is
retroposed in the mouse genome. There is also a single Pgam5 retroposed sequence in mouse in addition
to multiple retroposed sequences for Pgam1 in both
species.

(Additional file 1) and mouse (Additional file 2)

genomes appears to be random. There is no region or
chromosome with an overrepresentation of retroposed sequences. There is also evidence for segmental gene duplication of retrotransposed sequences.
▪ Retrotransposition events occurred independently
in each lineage following the divergence of primates
and rodents. Phylogenetic analysis was inconclusive
in determining the strict order of retrotransposition
events due to the high levels of sequence identity
between retroposed sequences and parent genes.
Analysis of genes flanking retroposed sequences confirmed that these events occurred independently in
each species (Additional file 3).
▪ Human retroposed sequences derived from genes
encoding glycolytic enzymes are more divergent from
their parent genes than mouse retroposed sequences
(Figure 1). Figure 1 groups retroposed sequences
matching glycolytic enzymes by the percent nucleotide substitution in the entire sequence (ORFs and
UTRs) compared to the parent gene. Human retroposed sequences are 82-100% identical to their parent
genes, with a mean nucleotide identity of 89.2%.
Mouse retroposed sequences have the same range of
nucleotide identity, although the mean identity is
93.4%.

testis transcripts (data not shown). Gpi-rs1 was the only
mouse retroposed sequence that showed less than 99%
sequence identity at the nucleotide (Figure 2) and amino
acid level (Additional file 5). These results indicate that
several retroposed sequences matching glycolytic
enzymes in both the human and mouse genomes have
ORFs, supporting possible expression of these sequences.
Detection of splice variants in the glycolytic enzyme parent
genes

Analysis of retroposed sequences derived from glycolytic
enzyme genes support the expression of alternative transcripts from the parent genes in both the human and
mouse. Two retroposed sequences in humans (ALDOArs1 and TPI1-rs3) suggest alternative splicing of internal
exons (represented as boxes with diagonal lines in Figure
2). For example, TPI1-rs3 is missing 2 full consecutive
exons and part of a third, but still contains sequence that

3-6% of retroposed sequences have ORFs

6.3% of human and 3.4% of mouse retroposed sequences
derived from genes encoding glycolytic enzymes contain
ORFs equivalent to the full-length ORF present in the
parent gene (Figure 2). This value includes the previously
identified Pgk2, Aldoart1, and Aldoart2 retrogenes. In
this study we identified five new retroposed sequences
with ORFs in the human genome and seven new retroposed sequences with ORFs in the mouse genome (Figure
2, related sequences [rs] denoted with red and yellow bars
representing segments that match exons in the parent
gene). Numbers next to each gene structure indicate the
percent identity of the coding region in each retroposed
sequence compared to the parent gene.
Three of the five human retroposed sequences with
ORFs (TPI1-rs1, PGAM1-rs7, ENO1-rs1) showed substantial divergence from their parent genes at both the
nucleotide (Figure 2) and amino acid level (Additional file
4). For example, the ORF of PGAM1-rs7 is only 98.3%
identical at the nucleotide level and encodes 11 unique
amino acid residues. The mouse sequences we identified
are more similar to their parent genes (99.6% identity)
that humans sequences (97.4%). Six of seven mouse retroposed sequences had ORFs with >99% nucleotide and
amino acid identity to their parent genes (Figure 2). Two
of these sequences, Pgk1-rs1 and Pgk1-rs2, had less than
99% nucleotide identity in the 3'UTR due to a 5-base-pair
insertion that we did not detect in RT-PCR analyses of

Figure 2 Retroposed sequences support the expression of novel transcripts. The structure of each parent gene is diagrammed with the coding
sequence denoted by alternating yellow and red exons. Retroposed sequences with ORFs have red and yellow segments corresponding to exons in
the parent gene. Upstream start codons (black exons), and/or alternatively spliced exons (diagonal lined boxes) are also shown. Sequences containing
LINE elements are denoted by horizontal lines. Coding regions for retroposed sequences with ORFs were compared to their parent gene, and the
percent identity at the nucleotide level is shown next to the corresponding gene structure.

matches part of the last TPI1 exon. Alternative splicing is
also supported by two mouse retroposed sequences
(Gpi1-rs1 and Eno1-rs5). For example, Eno1-rs5 matches
full-length Eno1, except for a deletion of half of exon 10,
exon 11 and half of exon 12 (boxes with lines, Figure 2).
The remaining 3'UTR is maintained, without the coding
sequence of the last exon. However, we did not detect
expression of these splice variants in published EST
libraries.
Detection of N-terminal extensions in the glycolytic
enzyme parent genes

Some spermatogenic-cell specific glycolytic enzymes are
modified through the addition of amino acid residues at
the N-terminus, including GAPDHS, ALDOA_V2 and
ALDOART1 [2,4]. Our previous analysis supported the
retrotransposition of an alternative splice variant

(Aldoa_v2) to produce a novel gene encoding an N-terminal extension (Aldoart1) [4]. In this study, we found that
multiple mouse and human retroposed sequences have
upstream start codons, supporting the expression of transcripts that encode additional glycolytic enzymes with Nterminal extensions. Three human sequences (TPI1-rs1,
PGK1-rs1 and PGAM1-rs6) and nine mouse sequences
(Gpi1-rs1, Tpi1-rs5, Eno1-rs5, 9, and Pkm2-rs1, 2, 3, 4, 8)
contain upstream start codons (black exons, Figure 2). In
most cases, comparison of the amino acid sequence in
these N-terminal extensions reveal a unique origin for
these extensions that is independent from the parent
genes (Additional file 6), since the alignment does not
show a high level of identity. Five retroposed sequences
matching Pkm2 in mice contain N-terminal extensions.
Previous studies detected a larger Pkm2 protein in boar

and mouse sperm [8,46]. Proteomic evidence from boar
sperm suggests extension of the N-terminus by at least
five amino acids [8]. Our sequence analysis of Pkm2 retropseudogenes with upstream start codons in the mouse
genome shows partial agreement with the previously
identified five-amino-acid extension, but does not clearly
elucidate the start codon responsible for the larger protein product detected in sperm (Additional file 6).
Novel ORFs with divergent sequences are not expressed in
human testis

Our expression analyses in both species focused on retroposed sequences with less than 99% identity at the nucleotide level and did not include the large number of
sequences derived from GAPDH. Due to high sequence
similarity at the nucleotide level, we used Single Strand
Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) gel electrophoresis
to examine potential expression of three retroposed
sequences in human testis (Figure 3A). In this method
RT-PCR products are denatured into two strands and
separated based upon individual nucleotide differences,
allowing us to distinguish between sequences with very
high levels of identity. Expression of protamine 1 (PRM1),
a spermatid-specific transcript, was detected in human
cDNA preparations, confirming complete spermatogenesis in the pooled testes tissues used for RNA isolation. We
used genomic DNA to identify the migration pattern of
the PCR products amplified from the retroposed
sequences (G1 and G2, Figure 3B). With primers specific
for TPI-rs1, PGAM1-rs7, and ENO1-rs1, RT-PCR did not
amplify products from human testis RNA that match the
retroposed sequence fragments amplified from genomic
DNA (Figure 3B). Therefore, we did not detect testis
expression of the human retroposed sequences with
ORFs that were analyzed in this study.
Expression of an alternative Gpi1 transcript in mouse
spermatogenic cells

Gpi1-rs1 maintains an ORF, despite missing two internal
exons (Figure 4A). The open reading frame of Gpi1-rs1
suggests the expression of this retroposed sequence and/
or a Gpi1 splice variant missing exons 5 and 6 (Gpi1_v2).
RT-PCR expression analysis in mouse tissues revealed a
testis-specific transcript of glucose phosphate isomerase,
representative of Gpi1_v2 and/or Gpi1-rs1 (Figure 4B).
This transcript was also detected in both pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids isolated from mouse
testis, but not in later germ cells (condensing spermatids)
or Sertoli cells. The same band was detected in human
testis, but due to the absence of Gpi1-rs1 in the human
genome, must represent the expression of GPI1_V2 (data
not shown).
To distinguish between Gpi1_v2 and Gpi1-rs1 expression, we designed PCR primers to specifically detect

to amplify both parent gene and retroposed sequences. The fraction

ENO1- rs1 transcripts were not detected in pooled human testis RNA
samples with RT-PCR using primers that amplify both the retroposed
sequence and the parent glycolytic enzyme, followed by single-strand
conformation polymorphism (SSCP) gel electrophoresis. PCR products
amplified from human genomic DNA (G1 and G2; two individuals)
show the expected position of transcripts from retroposed sequences.

expression of Gpi1-rs1 (Figure 4A). Using this approach,
we did not detect a Gpi1-rs1-specific product (Figure 4B,
bottom panel), indicating that PCR products initially
detected in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (Figure 4B, top panel) are most likely derived from
Gpi1_v2 transcripts.
We detected expression of the GPI1 protein in various
tissues and germ cells isolated from mouse testis (Figure
4C). GPI1 has 553 amino acids, while GPI1_V2 has 476
amino acids since it is missing sequence encoded by
exons 5 and 6 (Additional file 5). GPI1-rs1 is also missing
sequence encoding exons 5 and 6 but contains an N-terminal extension and is, therefore, 485 amino acids (Additional file 5). The predicted molecular weights of GPI1,
GPI1_V2, and GPI1-rs1 are 62,800, 54,500 and 55,100,
respectively. We detected a protein band that migrates
with an apparent molecular weight of ~55,000 in all tissues analyzed. This band is assumed to be GPI1 due to its
ubiquitous expression pattern. We also identified a larger
immunoreactive band that was seen only in isolated spermatogenic cells (Figure 4C). This protein is not present in
human or mouse sperm and is larger than the predicted
molecular weights of GPI1_V2 and GPI1-rs1. We also
found that glucose phosphate isomerase is soluble in the
supernatant fraction following sonication of mouse

from Gpi1 transcripts not containing exons 5 and 6. A product of the
same size was detected in isolated pachytene spermatocytes (PS) and
round spermatids (RS), but not condensing spermatids (CS). This PCR
fragment appears to be derived from Gpi1_v2, since Gpi1_rs1-specific
primers did not amplify a product. (C) A smaller GPI1_V2 protein was
not detected by western analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised
against human GPI1. A larger protein product was seen in isolated testicular cell, but not in mouse or human (Hs) sperm. S/N fraction contains proteins solubilized from sperm tail following brief sonication
and centrifugation. Tail fraction contains proteins left insoluble following sonication and centrifugation.

sperm (S/N, Figure 4C). Since GPI1 is not found in insoluble fractions of mouse sperm, it is not tightly bound to
the fibrous sheath, the cytoskeletal structure in the sperm
flagellum that binds multiple glycolytic enzymes with
unique N-terminal extensions [4]. Although we were
unable to distinguish GPI1_V2 in our Western analysis,
we identified an alternative splice variant of Gpi1 that is
transcribed in spermatogenic cells of the mouse testis.
Repetitive elements are overrepresented in sequence
flanking retroposed sequences

The Aldoart1 sequence provided evidence for an alternative splice variant (Aldoa_v2) of aldolase A that is also

Page 7 of 14

expressed during spermatogenesis [4]. In our analyses of
other retroposed sequences, we examined flanking
sequences for evidence of alternative splicing or additional coding sequence, particularly at the N-terminus.
Analysis of 1 kb sequence both upstream and downstream of all human and mouse retroposed sequences did
not identify additional coding sequences. Instead, we
found a significant (p < 0.01) increase in the number of
repetitive elements, particularly LINE and LTR elements,
in regions that flank retroposed sequences compared to
the regions that flank the parent genes (intron-containing
genes encoding the glycolytic enzymes) (Additional file
7).
We calculated the percent frequency of both LINE and
LTR elements at each base pair within 1 kb upstream and
downstream of each retroposed sequences, as compared
to intron-containing parent genes encoding glycolytic
enzymes. We observed an increase in LINE and LTR elements along the entire 1 kb immediately upstream or
downstream of retroposed sequences (Figure 5A).
Because LINE elements are found preferentially in (A +
T)-rich regions of the genome [45], we expected a low (G
+ C) content in the flanking regions (10 kb) of retroposed
sequences. Surprisingly, we found that the (G + C) content matched the (G + C) content of the entire genome
for both species (Figure 5B). Therefore, these retroposed
sequences and flanking repetitive elements are not preferentially located in (A + T) rich regions. We dated the
repeated elements by comparing their nucleotide divergence from their respective consensus sequences, and
then compared these values to the nucleotide divergence
of the corresponding retroposed glycolytic sequence
from the corresponding parent gene (data not shown).
We find that there is no correlation.

Discussion
We found frequent retrotransposition of one member in
each gene family encoding the glycolytic enzymes.
Remarkably, the orthologous gene is retroposed independently in the human and mouse genomes. Phylogenetic
analyses indicate that the retroposed parent gene is not
the most slowly-evolving gene in each gene family
[25,31]. In support of this conclusion, phylogenetic trees
for five representative glycolytic enzymes are shown in
Additional file 8. Although at least one retrogene, Pgk2, is
present in all eutherian mammals [47], most of the retroposed sequences identified in this analysis arose following the primate-rodent split. Many factors may
contribute to preferential retrotransposition of a single
orthologous gene in each gene family in both species.
Germline expression of the parent gene is required for
retrotransposition events that can be transmitted to
future generations. Retroposed parent genes in the glycolytic pathway are expressed in testicular germ cells,

Figure 5 Abundance of repetitive elements flanking retroposed sequences and (G + C) content. (A) Diagram comparing the frequency of LINE
and LTR elements in regions flanking retroposed sequences (grey) or genes encoding all glycolytic enzymes (black). (B) (G + C) content (%) of combined upstream and downstream 10 kb sequence flanking human (grey) and mouse (black) retroposed sequences.

including Hk1, Gpi1, Aldoa, Tpi1, Gapdh, Pgk1, Pgam1,
Eno1 and Pkm2 [2,4,7,9,11,48-51]. These studies and
microarray analyses of isolated spermatogenic cells http:/
/mrg.genetics.washington.edu/[52] indicate that glycolytic enzyme genes that are retroposed (Table 1) are
expressed during early mitotic (spermatogonia) and/or
meiotic (spermatocytes) stages of spermatogenesis in the
mouse. The same microarray studies indicate that several
glycolytic enzyme genes that are not retroposed are not
expressed during spermatogenesis (Hk3, Aldob, Aldoc,
Eno2 and Pklr) or are expressed only during the haploid
period (Gapdhs). mRNA abundance and stability, as well
as short length and nucleotide sequence, may contribute
to preferential retrotransposition [53-55],
Along with expression of the parent gene, the machinery that facilitates retrotransposition of mRNA transcripts must also be expressed in the same developmental

stage/cell type of the germline. ORF1 and ORF2, the
LINE element-encoded proteins that provide RNA-binding and enzymatic activities required for retrotransposition, are expressed in testicular germ cells, including
preleptotene and zygotene spermatocytes [34,36]. We
found an overrepresentation of LINE and LTR repetitive
elements flanking retroposed sequences derived from
genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, but no evidence that
both events occurred simultaneously. These retroposed
sequences and flanking repetitive elements are not found
in (A + T) rich regions, where LINE and LTR elements
are normally found [45], suggesting a distinct mechanism
for the genomic integration of these sequences compared
to repetitive elements alone.
Our genomic analyses of retroposed sequences identified Aldoart1 and Aldoart2, two newly identified retrogenes in mouse [4], and may provide additional insights

regarding the process of retrotransposition and the evolution of expressed retrogenes. We determined that the
gene families encoding glycolytic enzymes have single
members that are frequently retrotransposed, resulting in
the creation of multiple gene copies in the genome. This
high frequency suggests that most mammalian species,
including those that are phylogenetically close, are likely
to differ in the number and function of glycolytic
enzymes. Some of the retroposed sequences have ORFs,
due either to very recent retrotransposition events providing very little time for the accumulation of sequence
divergence, or to selective pressure exerted on sequences
that are expressed. Sequences with ORFs that are
expressed in testicular germ cells may be acted upon by
selective pressure in the context of reproductive fitness,
and it is known that there is rapid evolution of genes
involved in reproduction [24].
It is well known that gene duplication, including retrotransposition, provides the opportunity for the duplicated genes to diverge by mutation and eventually change
or acquire new functions. In contrast with other tissues,
the evolution of the glycolytic pathway in spermatogenic
cells is focused on insuring the production of high levels
of ATP in the sperm flagellum. There are a surprising
number of glycolytic variants in mammalian sperm, and
recent studies continue to uncover new enzymes and regulatory features of both glycolytic and other metabolic
enzymes. For example, it is now clear that glycolysis and
respiration occur in two distinct compartments of the
sperm flagellum, adding complexity to the typical regulatory interactions of these metabolic pathways [56]. Furthermore, at least five glycolytic enzymes are tightly
bound to the fibrous sheath, a cytoskeletal structure in
the principal piece of the flagellum [4,46]. These include
multiple germ cell-specific isozymes with novel N-terminal extensions that are hypothesized to play a role in
localizing glycolysis in the principal piece, thereby insuring an adequate supply of ATP along the full length of the
flagellum. Adaptations during the ongoing evolution of
glycolysis have involved the rapid emergence of new
genes by duplication and retrotransposition, the acquisition of distinct expression patterns in male germ cells,
changes in the enzymatic properties, and novel structural
features that facilitate compartmentalization of the glycolytic pathway in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum.

Conclusions
We identified frequent retrotransposition in both the
human and mouse genomes of a single orthologous gene
in each gene family encoding glycolytic enzymes. Integration of retrotransposition events is random. Many of
these retroposed sequences have ORFs and some support
the expression of alternative splice variants and N-termi-

nal extensions. These sequences are lineage-specific and
many are recent, indicating that similar genomic analyses
in other organisms may identify additional genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. Several of the retroposed
sequences identified in this study have retained ORFs
despite substantial sequence divergence, suggesting functional importance. Glycolysis is essential for sperm motility and fertilization. It is likely that selective pressure in
the context of reproductive fitness contributes to the evolution of novel isozymes in this pathway.

was used to identify the intron-containing genes for each
glycolytic enzyme [57]. We used Ensembl release 48 (Dec

BLAST search for retroposed sequences

We blasted the mRNA sequence for each gene encoding a
glycolytic enzyme using Ensembl BlastView in order to
identify retroposed sequences in both the human and
mouse genomes. We grouped BLAST hits based upon

Vemuganti et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:285
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/285

chromosome location and orientation. Multiple hits in
close vicinity and with the same orientation were
grouped together in a single hit that span the entire
genomic sequences between and upstream/downstream
of hits. Hits with less 50 base pairs were excluded. By
comparing BLAST results between gene family members,
we identified the parent gene for each retroposed
sequence. For each retroposed sequence, we identified
the parent gene by choosing matches with the longest hit
and the highest percentage match. Using the BLAST
results, we calculated the weighted average of the nucleotide identity of all retroposed sequences matching glycolytic enzymes. Ensembl was used to retrieve the FASTA
sequence for each retroposed sequence on the appropriate strand.
Sequence alignment

All retroposed sequences were aligned with their parent
gene with Sequencher 4.8 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI). We used large gap parameters and a 60%
identity threshold to align all sequences to the reference
sequence (the parent gene). We examined the nucleotide
sequence corresponding to the exons of the parent gene
and identified insertions, deletions, and base pair substitutions. We then calculated the percent identity of the
coding sequence and looked for an ORF. Amino acid
sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html[58].
Tissue and cell isolations

Outbred CD-1 mice were obtained from Charles River
(Raleigh, NC). All procedures involving animals were
approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in
accordance with the Guide for the care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute for Laboratory Animal
Research, National Academy of Sciences).
All tissues were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept
at -80°C until use. Testicular germ cells were isolated
using an established protocol [59]. Briefly, we purified
pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and condensing spermatids by unit gravity sedimentation from
adult mixed germ cell suspensions [59]. Pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids have purities >90%,
while condensing spermatids have 30-40% nucleated cells
and cytoplasts derived from the same cells. Testes from
17-day-old mice were used to isolate Sertoli cells, as previously described [60].
Mouse sperm was collected as previously described [4].
Briefly, each cauda epididymis was clipped and incubated
for 15 minutes at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline with
protease inhibitors (PBS + PI) containing 140 mM NaCl,
10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and Complete protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Ger-

many). Cryopreserved human sperm samples from
healthy donors were obtained from the Andrology Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine. These
samples were washed twice with PBS to remove seminal
plasma.
RT-PCR expression analysis of newly identified retroposed
sequences in mouse and human tissues and cells

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from isolated testicular cells or tissues pooled
from at least three mice. Adult tissues included brain,
heart, ovary and testis. The Qiagen RNeasy Midi Kit
(Qiagen Incorporation, Valencia, CA) was used to
remove genomic DNA contamination from RNA preparations. RNA was quantified using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington,
DE). Human RNA prepared from tissues pooled from 39
individuals was purchased from Clontech (Mountainview, CA). Genomic DNA isolated from CD-1 mice and
two human subjects were used as positive controls for
detected of PCR-amplified retrogenes. Reverse transcription followed by gene-specific polymerase chain reaction
(Superscript RT II, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; Taq DNA
polymerase, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) was
used to amplify transcripts from total RNA samples.
Two primer pairs were designed to detect expression of
Gpi1-related transcripts in mouse RNA samples. The first
primer pair distinguishes between transcripts that contain alternatively spliced exons 5 and 6 (Figure 4A): Gpi1F
in exon 4 (5'GAGGTGAACAGGGTTCTGGA3'), Gpi1R
in exon 11 (5'GCTCGAAGTGGTCAAAACC3'). The
expected product sizes are as follows: Gpi1, 520 base
pairs; Gpi1_v2/Gpi1-rs1, 288 base pairs. The second
primer pair is specific for Gpi1-rs1F in exon 4
(5'ATCAAGGTGGTCGGG3'), Gpi1-rs1 R in exon 10
(5'CAATGGAAGGTCCAG3'). We also included a negative control with no reverse transcriptase as a control for
genomic DNA contamination. All PCR products were
resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized
by ethidium bromide staining using UV detection.
To detect expression of human retroposed sequences,
primers were designed to amplify and incorporate α[32P]-dCTP into the same size product from the parent
gene and the retroposed sequences of interest: Tpi1/
Tpi1-rs1, Pgam1/Pgam1-rs1, and Eno1/Eno1-rs1. The
forward primer sequence for Tpi1/Tpi1-rs1 was
5'CCGACACCGAGGTGGTTT3' and the reverse primer
sequence was 5'GTTCTGCGCAGCCACAGCAA3'. The
forward primer sequence for Pgam1/Pgam1-rs1 was
5'GCAGACCTCACAGAAGATCAG3' and the reverse
primer sequence was 5'ACAGATGTGGTCAGTGTGACA T3'. The forward primer sequence for Eno1/Eno1rs1 was 5'TTGGGAAAGCTGGCTACACT3' and the

Vemuganti et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:285
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/285

reverse primer sequence was 5' CCAGTCATCCTGGTCAAAGG 3'. Arrows in Figure 3A denote the location of
these primers in each gene.
As a positive control to confirm proper spermatogenesis in human testis samples, we detected expression of
protamine 1 (Prm1) in RNA samples. We also included a
negative control with no reverse transcriptase as a control
for genomic DNA contamination. The forward primer
sequence for Prm1 was 5'TCACAGGTTGGCTGGC
TC3'and
the
reverse
primer
sequence
was
5'CATTGTTCCTTAGCAGGCTCC3' [61]. Following
PCR amplification with both primer sets, the products
were resolved by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) electrophoresis using MDE gel solution
(Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) at 0.5 W for 19 hours.
Genomic DNA was used as a control template in parallel
PCR reactions to confirm the expected electrophoretic
pattern of the retroposed sequences. Gels were exposed
to Super RX X-ray film (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) using
intensifying screens to detect incorporation of α-[32P]dCTP into amplified products.
Western analysis of GPI1-related proteins

Lysis buffer (2% SDS, 100 mM DTT, 125 mM Tris pH 6.8,
18% glycerol) was used to extract proteins from tissues or
isolated cells. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for
10 min at 4°C following homogenization. Protein concentrations were determined using the micro-BCA assay
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). SDS polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 7.5% polyacrylamide
gels was used to separate samples with equal protein
amounts, followed by electrophoretic transfer to Immobilon-P PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membranes (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA). Equal protein loading was
confirmed by Coomassie blue R250 staining (0.1% Coomassie blue R250 in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid).
Membranes were destained, rinsed with TBS-T (140 mM
NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.4) and incubated in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk
in TBS-T) overnight at 4°C. Antibody incubations were
performed at room temperature in blocking buffer. Membranes were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant human
glucose phosphate isomerase protein fragment (Strategic
Diagnostic Incorporation, Newark, DE) for 2 hours.
Membranes were then incubated for 45 min at room temperature with secondary antibody (affinity-purified
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG,
KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted 1:10,000. Following antibody incubations, membranes were rinsed for 5 minutes
with TBS-T. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal
West Pico substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL)
and HyBlot CL autoradiography film (Denville Scientific,
Metuchen, NJ).

Repetitive Element Analysis

Galaxy http://galaxy.psu.edu was used to obtain both 1 kb
and 10 kb FASTA format sequence flanking retroposed
sequences and genes encoding glycolytic enzymes [62].
We analyzed FASTA format sequence for all retroposed
sequences, 1 kb flanking retroposed sequences and 1 kb
flanking genes encoding glycolytic enzymes for the presence of repetitive elements using Repeatmasker http://
www.repeatmasker.org. We calculated the percent frequency of repetitive elements (LINE, LTR, and SINE) in
each base pair within 1 kb upstream or downstream of
retroposed sequences or genes encoding glycolytic
enzymes. Chi-square values were calculated using a contingency table comparing mouse and human sequences
versus glycolytic enzymes and retroposed sequences for
each repetitive element. (G + C) content was calculated
using the eMBOSS geecee program http://inntemp.weizmann.ac.il/cgi-bin/emboss/geecee[63].
BLAST search for extensions

Repeatmasker http://www.repeatmasker.org was used to
generate sequence with the repetitive elements masked
(represented by "n") [64]. We repeatmasked the 1 kb
sequence flanking all retroposed sequences and used
Ensembl BLAST to compare this sequence to the mouse
or human genome. We looked for matches with genomic
locations close to either the parent gene or other retroposed sequences, indicative of a sequence extension at
the end of the gene.
Dating retroposed sequences

We dated the repeated elements by comparing their
nucleotide divergence from their respective consensus
and then compared these values to the nucleotide divergence of the corresponding retroposed glycolytic
sequence to the corresponding parent gene. In addition,
we determined whether retroposed sequences are located
at homologous position of the human and mouse genome
by determining the position of the flanking genes in the
appropriate species. We then found the position of the
homologous genes in the others species using comparative maps http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/homology/maps/. Finally, to determine the evolutionary history
of genes within each gene family and their rate of divergence we aligned the coding sequence using ClustalW
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html[58]
and constructed a distance tree using the Neighbor Joining method from the PHYLIP package http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/.
