lipid biosynthesis

Abstract
Background: Triacylglycerides (TAGs) are a class of neutral lipids that represent the most important storage form of
energy for eukaryotic cells. DGAT (acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.20) is a transmembrane enzyme
that acts in the final and committed step of TAG synthesis, and it has been proposed to be the rate-limiting enzyme
in plant storage lipid accumulation. In fact, two different enzymes identified in several eukaryotic species, DGAT1 and
DGAT2, are the main enzymes responsible for TAG synthesis. These enzymes do not share high DNA or protein
sequence similarities, and it has been suggested that they play non-redundant roles in different tissues and in some
species in TAG synthesis. Despite a number of previous studies on the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes, which have
emphasized their importance as potential obesity treatment targets to increase triacylglycerol accumulation, little is
known about their evolutionary timeline in eukaryotes. The goal of this study was to examine the evolutionary
relationship of the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes across eukaryotic organisms in order to infer their origin.
Results: We have conducted a broad survey of fully sequenced genomes, including representatives of Amoebozoa,
yeasts, fungi, algae, musses, plants, vertebrate and invertebrate species, for the presence of DGAT1 and DGAT2
gene homologs. We found that the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes and are readily
identifiable in all the major eukaryotic groups and genomes examined. Phylogenetic analyses of the DGAT1 and
DGAT2 amino acid sequences revealed evolutionary partitioning of the DGAT protein family into two major DGAT1
and DGAT2 clades. Protein secondary structure and hydrophobic-transmembrane analysis also showed differences
between these enzymes. The analysis also revealed that the MGAT2 and AWAT genes may have arisen from
DGAT2 duplication events.
Conclusions: In this study, we identified several DGAT1 and DGAT2 homologs in eukaryote taxa. Overall, the data
show that DGAT1 and DGAT2 are present in most eukaryotic organisms and belong to two different gene families.
The phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses revealed that DGAT1 and DGAT2 evolved separately, with functional
convergence, despite their wide molecular and structural divergence.

Background
Triacylglycerols (TAGs), fatty acyl ester derivatives of
glycerol, are a class of neutral lipids that represent the
most important storage form of energy for eukaryotic
cells [1,2]. In a number of plant species, TAGs are
major storage lipids that accumulate in developing

seeds, petals, pollen grains, and fruits [3]. Plant oils have
been used for human consumption and have become
important renewable resources as biofuels [4,5]. The
enzymatic machinery for the formation of TAGs is
located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TAGs can
then accumulate as oil droplets in the cytoplasm or in
specialized oil storage bodies [6], which are generated
through budding of the outer ER membrane [7]. A substantial part of TAG synthesis is performed by enzymes
of the Kennedy pathway, which sequentially transfer
acyl chains from acyl-CoAs to sn-1, -2 and -3 positions

of glycerol backbones [8,9]. DGAT (acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.20) is a transmembrane
enzyme that functions in the final step of TAG biosynthesis, catalyzing the acylation of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) at the sn-3 position using an acyl-CoA
substrate. DGAT has been proposed to be the rate-limiting enzyme in plant storage lipid accumulation [10,11].
Consequently, DGAT is considered a key enzyme for
biotechnological purposes; it might be utilized to
increase oil content in oleaginous plant species [12-15].
DGAT overexpression causes a net increase in seed oil
content in Arabidopsis [16]. Additional evidence is also
available from studies of Glycine max [17], Brassica
napus [18] and Zea mays [19]. TAG can also be formed
by an acyl-CoA-independent pathway. In this pathway,
the phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT;
EC 2.3.1.158) enzyme responsible for TAG synthesis,
using phosphatidylcholine (PC) as the acyl donor, in
which the transfer of an acyl group from the sn-2 position of PC to the sn-3 position of DAG yields TAG and
sn-1 lyso-PC [20-22].
Different types of DGAT enzymes have been identified
in several species. DGAT1 and DGAT2 are two of the
enzymes that are responsible for the main part of TAG
synthesis in most organisms, and they have been studied
in many eukaryotic organisms. Another group of DGAT
enzymes is represented by the bifunctional DGAT/wax
ester synthase (ADP1) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus
[23]. Homologs of ADP1 have also been characterized
in Petunia [24] and Arabidopsis [25]. A soluble form of
DGAT has been identified in peanut cotyledons [26],
and in Euonymus alatus, a distinct type of DGAT was
recently identified that is responsible for the synthesis of
3-acetyl-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerols (acTAG), an unusual
triacylglycerol [27]. The first cloned DGAT gene was
isolated from mice; it corresponds to a member of the
DGAT1 family, which has high sequence similarity with
the sterol:acyl-CoA acyltransferase (ACAT; EC: 2.3.1.26).
DGAT1 is structurally related to the ACATs, with the
divergence in its amino acid sequence conferring its
substrate specificity to DAG. Both enzymes belong to a
large family of membrane-bound O-acyltransferases
(MBOAT) [28,29]. The DGAT2 gene was initially identified in the oleaginous fungus Morteriella ramanniana
[30]. In addition to DGAT2, this family includes acylCoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 EC:2.3.1.22
(MGAT1) [31], MGAT2 [32,33], MGAT3 [34], and acylCoA wax-alcohol acyltransferase (AWAT, EC:2.3.1.75)
[35,36]. Interestingly, DGAT2 enzyme family members
do not show DNA or protein sequence similarities with
DGAT1. Furthermore, DGAT1 proteins are larger than
DGAT2 and possess 6 to 9 transmembrane domains,
while DGAT2 has only one or two [2]. Thus, it has
been suggested that DGAT1 and DGAT2 play non-

Page 2 of 14

redundant roles in different tissues and species in TAG
synthesis [37-40]. Homologs of the DGAT1 and DGAT2
genes have been identified in several eukaryotic organisms [15,30,36,41-49]. A study of comparative genomics
and proteomics in vertebrates suggested that the
DGAT1 and DGAT2 gene families have evolved separately during vertebrate evolution [50]. Despite many
studies of the DGAT1 and DGAT2 gene families, which
emphasize the importance of these enzymes in biotechnology for increasing the accumulation of triacylglycerols [16,51,52], little is known about their evolutionary
origins in eukaryotes apart from vertebrates.
The increasing availability of whole genome sequences
and the annotation of genes from a wide range of phyla
enable deeper phylogenetic analysis of gene families to
provide important contextual insight into their present
day diversity and evolution. The goal of this study was to
examine the evolutionary relationship of the DGAT1 and
DGAT2 genes across eukaryotic organisms in order to
determine their origin and to verify if these genes evolved
separately in eukaryotic organisms. We performed a
comparative analysis integrating phylogenetic, computational and structural approaches to the DGAT1 and
DGAT2 genes, including analysis of their relationship
with the ACAT, MGAT and AWAT genes in a large
number of fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes, representing a broad array of taxonomic groups. Most genomes contain both the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes,
though DGAT1 is absent in yeast and basidiomycetes.
Our findings suggest that these two enzymes evolved
separately since the emergence of eukaryotes and may
have different origins.

Methods
Data sources and sequence retrieving

DGAT1 and DGAT2 gene and protein sequences were
obtained by performing blast searches (blastp, blastx and
tblastx) of the Protein and Genome databases with the
default parameters and an e-value threshold of 1.0 E-50 at
the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information-http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the completed
genome projects database at the JGI (Joint Genome Institute-http://www.jgi.doe.gov). The cDNA sequences encoding DGAT1 and DGAT2 from Arabidopsis (AT2G19450
and AT3G51520) were used as queries in the blastx and
tblastx programs to search for DGAT1 and DGAT2 from
different plant species. The predicted peptides were
further used in blastp analysis to double check their predicted identities. The mouse DGAT1-2 (NM_010046 and
NM_026384), ACAT1-2 (NP_033256 and NP_666176),
MGAT1-2 (NM_026713 and NM_177448) and AWAT1-2
(NM_001081136 and NM_177746) cDNA sequences were
used as queries in the blastx and blastp to search for
homologous sequences. The genome databases of yeast

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/263

http://www.yeastgenome.org/, fungi and insects http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/ were also analyzed using a methodology similar to that described for the plant and vertebrate
sequences. Sequences from representative eukaryotic species belonging to plant monocotyledons (Oryza sativa,
Sorgum bicolor, Brachypodium distachyon), eudicots
(Arabidopsis thaliana, A. lyrata, Brassica napus, Ricinus
comunis, Manihot esculenta, Populus trichocarpa, Prunus
persica, Medicago truncatula, Glycine max, Vitis vinifera,
Cucumis sativus, Mimulus guttatus), mosses (Selaginella
moellendorfii, Physcomitrella patens), microalgae (symbiotic Chlorella sp., free-living Coccomixa sp.), mammals
(Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Bos taurus, Mus musculus,
Rattus norvegicus), bird (Gallus gallus), amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis), fish (Danio rerio), invertebrates (Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster), yeast (Saccharomyces
cereviseae, Candida albicans), fungi (Aspergillus niger,
Alternaria brassicicola, Laccaria bicolor, Schizophylum
commune, Agaricus bisporus) and Amoebozoa (Dictyostelium discoideum) were selected. Additional File 1 provides
a detailed description of the proteins used and the corresponding accession numbers. Taxa terminologies are
abbreviated using the first letter of the genus and two
letters of the species name (e.g., Ath corresponds to Arabidopsis thaliana).
Sequence Alignments

Nucleotide and protein sequences were aligned using the
Alignment Explorer/CLUSTALW [53] implemented in
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA version 4.0) [54]. The multiple alignments were manually
inspected and edited, and only positions unambiguously
aligned were included in the final analysis. The final dataset included a total of 151 sequences from 43 species and
344 amino acid positions. Because the DGAT2 gene was
first identified in the oleaginous fungus Morteriella
ramanniana [30], we also included these sequences in
the analysis. In Tropaeolun majus, DGAT1 seems to be
the sole acyl-CoA-dependent DGAT [15], and this
sequence was included in the analysis. We also included
in this dataset sequences of other types of DGAT
enzymes to compare with DGAT1 and DGAT2, such as
the WSD protein sequence from Arabidopsis [25] and
Acinetobacter sp. [55], soluble DGAT from Arachis hypogaea [26] and a distinct DGAT (DAcT) from Euonimus
alatus [27].
Phylogenetic and structural analyses

The phylogenetic analysis was reconstructed after protein sequence alignments using three different and independent approaches: the neighbor-joining (NJ), the
Bayesian and the Maximum-likelihood (ML) methods.
The NJ method was performed with MEGA 4.0 [54].
The molecular distances of the aligned sequences were

Page 3 of 14

calculated according to the poisson correction model.
All gap and missing data in the alignments were
accounted for by pairwise deletion. Branch points were
tested for significance by bootstrapping with 1000 replications. The ML analysis was performed using
PhyML3.0 [56]. Branch points were tested for significance by bootstrapping with 100 replicates. Bayesian
analysis was conducted in MrBayes 3.1.2 [57] with the
mixed amino acid substitution model plus gamma and
invariant sites. Two independent runs of 10,000,000
generations each with two Metropolis-coupled Monte
Carlo Markov chains (MCMCMC) were run in parallel
(starting each from a random tree). Markov chains were
sampled every 100 generations, and the first 25% of the
trees were discarded as burn-in. The remaining ones
were used to compute the majority rule consensus tree
(MrBayes command allcompat), the posterior probability
of clades and branch lengths. Convergence of the two
runs was assessed by checking the average standard
deviation of split frequencies (below 0.01) and the
Potential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF, very close to
1.00 for all parameters).
The structural organization of the DGAT genes was
determined after alignment of genomic DNA and cDNA
and EST sequences. Genomic sequences were also analyzed in the FGENESH gene structure prediction program
http://www.softberry.com/[58]. Predicted transmembrane
structures were obtained using the transmembrane prediction server TMHMM-2.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
and SMART database http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/
with the complete protein sequences.
Divergence estimates

Pairwise synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka)
numbers of substitutions corrected for multiple hits
were calculated using the DnaSP software (DNA polymorphism analysis) [59].
Cloning and Yeast Complementation

Leaves from Castor bean (Ricinus communis cv.EBDAMPB1) two month-old plants were used for total RNA
extraction using the Nucleospin RNA Plant kit (MachereyNagel) following the manufacturer’s instructions. First
strand cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo(dT) primers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). The
complete open reading frames from castor RcDGAT1
(AY366496) and RcDGAT2 (EU391592) genes were amplified using Pfx50 polymerase (Invitrogen) with the following
primers: 5’-CACCTCTAGAATGACGATTCTCGAAAC
GCC-3’ and 5’-CTCGAGTCAGTTCCCATCGCGATTCATT-3 for RcDGAT1 and 5’-CACCTCTAGAATGGGGGAAGAAGCGAATCA-3’ and 5’-CTCGAGTCAAAGA
ATTTCAAGTGTAAGGTCTGC-3’ for RcDGAT2. XbaI
and XhoI sites added for subsequent manipulations are

underlined. The resulting blunt ended PCR fragments were
cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invtrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. For complementation experiments in yeast, the cloned cDNA fragments were transferred to pVT103-U [53] as XbaI/XhoI inserts, and the
following resulting plasmids were introduced into yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains [60]: are1 are2 mutant
(H1112), and a quadruple mutant strain are1 are2 lro1
dga1 (H1246, kindly donated by Dr. Sten Stymne, Swedish
University of Agricultural Sciences).
Yeast growth and lipid analysis

Single colonies of vector-only, RcDGAT1 or RcDGAT2
transformed yeast in the H1112 and H1246 mutant backgrounds were inoculated in 10 mL of synthetic complete
medium with Ura omitted and grown for 72 h at 28°C.
Cultures were centrifuged for 4 min at 10,000 g. Cell pellets were twice extracted with 1.0 mL of chloroformmethanol solution (10:1, v/v) after intense agitation for
2 min with 0.1 mm glass-beads. The chloroform phase
was collected and evaporated under N2 flow at room temperature. Lipids were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica-gel 60 (TLC Aluminium Sheets,
Merck, Darmstadt) using the hexane/diethyl ether/acetic
acid (90:10:1 v/v) solvent system, which is specific for
resolving neutral lipids [61]. Lipids were revealed after
staining with a 0.03% solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue
R250 (Sigma) in 20% methanol [62]. Triolein, cholesterol
and cholesterol-ester reference lipids, used for TLC, were
all obtained from Sigma.

Results
Identification of DGAT homologous sequences

We have conducted a broad survey of fully sequenced genomes, including representatives of Amoebozoa, yeasts,
fungi algae, mosses, plants (monocots and eudicots), vertebrate (mammalian, fish and amphibian) and invertebrate
(insect), for the presence of DGAT1 and DGAT2 gene
homologs. The full list of genes resulting from this analysis
is summarized in Additional File 1. A set of 36 completely
sequenced and 7 non-sequenced genomes were investigated. A total of 151 sequences were identified, of which
91 were DGATs (DGAT1 and DGAT2), 56 corresponded
to ACAT, MGAT and AWAT and the remaining were
sequences of other types of DGATs. These other DGAT
types include a soluble DGAT from peanut, a distinct
DGAT (DAcT) from Euonymus alatus and a bifunctional
DGAT/wax synthase (WSD) from A. thaliana and Acinetobacter sp.
It was verified that the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes are
almost ubiquitously found in eukaryotes, being readily
identifiable in all the major eukaryotic groups and in all
genomes examined with the notable exception of yeast
(S. cereviseae and Candida albicans) and Basidiomycetes

Page 4 of 14

fungi (Laccaria bicolor, Schizophillum commune and
Agaricus bisporus), which do not contain a DGAT1
gene. Most organisms possess a single copy of each
DGAT gene. The remarkable exception to this general
pattern occurs in some members of green plants, revealing the possible existence of lineage-specific duplications. Homologs to ACAT genes were found in yeast,
fungi, vertebrates (mammalian, fish and amphibian) and
invertebrates (insects) but not in plants. The MGAT
and AWAT genes were found only in vertebrate taxa. In
Amoebozoa species (Dictyostelium discoideum), four
putative DGAT sequences were identified.
Evolutionary relationship of the DGAT gene family in
Eukaryotes

The 151 eukaryote DGAT amino acid sequences and
related ACAT, MGAT and AWAT enzymes were used
for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. A total of
344 positions were included in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses of the DGAT1 and DGAT2 amino acid
sequences resulted in a well-resolved tree. Results from
Bayesian NJ and ML tree analysis produced similar
topologies and revealed evolutionary partitioning of the
DGAT protein family into two major clades: DGAT1
and DGAT2 (Figure 1 and Additional Files 2 and 3).
Vertebrate and invertebrate ACAT1-2 and yeast and
fungi ARE proteins grouped within the DGAT1 clade
(Figure 1 and Additional Files 2 and 3). The MGAT and
AWAT protein grouped into the DGAT2 clade.
Although the ACAT and DGAT1 proteins are closely
related in phylogenetic trees, the ACAT sequences from
yeast, fungi, vertebrates and invertebrates clustered separately from DGAT1 sequences. Interestingly, DGAT2
sequences from vertebrates do not form a monophyletic
group with the DGAT2 homolog sequences from yeast,
fungi, invertebrates and plants. Instead, the DGAT2
sequences from vertebrates appear more closely related
to the vertebrate MGAT2 and AWAT clades, suggesting
that these genes may have arisen from DGAT2 duplication events. Inside both DGAT1 and DGAT2 clades
from plants, monocotyledons and eudicots grouped
separately. Two of the four DGATs sequence homologs
found in Amoebozoa (denominated A and B) grouped
into the DGAT1 and DGAT2 clade, respectively, suggesting that DGAT1 and DGAT2 diverged very early in
eukaryotic evolution. EaDAcT (E. alatus), AtSAT (A.
thaliana), a soluble DGAT from peanut and WSD from
A. thaliana and Acinetobacter sp. grouped separately
from DGAT1 and DGAT2, but with low bootstrap and
posteriori probability values. This result indicates that
these types of DGAT enzymes are phylogenetically
divergent from DGAT1 and DGAT2. Genes encoding
EaDAcT, SAT, WSD and soluble DGAT enzymes have
not yet been identified in other organisms.

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationships between DGAT1 and DGAT2 gene families reconstructed by the Bayesian method. A total of 151
protein sequences from eukaryotic species and 344 sites were included in the analyses. The posteriori probabilities are labeled above the
branches. Only values higher than 0.5 are presented. Numbers within brackets correspond to the number of species within each group. The
enzymes are represented by different colors in the phylogenetic tree: DGAT1 (red), DGAT2 (green), ACATs (purple), MGAT (dark blue) and AWAT
(light blue). Taxa terminologies are abbreviated using the first letter of the genus and two letters of the species name: Alternaria brassicicola
(Abr), Arabidopsis thaliana (Ath), Dictyostelium discoideum (Ddi), Euonymus alatus (Eal), Homo sapiens (Hsa), Mortierella ramanniana (Mra),
Thalassiosira pseudonana (Tps), Xenopus tropicalis (Xtr).

Structural organization and transmembrane domain
prediction

To further investigate the relationships between the
DGAT1 and DGAT2 gene families, we compared the
structural organization of the DGAT genes, when gene
and corresponding cDNA were available. Comparisons
were performed between DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes
from plants and vertebrates (mouse and human). A
detailed comparison of DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes across
plant species and vertebrates (Figure 2) revealed a high
degree of conservation in gene structure within each type
of DGAT (DGAT1 and DGAT2). However, the structure
of the genes encoding the DGAT1 protein is distinct
from that of the DGAT2 gene. The DGAT1 genes harbor
15 to 17 exons, while DGAT2 genes have 8 to 9 exons. In
higher plants, DGAT1 proteins are encoded by genes that
are generally comprised of 16 exons and 15 introns
(Figure 2). An exception to this pattern was observed for
M. esculenta, which probably lost its 7th exon and has

15 exons. The DGAT2 genes are generally comprised of
9 exons, with the exception of Arabidopsis, which has 8.
The vertebrate ACAT has 15 exons, while MGAT has 8
exons. Another important finding was that the structures
of the DGAT1 and ACAT genes are more related to each
other than to the structure of genes encoding DGAT2,
which is more related to the MGAT gene (Figure 2).
Predictions of transmembrane (TrM) structures were
performed, and comparisons were made between plant
DGAT1 and DGAT2 and mouse DGAT1, DGAT2,
ACAT, MGAT and AWAT (Figure 3 and 4). For each
plant DGAT1 subunit examined, 8 and 9 regions containing highly probable TrM sequences were predicted
for monocotyledons and eudicots, respectively. For
DGAT2, only 2 regions containing highly probable TrM
sequences were detected in both monocotyledons and
eudicots (Figure 3). The comparisons among mouse
DGAT1, DGAT2, ACAT, MGAT and AWAT subunits
revealed that DGAT1 is more closely related to ACAT,

which has 8 high probable TrM regions, while DGAT2 is
more closely related to the MGAT and AWAT proteins,
with only 1 TrM region. Interestingly, S. cerevisae acylCoA sterol acyltransferase (coded by the ARE gene)
includes 9 TrM regions, as found in plant DGAT1 and in
mouse DGAT1 and ACAT. Further, S. cereviceae Dga1
(homologue to DGAT2) possesses only one TrM region,
as found in plant DGAT2 and mouse DGAT2, MGAT
and AWAT (Figure 4). Moreover, both ACAT and
DGAT1 proteins have an MBOAT (membrane bound Oacyltransferase) domain (Figure 3 and 4), while DGAT2,
MGAT and AWAT do not. These results support the
hypothesis that DGAT1 and DGAT2 belong to different
gene families and evolved separately during eukaryote
evolution, as is demonstrated by the phylogenetic tree.
Additional Files 4 and 5 show the multiple sequence
alignment of DGAT1 and DGAT2 protein sequences,
respectively. In these alignments, we observed similarities

between DAGT1 and ACAT and DGAT2 with MGAT
and AWAT protein sequences.
Divergence estimates

A comparison of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions (Ka) to the rate of synonymous substitutions (Ks)
was performed; such comparison can be used as an indicator of selective pressure acting on a protein-coding
gene [63,64]. We calculated Ka/Ksratios for vertebrate
DGAT1, DGAT2, ACAT, MGAT and AWAT and for
plant DGAT1 and DGAT2. From these analyses it can
be noted that distinct selective pressures have been
operating on the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes, as different rates were obtained (Additional file 6 and 7). Comparisons between vertebrate DGAT1 and ACAT showed
high Ka/Ksratios, while low Ka/Ksratios were observed
between DGAT2 with MGAT and AWAT from vertebrates (Additional file 6). The comparisons between

revealed a high level of K a /Ks ratios (Additional file 6

DGAT1 was able to reestablish TAG synthesis in the

of lipid amounts among samples was confirmed by the

DGAT1 and DGAT2 and triacylglycerol biosynthesis

Discussion
It has long been understood that DGAT enzymes play
important roles in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. DGAT is
the only enzyme in the pathway that is thought to be
exclusively committed to TAG synthesis, and thus it is
considered a key enzyme in this reaction [10,13,16].

Two different yeast mutants that are defective in TAG
biosynthesis were used to determine if both castor bean
DGAT orthologs are able to complement the mutated
enzymes and allow the synthesis and accumulation of
TAG (Figure 5). TAG synthesis was undetectable in both

DGAT activity was first reported in 1956 [65], but it was
only in the last decade that DGAT genes were cloned
and molecular tools for studying TG synthesis became
available [2]. Although many studies have been conducted with these enzymes, little is known about their
evolutionary origins. Taking advantage of the wide availability of data on the genomes of several species, this
study focused on the characterization of the origin and
evolutionary history of the DGAT1 and DGAT2 gene
families in eukaryotes. Our survey of DGAT1 and DGAT2
proteins shows that they are present in all eukaryotes
searched, with the exception of yeast (Saccharomyces cereviseae and Candida albicans) and basidiomycetes (Laccaria bicolor, Schizophyllum commune and Agaricus
bisporus), which lack DGAT1 (Figure 1 and Additional
Files 1, 2 and 3). This demonstrates that the DGAT1 and
DGAT2 genes encode essential enzymes for most eukaryotic organisms. In the yeast S. cereviseae, two genes that
have homology with DGAT1 were identified, ARE1 and

Figure 6 Scenarios proposed for the evolution of DGAT1 and
DGAT2 in eukaryotes. The proposed evolutionary relationships
between DGAT1 and DGAT2 family members are as follows: DGAT1
and DGAT2 have evolved asymmetrically since the eukaryotic
emergence and underwent convergent evolution likely due to the
importance of TAGs for all eukaryotic organisms.

ARE2, which encode ACAT-related enzymes. The yeast
enzymes are 49 percent identical to each other and exhibit
23 percent identity to human ACAT [66]. Both these
genes have been suggested to be involved in the synthesis
of sterol esters. ARE1 is also involved in the synthesis of
TAG, whereas the ARE2 gene is more specifically involved
in the synthesis of sterol esters [67]. Insights into the functions of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in triglyceride metabolism
have been provided by studies in yeast. With gene knockout or overexpression studies, several groups have demonstrated that the yeast DGA1 (DGAT2 homologue), is the
major DGAT enzyme contributing to triglyceride synthesis
and storage in yeast [60,68,69]. However, it has been
demonstrated with genetic complementation that DGAT1
from Arabidopsis thaliana can restore TAG synthesis to
the yeast dga1:lro1:are1:are2 quadruple mutant, which is
devoid of TAG and sterol esters [70]. In the present work,
using the castor bean genes, we obtained similar results
with DGAT1, and were also unable to demonstrate
DGAT2 ability to complement TAG synthesis compared
to DGAT1, as previously described by Zhang and collaborator’s using DGAT2 from Arabidopsis [70]. This indicates that despite their apparent convergent functional
evolution, DGAT1 and DGAT2 have different affinities for
identical substrates, and their effective activity with accumulation of TAG depends on how much the other
enzymes from the same pathway consume or provide
DGAT substrate and precursors. The absence of DGAT1
genes in yeast and in basidiomycetes indicates that TGAs
are not essential in these organisms and that other
enzymes may be able to produce the required amount of
triacylglycerol. Mutant S. cerevisiae strains devoid of
DGAT activity and lacking triglycerides are viable and
grow normally, indicating that triglycerides are not essential for the survival of this yeast [60]. However, a recent
study showed that triglyceride synthesis is essential for viability of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [71].
Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the existence of
separate clades for DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes in eukaryotes, indicating that they evolved asymmetrically. In the
phylogenetic analysis, DGAT1 was more closely related
and grouped with ACAT genes. ACAT is involved in cholesterol ester biosynthesis in mammals [28], and homologs
of these genes were found in fungi, insects and vertebrates
but not in plants. We verified a conserved motif between
DGAT1 and ACAT (FYXDWWN; amino acids 392-398
of A. thaliana DGAT1) in all organisms analyzed that has
also been reported in other studies [43,72]. This motif has
been implicated in the binding of fatty acyl-CoA, a common substrate for these enzymes [72]. Additionally,
DGAT2 shares homology and groups with acyl-CoA:
monoacylglycerol acyltransferases [31,73]. Topological studies indicated that the majority of DGAT2 is composed of
a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The amino acids

Turchetto-Zolet et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:263
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/263

HPHG make up residues 161-164 of murine DGAT2, suggesting that this sequence plays a crucial role in the function of the enzyme and may be part of the active site [74].
The HPHG-motif is conserved in DGAT2 in yeast, fungi,
invertebrates and vertebrates and is also present in MGAT
and AWAT. Plant DGAT2 contains a corresponding
sequence of conserved amino acids, but the motif is modified to EPHSV (108-112 of A. thaliana DGAT2), which is
conserved in all plant species analyzed. Three DGAT2
homologs were found in the microalgae Chlorella sp.
(chrDGAT2A, chrDGAT2B and chrDGAT2C). In NJ and
ML analysis, chrDGAT2C is more related with vertebrate,
invertebrate, fungi and yeast DGAT2 members and also
with the MGAT and AWAT proteins. chrDGAT2C has
an HPHG motif and chrDGAT2A and chrDGAT2B have
EPHSV motifs, similar to the plant DGAT2. The same
pattern was found in two unicellular photoautotrophic
green algae, Ostreococcus tauri and O. lucimarinus, which
have three DGAT2 genes. One of them shows significant
homology to mammalian MGAT, whereas the other two
seem to be more closely related to plant DGAT2 members
[75]. This suggests that DGAT2 in these organisms may
have evolved by different duplication events.
Notably, the DGAT1 and DGAT2 families arose from
different ancestors during the emergence of eukaryotes,
and our results suggest that they followed convergent
evolution in eukaryotes despite having evolved separately
since the early eukaryotes, as depicted in the model in
Figure 6. The high sequence similarity and close phylogenetic relationship of the DGAT1 and ACAT genes,
which is higher than that of DGAT1 and DGAT2,
strongly suggests that DGAT1 and ACAT emerged from
a common ancestral sequence, whereas DGAT2 emerged
from another ancestral sequence. We propose that the
DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes had a functional convergence
in eukaryotes, which may be explained by the great
importance of DGAT activity to the formation of TAGs
in all eukaryotes. In several species, the formation of
TAGs plays important roles not only as a storage reserve
but also in growth and development. In agreement with
our findings, it has been proposed that the DGAT1 and
DGAT2 enzymes have different biochemical properties
and physiological functions. In overexpression studies in
mice, DGAT2 was identified as a more active enzyme
than DGAT1, yielding a higher increase in intracellular
triacylglycerols that accumulated as large, centrally
located, cytosolic droplets [76]. Mice lacking DGAT1
(Dgat1-/- mice) are viable and have modest reductions in
tissue triacylglycerols [77], whereas mice lacking DGAT2
(Dgat2 -/- mice) have severe reductions in whole body
triacylglycerols and die shortly after birth [76]. In A.
thaliana, mutation of the DGAT1 gene severely affects
seed development, causing the appearance of wrinkled
and incompletely filled seeds, aberrant seedling growth,

Page 10 of 14

reduced seed oil content, an increased DAG/TAG ratio
and the beta-oxidation of elevated fatty acid (FA) levels
[13,15]. It has been also demonstrated that DGAT1, but
not DGAT2, is a multifunctional acyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of diacylglycerol, retinyl esters, and
waxes in addition to triacylglycerol in in vitro assays [78].
DGAT1 cannot compensate for the absence of DGAT2,
highlighting the functional differences between these
enzymes. Furthermore, compared to DGAT1, DGAT2
appears to be more active at lower concentrations of
acyl-CoA (≤ 50 μM) and less active at concentrations
below 50 mM magnesium [38]. The two enzymes may
also differ in terms of substrate specificities. Substrate
specificity assays using a mammalian DGAT2 expressed
in insect cells showed that oleoyl-CoA was utilized preferentially, followed by palmitoyl-CoA, while activity
levels with linoleoyl- and arachidonyl-CoA were similar
[38]. However, in enzymatic assays using soluble and
non-soluble samples of the fungal DGAT2 from M.
ramanniana, no significant preference was detected
between 12:0-CoA and 18:1-CoA as an acyl donor substrate [30]. In plant species, although both DGAT1 and
DGAT2 significantly contribute to TAG formation, the
relative contribution of each enzyme seems to be species
dependent and may also differ in different tissues within
the same plant species [40]. Moreover, it was reported
that DGAT1 and DGAT2 are located in different areas of
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [40]. The fatty acid profile of TAG may be determined by distinct substrate specificities of the DGAT enzymes in different species and
in plants containing unusual fatty acids. DGAT2 may
have a major role in channeling unusual fatty acids into
seed storage oils [15,40]. In a recent study with Ricinus
comunis, it was demonstrated that DGAT2 presents
higher mRNA accumulation than DGAT1 during castor
seed development [79]. It was also demonstrated in R.
comunis that only RcDGAT2 can increase hydroxy fatty
acid levels in transgenic Arabidopsis, while RcDGAT1
cannot [80]. DGAT2 is more likely to play a major role in
seed TAG biosynthesis than DGAT1 in this plant species
[44]. In addition, a study of Vernolic acid in Vernonia
galamensis concluded that both DGAT1 and DGAT2
increase epoxy fatty acid accumulations, but DGAT2 had
a greater effect [81]. All these findings corroborate with
our results that show that DGAT1 and DGAT2, despite
being evolutionarily divergent enzymes, play important
roles in TAG metabolism in all eukaryotic organisms.
Therefore, we conclude that they are very ancient
enzymes that arose quite early in eukaryotic evolution.
The same patterns were observed in structural and
transmembrane analysis. The topology models based on
prediction algorithms suggested that DGAT1 and ACAT
had eight transmembrane domains and 15-17 exons,
whereas DGAT2 had 1 or 2 transmembrane domains and

Turchetto-Zolet et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:263

8 exons, similar to MGAT and AWAT. This reinforced
the idea that despite their ability to catalyze similar reactions, DGAT1 and DGAT2 belong to different gene
families that share neither DNA nor protein sequence
similarity [2]. In addition, topological studies show that
DGAT1 has its N-terminus oriented towards the cytosol
and C-terminal region, which accounts for approximately
50% of the protein, and is present in the ER lumen [82].
Conversely, DGAT2 is an integral membrane protein
with both the N and C termini oriented toward the cytosol [74]. In agreement with our results, a comparative
genomics and proteomics study of vertebrate DGATs
revealed that the predicted secondary and transmembrane (TrM) structures of DGAT1 and DGAT2 were distinct [50]. All of the DGAT2 subunits had one or two
predicted TrM(s), whereas DGAT1 was predicted to have
nine regions with high probability for TrM [50]. In contrast, a recent study about the membrane topology of
murine DGAT1 indicates that DGAT1 has three transmembrane domains [82]. For murine DGAT2, two transmembrane domain were identified [74]. Studies were also
carried out in plants and have shown that Helianthus
annuus [48], Echium [83] and Brassica juncea [43] have
nine transmembrane domains in DGAT1, while DGAT2
from Brassica juncea have two transmembrane domains
[43].
The Ka/Ks ratios for vertebrate DGAT1, DGAT2,
ACAT, MGAT and AWAT and for plant DGAT1 and
DGAT2 showed that distinct selective pressures have
been operating on the DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes. The
comparisons between species groups within of each
DAGT1 and DAGT2 family revealed high Ka/Ks ratios,
while low K a /K s ratios were observed between the
DGAT1 and DGAT2 families. This indicates a purifying
selection within each family with a strong positive selection between them. In the DGAT1 and ACAT genes, in
addition to a high level of similarity between them, a
positive selection has taken place at multiple locations.

Conclusions
Overall, our data show that the DGAT1 and DGAT2
proteins are present in most eukaryotic organisms as
different gene families. Phylogenetic and evolutionary
analyses revealed that DGAT1 and DGAT2 evolved
separately with functional convergence since the emergence of eukaryotes and are widely divergent in molecular and structural aspects.
