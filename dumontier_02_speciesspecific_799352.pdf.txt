Abstract
Background: An organism's ability to adapt to its particular environmental niche is of fundamental
importance to its survival and proliferation. In the largest study of its kind, we sought to identify
and exploit the amino-acid signatures that make species-specific protein adaptation possible across
100 complete genomes.
Results: Environmental niche was determined to be a significant factor in variability from
correspondence analysis using the amino acid composition of over 360,000 predicted open reading
frames (ORFs) from 17 archae, 76 bacteria and 7 eukaryote complete genomes. Additionally, we
found clusters of phylogenetically unrelated archae and bacteria that share similar environments by
amino acid composition clustering. Composition analyses of conservative, domain-based homology
modeling suggested an enrichment of small hydrophobic residues Ala, Gly, Val and charged residues
Asp, Glu, His and Arg across all genomes. However, larger aromatic residues Phe, Trp and Tyr are
reduced in folds, and these results were not affected by low complexity biases. We derived two
simple log-odds scoring functions from ORFs (CG) and folds (CF) for each of the complete
genomes. CF achieved an average cross-validation success rate of 85 ± 8% whereas the CG detected
73 ± 9% species-specific sequences when competing against all other non-redundant CG.
Continuously updated results are available at [http://genome.mshri.on.ca].
Conclusion: Our analysis of amino acid compositions from the complete genomes provides
stronger evidence for species-specific and environmental residue preferences in genomic
sequences as well as in folds. Scoring functions derived from this work will be useful in future
protein engineering experiments and possibly in identifying horizontal transfer events.

Background
An organism may increase its fitness in some range of environmental conditions through evolution. Fundamental
to the survival of cells is the ability to modulate fluctuations in external osmotic and atmospheric pressure, tem-

perature and pH via the acquisition or development of
advantageous molecular mechanisms [1–4]. These mechanisms include the uptake of small molecules, osmolytes
or metals via transporters as found for increased iron uptake allowing enhanced growth of Pasteurella multocida [5]

and in the accumulation of high concentrations of the stabilizing K+ among halophiles [6]. Other mechanisms include modification of the atomic [7] and residue [8]
composition of proteins, or the acquisition of environmental adaptive genes via lateral gene transfer as was likely the case for the thermophilic bacteria Thermotoga
maritima [9] and archaea Solfolobus solfataricus P2 [10]. In
other cases, the gene duplication events augment the ability of an organism to adapt to extreme environments by
expanding specific protein families including additional
stress response and damage control genes that provide increased protection for the radiation resistant bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans [11,12]. Interestingly, in symbionts
such as Buchnera sp. APS [13], Agrobacterium tumefaciens
[14] and Sinorhizobium meliloti [15], shared genetic material may increases overall fitness, but this effectively results in the loss of redundant genes and imposes hostsymbiont dependencies. In other organisms completely
new and innovative mechanisms are required for adapting to the most extreme of environments.
In adaptation to the most extreme environments, it is expected that the protein complement also possesses the organism's adaptive property [6]. For instance,
hyperthermophilic proteins must not only be functional,
but optimized towards the host's extremely hot (>80°C)
physical environment. Although in vivo protection factors
have been identified that can stabilize proteins in vitro at
high temperatures [1] and chaperone proteins can help refold misfolded proteins and prevent aggregation [16–18],
the majority of foreign proteins cloned and expressed in E.
coli retain all of the native enzyme's biochemical properties, including proper folding, thermostability and optimal activity consistent with the organism's optimal
growth temperatures [19–21]. Thus, it is likely that sequence optimizations are required to ensure protein activity and folding in organisms whose growth conditions
might otherwise adversely affect proteins.
Researchers have studied complete or partial genomes using bioinformatics in addition to the traditional comparative sequence-structure and structure-function mutation
studies to identify stability factors. Recent studies of complete or partial genomes have identified sequence-based
correlations between organisms using amino acid compositions. Lobry demonstrated the correlation between G+C
content and codon usage across bacterial sequences [22]
and G+C content and amino acid composition correlations have been extended to 25 complete genomes [8].
Moreover, codon usage and amino acid preferences for
thermophiles are well established and have been extended
to complete genomes [23–26]. However, these generalizations do not necessarily agree with comparative sequencestructure studies. Comparative studies often exploit sequence or structure based alignments to determine simi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/39

larities and differences. Investigation of thermostability
factors across 10 organisms including psychrophiles
(cold-tolerant), mesophiles to hyperthermophiles with
triosephosphate isomerase failed to identify significant
correlations of composition with thermostability [27].
Further uncertainty arises from indications that different
protein families adapt to temperature conditions by different sets of structural mechanisms [28]. How then to
unify amino acid composition preferences with speciesspecific structural adaptations?
Algorithms have been designed to predict certain protein
features primarily from sequence composition including
low complexity regions [29], transmembrane segments
[30], signal peptides [31], coiled-coils [32], secondary
structure elements [33], structural classes [34], hydrophobicity [35], sub-cellular location [36] and have been used
to increase remote sequence similarity searching [37,38].
Moreover, genomic base content has been used to predict
open-reading frames and in-site splicing [39–41]. However, no algorithms have been designed to explore adaptation of proteins to their host environment, especially in a
species-specific manner.
Species-specific adaptive optimizations might be expected
to be subtle and hard to find in any individual sequence,
yet sufficiently common across the bulk of genomic proteins that they may be detected using statistical methods.
We demonstrate here that such subtle adaptive optimizations do exist in many individual organisms and that
these can be extracted. We derive species-specific protein
sequence and fold scoring functions from residue preferences found in predicted open reading frames and conservative structural models. The resulting scoring
functions are effective in amino acid composition speciesspecific protein sequence and fold detection.

Results and Discussion
Principal Components Analysis
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed
with the amino acid compositions of the entire set of protein coding regions from each of the complete genomes
(Figure 1). PCA transforms a number of (possibly) correlated variables into uncorrelated variables called principal
components that account for the variance in the dataset
(see [http://www.statsoftinc.com/textbook/stfacan.html]
for brief overview). The analysis involves plotting the original variables to the principal components (factor loadings) and can be interpreted as correlation coefficients
(Figure 1B,1D). Factor loadings of = 0.6 are considered to
be strong correlations. Simultaneously, a correspondence
of the mean genome amino acid compositions to the
principal components may be observed in order to observe genomic usage or preference that appear to correlated factor loadings (Figure 1A,1C).

The most significant principal component accounted for
47.5% of the variance and showed a strong correlation to
DNA base pair content (94%). The left of this component
corresponds to low GC organisms such as buchnera sp.
(~27%), Mpul (~27%), Bbur (29%), Uure (26%), Wbre
(23%) whereas the right of the component corresponds to
high GC organisms including Mtub (66%), various plant
pathogens (Xanthomonas sp., Mloti), soil bacterium Scoel
(72%) and radiation-resistant Drad (66.6%) (Figure 1A).
Strong correlations also exist between the first component
with several of the factor loadings (Figure 1B). The correlated factor loadings have either [G|C] or [A|T] in the first
two codon positions for some codon. The effect for the
standard codon table is that GC rich codons [C|G] [C|G]
[X] encode amino acids Pro, Arg, Gly, Ala, Trp and GC
poor codons [A|T] [A|T] [X] encoding Phe, Leu, Ile, Asn,
Lys, and Tyr (as well as Met and 2 stop codons). This is in
agreement with a previous report [8]. Consequently, genomic GC content will to a large extent determine amino
acid usage as well as the choosing between small hydrophobic residues Ala/Gly or Ile, positively charged residues
Arg or Lys, and large hydrophobic residues Trp or Tyr/Phe.
The second largest principal component accounts for
15.5% of the variance and appears to correspond to the
environmental niche (Figure 1A). Hyperthermophiles
(Mkan, Paby, Pfur, Phor, Aful, Aaeo, Tmar, Tten, and
Mjan), thermophile Mthe, extreme halophile Halo, thermo-acidophiles (Taci, Tvo, Ssol, Stok), and solventogenic
bacteria (Cace, Cper and Fnucl) correspond strongly to
weakly, respectively, to component 2. Strong correlations
to this component exist for Glu and Val, although opposite correlations exist for Gln, His, Thr, Ser and Cys, thereby suggesting the preferential usage of these amino acids
by those organisms. A discussion regarding amino acid
preferences for hyperthermophiles can be found elsewhere [8]. Eukaryotes (Hsap, Mmus, Scer, Cele and Atha),
with the exception of the obligate intracellular eukaryote
parasite Ecun, have a strong, but opposite correspondence
to component 2. These cluster with chlamydias/chlamydophilas (Cmur, Ctra, Cpne) and the inverse correspondence also indicates a significant increase in the genomic
amino acid usage of Gln, His, Thr, Ser, and Cys, and decrease of Glu or Val. Interestingly, plant pathogens (Xaxon, Xcamp, Mloti, Rsol, Xfas, AtumC and AtumU),
moderate halophiles and alkalophiles (Bsub, Bhal, Linn,
Lact, Lmono, Oihey), and most human pathogens do not
correspond to this component and have an average composition with regards to these amino acids. The distribution of organisms across this component does not appear
to correspond to discrete groupings of organisms that
share similar environmental niches, but rather to a 'continuum of lifestyles' [26]. However, unlike previous studies that report correlations of this second principal
component with growth temperatures [8,26], our results

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/39

seem to indicate that this component is likely to correlate
to a more complex phenomenon that incorporates
growth temperature as well as other physical factors, possibly pH and solvent.
Components 3 and 4 are also significant factors in this
multivariate analysis and these account for 10.3% and
7.4% of the variance. We have not determined a measurable factor that can be directly correlated to these components, but they also appear to correspond to
environmental niche. However, we see species-specific
preferences for Leu, Cys, Asp, Thr, Ser, and to a lesser extent Glu, Gln, His and Met residues (Figure 1D). Component
3
strongly
corresponds
to
several
hyperthermophiles, but inversely corresponds to the extreme halophile Halobacterium, human pathogen Saur,
gastro-intestinal tract colonizer Blong, and moderate halophiles and alkalophiles. Halobacterium's increased Asp
usage is clearly consistent with its adaptation to intracellular and environmental conditions [42], although it differs to the hyperthermophile preference for the larger,
negatively charged Glu. Component 4 has strong correspondence to the eukaryotes (Ecun, Hsap, Mmus, Atha,
Cele) that correlates to Cys and Ser.
Taken together, the results from the principal component
analysis suggest that amino acids that vary significantly
among and between species are due to a large extent to environmental conditions.
Amino acid composition dendrogram
To compare organism amino acid composition, we performed hierarchical clustering using the complete linkage
method with distances computed using the Euclidean
metric on a dataset that consisted of the mean percent
amino acid composition from all predicted open-reading
frames for each of the 100 organisms (Figure 2). This
method generates clusters of organisms with a similar
mean composition across all 20 amino acids that are maximally separated by using the farthest neighbours. The resulting dendrogram presents three large branches within
10 Euclidean difference units. The upper branch clusters
genomes with low GC content (yellow), the mid branch
clusters mid GC genomes and the lower branch clusters
high GC content genomes (green). A feature of clustering
by amino acid composition is that phylogenetically related organisms are not necessarily proximate neighbours.
For instance, Hsap and Mmus are clustered together, but
are separated by a significant distance from Spom, Scer,
Atha and Cele as well as the eukaryote Ecun. Oddly, Ecun
clusters closely to hyperthermophilic archae Aful and
thermophilic Mthe and more distantly to a cluster comprised of hyperthermophilic bacteria Aaeo and Tmar and
archae Paby, Phor and Pfur. However, this organism is not
reported to have thermophilic qualities [43]. In another

Figure 3
Comparison of ORF and Fold composition from complete genomes Amino acid composition from predicted openreading frames (ORF, blue) and fold regions (Fold, red) of Asp (A) and Gln (B) for each complete genome. Bold values indicate
significantly large preferences for (positive) or against (negative) certain residues.

case, hyperthermophiles Aper, Paero and Mkan are clustered together, indicating that organisms that are less phylogenetically related may form tight clusters of organisms
that live in similar environments. These results significantly extend previous composition-based dendrograms
[8], but differ significantly from other attempts to generate genome-based dendrograms [44,45].
Fold residue preferences
In order to address the question of whether the amino
acid composition of ORFs were different that of folds as
well as whether fold composition was species-specific, we
generated over 57,000 conservative domain-based structure models for 95 genomes (see materials and methods).
Amino acid compositions were computed across all protein coding regions for each complete genome using either genomic sequences for a given organism (CG) or fold
(CF) for the purpose of identifying species-specific as well
as pan-specific fold composition bias. Furthermore, excluded indels residues from the modeling exercise comprised <2% of all residues and these exhibited normal
insertion or loop compositions richer in Pro and Gly, but
poorer in the small hydrophobic residues. Figure 3 illustrates one case in which the mean composition of Asp is
unvarying across all genomes, with the single exception of
the extreme halophile Halobacterium. Moreover, we observe a significant increase in Asp residues in the fold regions as compared to the predicted ORF (t-test: p < 10-38).

Figure 3 also illustrates a case in which the mean composition of Gln varies significantly across the genomes. Virtually all genomes show a decrease of Gln (p < 10-11) in
the fold regions, with the startling exception of all thermophiles as well as Cper, Ecun, Halob, Scoel, Buchn, Fnucl and Mmaze. Although the mean composition of Gln is
significantly lower (p < 10-24) in these thermophiles than
the other genomes, the increase of Gln in the fold is a surprising finding given that amidated residues are susceptible to deamidation at high temperatures [46,47].
However, others have reported that polar residues such as
Gln are significantly reduced on the surface of thermophilic intracellular proteins as compared to their mesophilic counterparts, likely reducing the possibility of
damaging deamidation reactions [48].
We found that small hydrophobic residues Ala, Gly and
Val as well as charged residues Asp, Glu, His and Arg are
consistently increased in the fold regions across all organisms (Figure 4). Furthermore, we observed a significant
decrease of amidated residues Asn and Gln as well as larger aromatic residues Phe, Trp, and Tyr, as well as Leu and
Ser in the fold regions. It is possible that smaller residues
in fold regions allow better packing of the core whereas
charged residues are utilized for stabilizing electrostatic
interactions including salt bridges. In order to exclude the
possibility that our results may be biased due to low compositional complexity of ORF or fold regions, we applied

Species-specific genome and fold composition scoring functions Species-specific genome (CG) and fold (CF)
composition scoring functions derived from the amino acid
composition of all predicted ORFs or modeled fold regions,
respectively, from the complete genomes of E. coli, M. jannaschii and Halobacterium. See text for reference to values in
bold.

templates are obtained via crystallography experiments,
we cannot rule out the possibility that the fold composition bias may reflect a composition that is more amenable
to crystallographic structure determination.
Composition-based scoring unctions
Since there exists significant amino acid variability between protein sequences from different organisms, we
sought to generate a scoring function that would allow
species-specific identification of protein sequences. Two
scoring functions indicating the log probability of amino
acid occurrence were generated for each organism. The
first scoring function, CG, is based on genomic composition and was derived by taking the log of the amino acid
frequency across all genomic ORFs for the given organism
over the average amino acid frequency of all the genomes.
The second scoring function, CF, was generated from fold
composition of the aligned sequences and was derived by
taking the log of the amino acid frequencies from the
aligned residues of the genomic sequence divided by the
template residues. In this fashion the reference state for
these scoring functions is what we have termed the 'random organism' since it represents a collection of amino
acid compositions from a variety of organisms. This then

provides the noise of the scoring function from which we
are trying to extract a meaningful, species-specific signal.
Log-odds potentials of protein substructures are considered additive [49], and in the evaluation of a sequence,
the overall score for a sequence is calculated from the sum
of the species-specific log-odds scores for each of its residues.
The nature of these scoring functions is such that if the
composition of the organism is not particularly different
than the 'random organism', then the magnitude of the
scoring function values will approach 0. For instance, the
magnitude of the Ecoli CG and CF scoring functions values
are typically less than either the Mjan or Halob (Figure 5).
The CG and CF scoring functions are fairly similar and correlate well (86 ± 13%) with each other across all genomes.
Mjan has a strong preference for Ile and Lys, but not Gln
or Ala largely due to the amino acid coding due to the GC
content of the genome (see PCA section). In contrast,
Halob prefers the small hydrophobic Ala residue and the
charged Asp residue, but not the amidated Asn nor the
positively charged Lys. Thus, these scoring functions reflect the probability of observing any residue in a protein
sequence or fold for some genome and are heavily influenced by the GC content of the genome and its residuebased environmental adaptations.
Cross-validation
As a preliminary test, we evaluated the performance of the
CF scoring functions for their ability to detect folds in a
species-specific manner. That is, the successful scoring
function should identify fold sequences of the parent taxonomy from which the scoring function was derived. The
performance of the scoring function was evaluated via a
jackknife method in which 10% of the model-template
pairs were excluded in generating the scoring function.
These excluded pairs were then scored with the exclusive
scoring function and success was achieved when the score
obtained from the model fold was greater than the template fold. The binary species detection ability of the CF
scoring functions to select between the model over the
template ranged from 65% to 99% with an average of 85
± 8% of model sequences being detected from the speciesspecific fold database (random = 50%). The best CF detections (>95%) were made with scoring functions derived
from those organism found to vary the most in composition including Mpul (99.4%), Buch, Bbur, Halob, Hpylo,
Mjan, Mgen, Uure (96.2%). In contrast, the poorest CF detections were made by common bacteria and pathogen
scoring functions from Ecoli variants, Cele, Hsap, Nmeni
and Sent. The poor results from these scoring functions reflect the similar model-template composition. In fact, the
Ecoli variants obtained ~50% of their template structures
from E. coli, Cele obtained ~40% of template structures
from human, Hsap obtained ~25% of its structures from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/39

mouse and 15% from rat and Mmus obtained 46% of
template structures from human. The exclusion, or at least
the limit of these structure templates would increase the
difference in model-template composition and likely generate a more useful scoring function. Thus, these results
indicate the admirable species-specific detection ability of
the CF scoring functions on short species-specific domain
sequences. Cross-validation was not performed for the CG
scoring functions.
Prediction set
We used all 100 CG and 95 CF scoring functions to score
every predicted protein sequence from all complete genomes in order to evaluate species-specificity (see Figure
9 (Table 1). The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate
the scoring function effectiveness in identifying proteins
from the parent organism. Log odd scores were obtained
for each protein from each of the complete genomes as
evaluated by each of the scoring functions. We also recorded the overall average score obtained by each scoring
function across all the ORFs in the genome. In doing so,
we discovered that the self-scoring function invariably obtained the lowest overall score (data not shown). The random probability that a scoring function will obtain the
best score is determined by the number of best scores included over the total number of scoring functions (i.e. for
CG 10/100 for the top 10 scoring functions using a total of
100 scoring functions) and we can find the maximum value as the difference between the observed success rate and
the random probability (Figure 6). We find that the maximum success rate occurs when >20 CG scoring results are
considered. However, as a more conservative estimate,
one may choose to consider at least the top 5–10 scoring
results to overcome the fact that similar scoring functions
obtained by effectively redundant genomes will split the
number of successful detections. For instance, scoring
functions derived from E. coli strains and compositionally
similar species (Sent and Styp and their variants) obtained
comparable scores, which prevented effective detection of
E. coli sequences by any of E. coli scoring functions when
only the top score was considered a detection success. The
effect of increasing the number of best scores included
from 1 to 5, 10 and 15 can be seen for all scoring functions
in Figure 7. The ability of the CG scoring functions to identify proteins from the parent organism when considering
the top 15 scoring results ranged from 51% (EcoliE) to
87% (Paby) with an average 73 ± 9% success. The most effective scoring functions were derived from the low GC organism
(Wbre,
Buch,
Bbur,
Baphi,
Mpul),
hyperthermophiles, Halob and several high GC organisms (Ccres, Mtub, Mtub, Scoel, Smel). When including
the top 5 scoring results, the success rate decreased to 49
± 17%. Note the success rate is significantly higher than
random (15/100 or 15%, 5/100 or 5%). In contrast, the
effectiveness of the CF scoring functions varied more

across this dataset, ranging from a low of 2% (Cele) to a
high of 92% (Mpul) with an average success rate of 55 ±
24% when using the top 15 scores, which decreases to 40
± 25% when only including the top 5. The most successful
scoring functions were derived primarily from GC or AT
rich organisms. Taken together, the most successful composition-based scoring functions were those derived by
organisms with significant composition bias either as a result of %GC skew or from a more extreme environmental
niche such as is the case for hyperthermophiles, thermophiles and halophiles. Finally, these results indicate
that amino acid composition-based scoring functions
may be able to identify the taxonomic origin of protein sequences.

Conclusions
In the largest study of its kind, we have identified speciesspecific amino acid composition differences across the
predicted open-reading frames of 100 complete genomes.
Continuously updated results are available at [http://genome.mshri.on.ca]. Our principal components analysis
supports the idea that environmental niche is a major factor for the amino acid composition differences found between species. However, our results raise the possibility
that this principal component corresponds more to a
complex mixture of environmental influences such as pH,
pressure, salt and solute concentrations and to some lesser
extent, growth temperature [8,26].

CG Scoring Function

Figure 7
Effect of increasing number of top scores included for detection success with 100 CG scoring functions Detection rate increases for increased the number of included scores. Note that certain scoring functions naturally have a high success rate when just considering the top score (Halo, Ecun, MkanA), but others (EcolE, EcolO, Ecol) are redundant and do not
necessarily obtain the top score. The former change little when including the top 5, 10 or 15 scores, but the latter largely benefit from this inclusion.

We observed an increased preference for small hydrophobic and charged residue over larger aromatic residues
across all species after conservatively modeling 57,840
folds. Moreover, these fold composition biases also illustrate species-specific residue preferences. These biases provided an opportunity for the first time to derive and test
simple yet effective species-specific scoring functions. We
found that the fold scoring functions are 85 ± 8% effective
in detecting a species-specific fold sequence. Moreover, we
found that the genomic composition scoring function
successfully identified sequences from its parent organism
with a surprising 73 ± 9% overall accuracy.
The species-specific composition bias suggests that the
variable amino acids are available for structural and/or
environmental optimization aspects of proteins. We are
currently investigating the usefulness of the species-specific composition-based scoring functions in identifying variable composition regions of protein structures and
whether they correspond to structural/functional regions.
We are also investigating the possibility of using these

scoring functions to find proteins that are non-native to
an organism, possibly indicating horizontal transfer. Scoring functions derived from this work can be used in future
species-specific protein and fold identification and sequence optimization experiments.

Methods
Non-redundant protein sequences determined from each
of the complete genomes (Table 1) was obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI –
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]) [50] via SeqHound, our
integrated sequence and structure database manager [51]
[http://seqhound.mshri.on.ca]. Amino acid compositions
were computed using all protein coding regions for each
complete genome by software developed in our laboratory. Principal components analysis and the amino acid
composition dendrogram were generated using the SPLUS statistics package. Two-tailed paired t-tests were performed to test the null hypothesis that the ORF vs fold
mean compositions for each amino acid were the same.
All applications were written in ANSI C using the cross-

is aligned to a homologous sequence with a 3D structure (STR) using a secondary structure profile using ClustalW. Note the
insertion of gaps (denoted by -, red) in non-structured regions of the 3D structure. In the MERGE step, gaps in the structure
are masked out, and eliminated in the compression step (COMP). At this point, the number of identical residues and the
number of residues in the genomic sequence occupying a domain position in the structure are counted. Since domain 1 alignment passes the minimal 25% identity and 75% occupancy, it is used for further analysis. However, the %identity in the domain

Conservative fold modeling
Domains are the fundamental unit of a polypeptide chain
or part of a polypeptide chain that are thought to independently fold into a stable tertiary structure. Since domains are often units of function and different domains of
a protein are often associated with different functions, we
evaluated sequence alignments on a structural domainby-domain basis rather than by the global alignment. This
provides a conservative framework to evaluate structural
alignments.

Sequence and structure
For each protein sequence from a completely sequenced
and annotated genome, herein referred to as a genomic sequence, we identified neighbour sequences, that is, sequences in the non-redundant protein sequence database
sharing significant levels of similarity (expect value <
0.01) using NBLAST, a cluster-computer variant of BLAST
[52] (Table 1). No efforts were made to minimize a possible bias contributed by paralogous genomic sequences.
Neighbour sequences with 3D structures, herein referred
to as templates, were identified using SeqHound [51], in
a similar fashion to the NCBI's genome annotation service
[53]. These genomic sequences and their corresponding
templates are then used to generate hi-fidelity sequence to
structure alignments.

Hi-fidelity sequence to structure alignment
We modified the ClustalW software package [54] to initiate a global alignment of two neighbour sequences using
the PAM series substitution matrices and apply position
specific gap penalties by virtue of a secondary structure
profile. The profile is derived from the structure's annotation information provided by the authors of the published structure as well as from NCBI's vector alignment
search tool, VAST [55]. A greater weight is placed when the
two sources agree, and this effectively forces gaps into unstructured regions lacking alpha helices and beta strands.
To create conservative, fold-based alignments, gaps that
were added to the genomic sequence are masked out since
there is no correspondence to the structure and gaps inserted into the structure template to accommodate query
insertions are eliminated (Figure 8). This gap-handling
procedure had no visible effect on composition analyses
that are later described.

To reject poor alignments and enhance the fidelity of the
global alignment, both the sequence identity and structural position occupancy are determined over each VASTidentified structural domain. Various threshold levels
were tested, although an alignment sequence identity of
25% and domain occupancy of 75% was found to provide
optimal compromise between sensitivity and specificity
(data not shown). If less than 25% of the aligned residues
are identical and less than 75% of the aligned residues occupy residue positions in the domain, the domain is
masked out completely and not used in any further computations (Figure 8). These selection criteria generate relevant domain homologues and provide the ability to
discriminate subtle sequence changes that are independent of fold in a statistically observable manner. When an
alignment across a domain is found to satisfy the minimum constraints specified above, a structural model is
generated for the genomic sequence by virtue of a sequence-to-structure alignment, herein referred to as the
model.
Since a genomic sequence may make many models using
different templates, only the single best model is selected
to minimize sampling bias. The selection criterion emphasizes the use of multi-domain structural models by using a scoring function derived from residue length of the
non-masked out aligned domain region(s), the fraction of
residues that are identical and the fraction of residues occupying domain positions. The model with the best score
is then selected to represent that genomic sequence.
For each representative model, the sequence alignments
between the genomic sequence and the template, along
with the corresponding secondary structure are written to
a database, herein known as the species-specific fold database. This fold database is the source of model and tem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/39

plate sequences for determining fold composition and
deriving species-specific fold scoring functions.
Model quality
Our method exploits species-specific optimizations at the
sequence level by making accurate structural-based alignment for genomic sequences. We generated models for 95
of the 100 genomes with 5 genomes having been very recent additions. Initially, there are as many 3D neighbours
as genomic sequences (Table 1). However, 24 ± 10% of
genomic sequences make structural models and only 19 ±
6% settle with a single representative model structure that
pass our structural domain alignment criteria. The representative models are 168 ± 10 residues in length and possess 41 ± 5% sequence identity and 96.7 ± 0.3% domain
occupancy with the template structure, which is clearly
higher than our set minimum requirements. Furthermore,
template structures are used 1.4 ± 0.4 times for model
building, thereby minimizing structure over-sampling
and providing more unique templates. Interestingly, at
least 36 to as many as 287 different organisms contribute
5.8 ± 3.5 template structures to each genome modeling exercise. 30 ± 12% of the templates are obtained from E. coli
and 23 ± 9% of structures are obtained from thermophilic
species. Our models hold properties of 'good' models
since they are based on at least 30% sequence identity are
shorter than 200 residues and are aligned along template
domains, in agreement with other published criteria [56].

In general, the number of final models generated for complete genomes reported elsewhere is greater than the
number generated with our method. For example, the
NCBI provides a substantially larger set of 3D structure
neighbours for complete genomes, in which as many as
39% of sequences are reported to have structure neighbours [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/
PDB_bact.html]. ModBase has on average between 2 to 4
models per sequence in which they claim roughly 44% are
reliable [http://pipe.rockefeller.edu/modbase]. Since our
comparative modeling method is more conservative in
that it does not attempt to model side-chains, loops, or regions with no template and our alignments are evaluated
over smaller, domain-focused regions, we expect fewer errors [57].

Authors' contributions
KM provided the framework for complete genome analysis with her development of the SeqHound sequence and
structure database management system. MD carried out
the statistical analysis, derived and tested the scoring functions and drafted the manuscript. MD and CWVH jointly
conceived of the study, and participated in its design and
coordination.
