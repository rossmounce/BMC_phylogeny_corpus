Abstract
Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is divided into a European and North
American genotype. East European PRRSV isolates have been found to be of the European genotype, but form different
subtypes. In the present study, PRRSV was isolated from a Belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure and
designated "Lena". Analyses revealed that Lena is a new East European subtype 3 PRRSV isolate. The main purpose of
this investigation was to study the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of PRRSV (Lena).
Results: Obvious clinical and virological differences were observed between the animals inoculated with a recent
European subtype 1 PRRSV isolate (Belgium A) and animals inoculated with PRRSV (Lena). Three out of six pigs
inoculated with PRRSV (Belgium A) had anorexia and low fever at 3, 4 and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi). High fever,
anorexia and depression were prominent signs in most pigs inoculated with PRRSV (Lena) between 2 and 28 dpi. Four
pigs out of ten died during the experiment. Arcanobacterium pyogenes was isolated from lungs of one animal that died,
and Streptococcus suis was isolated from lungs of one animal that was euthanized. The difference in viral titres in sera
from PRRSV (Belgium A) and PRRSV (Lena)-infected pigs was statistically significant (p < 0.05) at 7, 10, 14 and 21 dpi. The
highest viral titres in sera ranged from 104.8 to 106.1 TCID50/ml for PRRSV (Lena) whereas they ranged from 103.1 to 104.8
TCID50/ml for PRRSV (Belgium A).
The replication of PRRSV (Lena) was further studied in depth. Viral titres ranged from 102.5 TCID50/100 mg to 105.6
TCID50/100 mg in nasal secretions between 3 and 14 dpi and from 102.8 TCID50/100 mg to 104.6 TCID50/100 mg in
tonsillar scrapings between 3 and 21 dpi. High viral titres were detected in lungs (102.3-107.7 TCID50/g tissue), tonsils
(102.0-106.2 TCID50/g tissue) and inguinal lymph nodes (102.2-106.6 TCID50/g tissue) until 35, 28 and 35 dpi, respectively.
To examine the antigenic heterogeneity between the East European subtype 3 isolate Lena, the European subtype 1
strain Lelystad and the North American strain US5, sets of monospecific polyclonal antisera were tested in
immunoperoxidase monolayer assays (IPMAs) with homologous and heterologous viral antigens. Heterologous
antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres (p = 0.01-0.03) for antisera against PRRSV (Lena) at all
sampling time points. For antisera against PRRSV (Lelystad) and PRRSV (US5), heterologous antibody titres were
significantly lower than homologous titres at 14 and 21 dpi (p = 0.01-0.03) and at 10 and 14 dpi (p = 0.04), respectively.
Conclusions: Lena is a highly pathogenic East European subtype 3 PRRSV, which differs from European subtype 1
Lelystad and North American US5 strains at both the genetic and antigenic level.

Background
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV) is a causative agent of reproductive failure in
sows and respiratory disorders in pigs and had been
firstly recognized in the USA in 1987 [1] and subsequently in Europe in the early 1990s [2]. The PRRSV
genome contains nine open reading frames (ORFs) [3].
The ORF1a and ORF1ab code for proteins with apparent
replicase and polymerase activities. Four minor structural
proteins GP2, E, GP3 and GP4 are encoded by ORF2a,
ORF2b, ORF3 and ORF4, respectively [3-5]. The major
structural proteins are an envelope glycoprotein (GP5),
an unglycosylated membrane protein (M) and a nucleocapsid (N) protein, encoded by ORFs 5, 6 and 7, respectively. PRRSV shows a high degree of genetic variation
[6,7] and some antigenic heterogeneity [8-10]. Based on
genetic and antigenic characteristics, PRRSV is divided
into a European and North American genotype [11].
Recently, ORF5 and ORF7 sequences of East European
PRRSV isolates were found to be of the European genotype, but group separately from all other European genotype sequences [12,13]. Stadejek and colleagues proposed
a division of the European genotype into three subtypes: a
pan European subtype 1 and East European subtypes 2
and 3 [13]. To our best knowledge, there is no information available concerning the pathogenesis of recent East
European PRRSV isolates. Antigenic heterogeneity
between European and North American PRRSV strains
had been described earlier [8-10], however this issue
remains to be determined towards new East European
PRRSV subtypes.
The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of a
recently isolated East European subtype 3 PRRSV isolate.
Results
Sequence information

The nucleotide sequences of ORF2a, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and
deduced aa (amino acid) sequences were determined for
the Belarusian PRRSV Lena (GenBank: EU909689,
EU909690, EU909691, EU909692, EU909693) and North
American PRRSV US5 (except ORF2a) (GenBank:
EU926971, EU926972, EU926973, EU926974). All
sequences were compared to the European reference
strain Lelystad and the North American reference strain
VR-2332 (Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
Lena is a new East European subtype 3 PRRSV isolate.
Compared to previously described subtype 3 Belarusian
isolates [12,13], PRRSV (Lena) showed between 87-96%
and 90-98% identity for the GP5 and N proteins, respectively. The Lena GP2, GP4, GP5, M and N proteins were
249, 184, 201, 173 and 124 aa long. PRRSV (Lena) as well
as other previously described subtype 3 Belarusian iso-

lates had the lowest N protein size for the European genotype and the largest GP4 protein reported so far.
Clinical findings

Obvious clinical differences were observed between the
animals inoculated with PRRSV (Lena) and the animals
inoculated with PRRSV (Belgium A). PRRSV (Lena)inoculated pigs showed a rapid disease evolution.
Anorexia and depression were seen in all animals from 5
to 18 dpi and periocular edema was observed from 3 to 9
dpi. Body temperature and respiratory disease scores are
summarized in Figure 1. At 2 dpi, seven pigs out of ten
had already fever which lasted until 28 dpi ranging from
40 to 42.1°C. Coughing was observed in some animals
from 6 to 24 dpi. Four pigs died during the experiment;
one at 4, one at 20 and two at 21 dpi. Out of six pigs inoculated with PRRSV (Belgium A), only three animals
showed anorexia and fever (40°C) at 3, 4 and 5 dpi. Afterwards, temperature returned to normal, animals recovered and stayed healthy and alive until the end of the
experiment. Respiratory disorders were not observed in
these pigs.
Gross lesions, bacteriology and differential diagnosis

The results of the postmortem and bacteriological examinations of pigs inoculated with PRRSV (Lena) are presented in Table 2. Arcanobacterium pyogenes was isolated
from lungs of one animal that died, and Streptococcus suis
was isolated from lungs of one animal that was euthanized. All pigs were negative for porcine circovirus 2,
influenza virus, parvovirus and enteroviruses.
Viremia

Viral titres in sera of PRRSV (Lena)-inoculated animals
were first detected at 3 dpi in nine pigs out of 10. At 7 dpi,
all pigs had viremia which lasted until 28 dpi (Figure 2).
The viral load in sera reached peak levels ranging from
104.0 to 106.1 TCID50/ml at 10 dpi and 104.3 to 106.0
TCID50/ml at 14 dpi. A high viremia was observed until
28 dpi. In pigs inoculated with PRRSV (Belgium A), viremia was detected from 3 dpi until 21 dpi. At 28 dpi only
one pig out of six was still viremic with low viral titre
(101.6 TCID50/ml). The viral titres in this group were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in PRRSV (Lena)-inoculated animals at 7, 10, 14 and 21 dpi.
PRRSV titres in different samples

PRRSV (Lena) was detected in nasal swabs from 3 dpi
until 14 dpi and viral titres ranged from 102.5 TCID50/100
mg to 105.6 TCID50/100 mg. Tonsillar scrapings collected
from all seven animals at 3 dpi had PRRSV titres ranging
from 102.8 TCID50/100 mg to 104.6 TCID50/100 mg. At 14
dpi, five samples out of seven were positive with viral

titres between 102.3 TCID50/100 mg and 103.6 TCID50/100
mg. At 21 dpi, three tonsillar scrapings out of five were
PRRSV positive with viral titres ranging from 102.5
TCID50/100 mg to 103.1 TCID50/100 mg.
The results of virus titration of BAL (bronchoalveolar
lavage) fluids and PAMs (porcine alveolar macrophages)
are represented in Table 3. High viral titres were already
detected in BALs and PAMs at 3 dpi. All BAL fluids and
PAM samples were positive until 21 dpi. At 28 dpi, PAMs
from only one pig were positive.
High viral titres were detected in lungs (102.3-107.7
TCID50/g tissue), tonsils (102.0-106.2 TCID50/g tissue) and
inguinal lymph nodes (102.2-106.6 TCID50/g tissue) until
35, 28 and 35 dpi, respectively.
Serology (IPMA results)

All animals were serologicaly negative prior to inoculation and at 0 and 3 dpi. Six out of nine PRRSV (Lena)inoculated pigs seroconverted at 7 dpi and antibody titres
ranged from 1.7 to 4.7 log4. From 10 dpi until the end of

experiment all pigs were seropositive with antibody titres
ranging from 4.7 to 7.7 log4. In animals inoculated with
PRRSV (Belgium A), the course of anti-PRRSV antibody
titres did not significantly differ from that in PRRSV
(Lena)-inoculated pigs.
Serological cross-reaction (IPMA results)

All samples collected at 0 and 3 dpi were seronegative
regardless of the PRRSV used (Figure 3). Three PRRSV
(Lelystad)-inoculated pigs out of ten seroconverted at 7
dpi and seven more at 10 dpi. All seven pigs inoculated
with the PRRSV (US5) were seropositive at 7 dpi. The
overall difference among the homologous antibody titres
of the three groups was not significant (p = 0.1). All sera
which were negative in the IPMA with homologous antigens were also negative in the IPMA with heterologous
antigens. Heterologous antibody titres were significantly
lower than homologous titres (p = 0.01-0.03) for antisera
against PRRSV (Lena) at all sampling time points. For
antisera against PRRSV (Lelystad) and PRRSV (US5), heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than

Discussion
In the present study, PRRSV was isolated from a Belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure. It was
designated Lena. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that
PRRSV (Lena) is a new East European subtype 3 PRRSV
isolate. The main purpose of this investigation was to
study the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of
PRRSV (Lena).
To study the pathogenesis, ten 6-week-old conventional
pigs were inoculated with PRRSV (Lena). A fever, lasting
for several weeks, and a range of respiratory and systemic
clinical signs together with gross lesions such as severe
fibrinous pleuropneumonia, pericarditis and peritonitis
were observed, with four out of ten animals dying within
three weeks post-inoculation. The clinical and pathological picture and high mortality are similar to what is seen

in the field in Belarus (information from local veterinarians). A comparison of the findings obtained with PRRSV
(Lena) with those obtained with other PRRSV strains
revealed similarities with some highly pathogenic American strains [14]. Fever, prolonged viremia and co-infection with bacterial pathogens are prominent findings
common to all of them. In this study, the viremia lasted
for 4 weeks. As previously described for other PRRSV
strains [15], antibodies produced early in infection were
not effective in virus clearance. A good correlation was
found between the extent of viremia and viral titres in
nasal and tonsillar secretions and tissues.
The highest PRRSV (Lena) titres in sera in our investigation ranged from 104.8 to 106.1 TCID50/ml at different
dpi. In the present study (European subtype 1 PRRSV isolate Belgium A) and in most previous studies, the highest
PRRSV titres ranged from 103.6 to 104.8TCID50/ml. To our
knowledge, only few PRRSV strains had been reported to

cause abnormally high viremia (105.2-106.0 TCID50/ml)
[16-19]. However, the animals used in those studies were
younger (15-35 days of age) than in present experiment
and in most studies only a small number of pigs had high
PRRSV titres. Two younger pigs (four weeks of age)
which were inoculated with PRRSV (Lena) had also
higher viral titres in sera, 105.8 and 107.8 TCID50/ml (data
not shown).
The severity of the observed clinical signs is most probably not due to a single direct effect of PRRSV (Lena).
Secondary infections with other pathogens will have
played an important role in the exacerbation of clinical
signs. Indeed, in the present study Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Streptococcus suis were isolated from lungs of

two pigs. It seems that PRRSV (Lena) infection paves the
way for other pathogens. Co-infections of certain PRRSV
strains with Arcanobacterium pyogenes as well as Streptococcus suis had been shown to increase the severity of the
disease in pigs [14,20]. Damaging local respiratory macrophages potentially negatively affects the immune
defense and allows bacteria to grow and to cause pathology and disease [21]. Pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) are thought to be very important in the
clearance of circulating blood-borne bacteria in pigs [22].
The detrimental effects of PRRSV on PIMs have been
demonstrated before and are considered as factors for the
increased susceptibility to secondary infections [23-26].
The severity of disease caused by PRRSV (Lena) as a single agent should be verified in gnotobiotics.
The appearance of new highly virulent PRRSV strains
and absence of effective diagnostic procedures and vaccines create a favorable environment for the emergence of
devastating outbreaks. Pivotal examples are the recent
atypical PRRSV outbreaks in China and Vietnam [27].
Sensitive and specific serological tests are important tools
to control PRRSV. To characterize the antigenic heterogeneity between East European subtype 3 Lena, European
subtype 1 Lelystad and North American US5 strains, sets
of antisera were tested in IPMAs with homologous or
heterologous viruses as antigens. Although the three sets
of antisera reacted with all strains, the homologous antibody titres were always higher than the heterologous
ones. The antigenic difference between the reference
European strain Lelystad and Lena was similar to that
between Lelystad and US5. Thus, East European subtype
3 Lena, European subtype 1 Lelystad and North American US5 PRRSV strains do share common antigenic
determinants that induce production of antibodies reac-

tive with the heterologous strains, but there are clear
antigenic differences.
Since all present commercial kits for serological diagnosis are based on antigens belonging to European subtype 1 and North American PRRSV, it can be assumed
that the observed heterogeneity might affect the accuracy
of serological assays in geographical regions where East
European Subtype 3 PRRSV strains circulate. Therefore,
it is of major importance to validate the sensitivity of the
current methods for serological PRRSV diagnosis in these
regions.

Conclusions
Lena is a highly pathogenic East European subtype 3
PRRSV, which differs from European subtype 1 Lelystad
and North American US5 strains at both the genetic and
antigenic level.

Methods
Virus isolation

Samples were collected from a nucleus herd of 5000 sows
from the Eastern part of Belarus in January 2007. The
herd experienced the following problems: abortion, birth
of mummified, dead and weak piglets, high mortality rate
before weaning, respiratory disorders and mortality (up
to 70%) in growing pigs. The herd had been confirmed to
be PRRSV positive. Also bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli) were regularly found in pigs
with respiratory disorders. The lungs from weak-born
piglets were collected for virus isolation. PAMs were
obtained as previously described [28] from 4- to 6-weekold conventional Belgian Landrace pigs from a PRRSVnegative herd. PAMs were cultivated in RPMI 1640 modified medium (Gibco Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine (BDH

Chemicals Ltd.), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco
Invitrogen), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco Invitrogen),
and a mixture of antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO2
atmosphere at 37°C. Subsequently, PAMs were inoculated with 20% suspensions of the lungs, CPE was
observed and cells were fixed for 10 minutes with methanol (100%) at -20°C. The virus was identified by incubation with PRRSV-specific monoclonal antibodies P3/27
against the nucleocapsid protein [10] as previously
described [29]. Then, the Belarusian isolate, designated
Lena was grown in gnotobiotic macrophages and used for
sequencing and the pathogenesis study. The virus stock
was free from bacteria, pseudorabies virus, classical
swine fever virus, parvovirus, enteroviruses and circoviruses.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Protect Mini Kit
(QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Total RNA was used as template in reverse transcription
PCR with reverse transcriptase and random hexamer
primers (Invitrogen) at 60°C annealing temperature and
the cycling conditions were used as described by the
manufacturer. PCR products were treated with Exonuclease I and Antarctic Phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and used directly for cycle sequencing with a Big
Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing Kit V1.1 (Applied Biosystem) and PRRSV primers. Primers were designed
based on the alignment of the genome sequences of
strains BJ4, MLV, P129, VR2332 and Lelystad (GenBank:
AF331831, EF484033, AF494042, EF442771, M96262,
respectively). The primers are listed in Table 4. Cycle
sequencing reaction products were purified by ethanol
precipitation and separated on an ABI Genetic 310

(Applied Biosystem). In addition, the PCR products were
electrophoresed on 5% agarose gels. PCR fragments of
the correct size were cut out of the gel and purified using
a QiaQuick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). The purified
fragments were sequenced as described above.

Adaptation of the PRRSV (Lena) isolate on MARC-145 cells

The use of PAMs in an IPMA for the detection of PRRSV
antibodies in sera is difficult and expensive since cells
have to be harvested from young pigs (preferably specific
pathogen free animals). Certain monkey kidney cell lines
(MA-104; MARC-145) can be a replacement for macrophages, but such cell lines do not support the growth of
all isolates, particularly European ones. In order to get
high virus replication in pigs and generate PRRSV (Lena)
quasispecies which might favorably contribute to the
adaptation on MARC-145 cells, two 4-week-old piglets
from a PRRSV-negative farm were inoculated oronasally
with 105 TCID50/pig of macrophage-grown virus. At 9
dpi, the pigs were euthanized and sera, lungs and tonsils
were collected. Incubation of MARC-145 cells with suspensions of lungs and tonsils did not give positive results.
However, incubation with sera resulted in virus replication which was visible by the presence of CPE (cytopathic
effect) and was demonstrated by a PRRSV-specific staining. Subsequently, three passages on MARC-145 cells
were necessary to further adapt PRRSV (Lena) and a
virus stock with a titre of 104.6 TCID50/ml was obtained.
The alignment of ORF(s) 2a, 4, 5 and 7 of the macrophage-grown and MARC-145 adapted Lena isolates

revealed a 100% identity. This virus stock was used for the
preparation of IPMA antigens.
Animals and experimental design

At the age of six weeks, ten conventional pigs from a
PRRSV negative herd were inoculated oronasally with 106
TCID50/pig PRRSV (Lena) in 2 ml of phosphate buffered
saline (PBS, 1 ml in each nostril). Six pigs from the same
origin were inoculated with 106 TCID50/pig of a recently
isolated Belgian PRRSV, designated Belgium A, and
served as a reference group for comparison of the clinical
picture and virological findings. The Belgian PRRSV had
been isolated from lungs and spleen of a stillborn piglet
during a PRRSV outbreak in 2007. The herd experienced
the following problems: birth of dead and weak piglets,
high mortality rate among newborn piglets and respiratory disorders in growing pigs. The herd had been confirmed to be PRRSV positive. Sequencing demonstrated
that PRRSV (Belgium A) belongs to the European subtype 1 PRRSV. The animal experiment was approved by
the Ethical committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University (EC2008/057).
Clinical signs (body temperature, respiratory disorders,
and general signs such as appetite and behaviour) were
monitored daily in both groups starting from six days
before inoculation until the day of death or euthanasia.
Respiratory disorders were scored from 0 to 6 (for interpretation, see legend Figure 1).
From the Lena-inoculated pigs, sera and nasal swabs
were collected at 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 dpi and
stored at -70°C for virus titration. Also, sera were stored
at -20°C for PRRSV-specific antibody detection. Seven
out of ten Lena-inoculated pigs were anesthetized at 3, 14
and 21 dpi, for collection of tonsillar scrapings and in vivo
pulmonary lavage as previously described [30]. The other
three pigs were not treated and served as controls to
exclude negative effects of in vivo pulmonary lavage. The
lung lavages were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The
BAL fluids were collected, PAMs were resuspended in
PBS and the total number of PAMs was calculated. Tonsillar scrapings, BAL fluids and PAMs were stored at 70°C for titration. At 28, 35 and 42 dpi, two pigs were
euthanized and the following samples were collected:
right lungs (apical, cardial and diaphragmatic lobes), tonsils and inguinal lymph nodes. In the case of death, the
same organs were sampled. All samples were frozen and
stored at -70°C for virus isolation and titration. The
PAMs and BAL fluids were collected by pulmonary
lavage from the left lung as previously described [31].
From the pigs inoculated with PRRSV (Belgium A),
only sera were collected at the same time points as from
PRRSV (Lena)-inoculated animals. All samples were
stored at -70°C for virus titration and at -20°C for PRRSV
antibody detection.

Virus titration, serology and differential diagnosis

Sera, nasal swabs, tonsillar scrapings, BAL fluids, PAMs
and tissue suspensions were titrated on PAMs from
PRRSV negative pigs, as previously described [29]. For
collection of nasal swabs and tonsillar scrapings, aluminum Rayon sterile plain swabs (COPAN, Italia) were
used. Plain swabs were weighed before and after swabbing and viral titres were calculated per 100 mg of secretions. The monoclonal antibody P3/27 against the
nucleocapsid protein was used for the detection of
PRRSV-infected cells. PRRSV-specific antibodies were
detected by an IPMA on Marc-145 cells as previously
described [31]. PRRSV (Lena) and PRRSV (Belgium A)
adapted on Marc-145 cells were used as IPMA antigens.
In the case of death or euthanasia, pigs were necropsied, lungs and heart were collected and bacteriological
analyses were performed. All samples were inoculated on
Columbia agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood
(Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) with a Staphylococcus pseudintermedius streak for support of Actinobacillus and Haemophilus spp. growth, and on Columbia CAN agar with
5% sheep blood (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). Plates were
incubated overnight in a 5% CO2-inriched environment
at 37°C and identification of isolated bacteria was performed as previously described [32]. PK-15, MDCK and
CK cells were inoculated with 20% suspensions of lymph
nodes and lungs for detection of circovirus 2, influenza
virus and parvovirus/enteroviruses, respectively.
Antigenic characterization

Sera from PRRSV (Lena)-inoculated pigs collected during
the pathogenesis study were used. Two other panels of
polyclonal antisera were obtained from six-week old pigs
inoculated oronasally with 106 TCID50/pig of the PRRSV
(Lelystad) [28] (10 pigs) or PRRSV (US5) (7 pigs). Blood
samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 21 dpi. To
examine the antigenic heterogeneity between East European subtype 3 Lena, European subtype 1 Lelystad and
North American US5 strains, a serological cross-reaction
study was undertaken and three panels of antisera were
tested in IPMAs with Lena, Lelystad or US5 viruses as
antigens.
Statistical analysis

The difference between the overall courses of antibody
titres obtained in three IPMAs with homologous antigens
and between virus titres was analyzed by one way
ANOVA. The differences between serological results in
IPMAs with homologous and heterologous viral antigens
at every sampling time point were assessed by non-parametric Wilcoxon matched pairs test. All statistical tests
were performed with the STATISTICA 6.0 software. Differences were considered statistically significant at p ≤
0.05.
