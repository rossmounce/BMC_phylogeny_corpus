A role for p38 MAPK in the regulation of ciliary
motion in a eukaryote
Margarida Ressurreição1,2, David Rollinson2, Aidan M Emery2, Anthony J Walker1*

Abstract
Background: Motile cilia are essential to the survival and reproduction of many eukaryotes; they are responsible
for powering swimming of protists and small multicellular organisms and drive fluids across respiratory and
reproductive surfaces in mammals. Although tremendous progress has been made to comprehend the
biochemical basis of these complex evolutionarily-conserved organelles, few protein kinases have been reported to
co-ordinate ciliary beat. Here we present evidence for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) playing a
role in the ciliary beat of a multicellular eukaryote, the free-living miracidium stage of the platyhelminth parasite
Schistosoma mansoni.
Results: Fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that non-motile miracidia trapped within eggs prior to hatching
displayed phosphorylated (activated) p38 MAPK associated with their ciliated surface. In contrast, freshly-hatched,
rapidly swimming, miracidia lacked phosphorylated p38 MAPK. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry
demonstrated that treatment of miracidia with the p38 MAPK activator anisomycin resulted in a rapid, sustained,
activation of p38 MAPK, which was primarily localized to the cilia associated with the ciliated epidermal plates, and
the tegument. Freshly-hatched miracidia possessed swim velocities between 2.17 - 2.38 mm/s. Strikingly, anisomycinmediated p38 MAPK activation rapidly attenuated swimming, reducing swim velocities by 55% after 15 min and 99%
after 60 min. In contrast, SB 203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, increased swim velocity by up to 15% over this duration.
Finally, by inhibiting swimming, p38 MAPK activation resulted in early release of ciliated epidermal plates from the
miracidium thus accelerating development to the post-miracidium larval stage.
Conclusions: This study supports a role for p38 MAPK in the regulation of ciliary-beat. Given the evolutionary
conservation of signalling processes and cilia structure, we hypothesize that p38 MAPK may regulate ciliary beat
and beat-frequency in a variety of eukaryotes.

Background
Motile cilia are microscopic membrane-bound extensions of certain cells that are vital for the survival and
reproduction of many eukaryotes. By beating in a regular pattern these evolutionarily-conserved organelles
exert mechanical force; they thus play important roles in
motility of small organisms and facilitate fluid movement across epithelial surfaces in complex multicellular
animals. In addition to their role in fluid movement,
motile cilia have recently been found to possess sensory
functions in mammals, a feature previously thought to
be restricted to non-motile ‘primary’ cilia [1,2]. Given

that motile cilia are essential to physiology it is not surprising that defects in these organelles cause multiple
human disorders [3-5]. Such ciliopathies include primary
ciliary dyskinesia resulting in an inability to clear
mucous and debris from airways [6], hydrocephalus
caused by abnormal spinal fluid movement in the ventricles of the brain [7], and situs inversus (inversions of
the normal left/right symmetry of organs) a consequence of altered nodal flow during embryogenesis
[8,9]. Motile cilia (and flagella, which are essentially long
motile cilia) are also essential for the completion of the
life cycles of various parasites of humans and animals.
For example, they power locomotion of schistosome larvae (miracidia) enabling host-finding and thus infection
of the snail intermediate host [10], and are required for
migration of trypanosomes between gut and salivary

glands in the tsetse fly vector [11], and for viability of
the bloodstream trypanosome form [12].
Motile cilia (and flagella) are composed of nine microtubular doublets and, usually, two central mictrotubular
singlets, comprising the axoneme; dynein arms and radial
spokes associated with the axoneme generate and control
axonemal bending and thus force generation. The regulation of ciliary beating has been the focus of much
research [13], and proteomic studies including those on
the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have
aimed to describe the repertoire of proteins present
within eukaryotic cilia and flagella, or their component
fractions [14-19]. The proteomic analysis of Chlamydomonas flagella revealed over 90 putative signal transduction proteins including kinases and phosphatases [14],
some of which might be anchored to the axoneme [20],
highlighting the importance of signalling and reversible
protein phosphorylation in the function of motile cilia
and flagella. This is further supported by the recent identification in this organelle of 32 flagella phosphoproteins
with 126 in vivo phosphorylation sites [21]. Despite these
advances, our understanding of kinase-mediated cell signalling mechanisms regulating ciliary motion is still rudimentary, being largely restricted to the roles of the
cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase A (PKA)
[13,22-24], and protein kinase C (PKC) [13,25-27].
The surface of the schistosome miracidium is almost
entirely covered with numerous motile locomotory cilia
which, in Schistosoma mansoni, emerge from 21 ciliated
epidermal plates arranged in tiers [10]. The S. mansoni
miracidium is fully developed in the egg when it is
released in the faeces of the infected definitive (human)
host; upon water contact the miracidium hatches and
swims rapidly to locate a suitable intermediate freshwater snail-host. Miracidia movements respond rapidly
to various environmental cues such as the presence of
host-snail components [28] or salinity [29], suggesting
that these motile cilia might possess sensory functions
as is the case with Paramecium [reviewed in [2]]. While
studying kinase-mediated cell signalling in S. mansoni
during miracidia development we observed an
unexpected event, namely that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) attenuated
miracidial swimming. This kinase, an orthologue of the
yeast HOG kinase, participates in signalling cascades that
regulate transcriptional responses to stress [30] as well as
having other non-transcription factor targets such as
cytosolic phospholipase A2 [31]. Here we report findings
that support a role for p38 MAPK in the regulation of
ciliary motion of the multicellular eukaryote S. mansoni.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of S. mansoni p38 MAPK

As with other MAPKs, p38 MAPK has been highly conserved during metazoan evolution [32]. Recently, the

Page 2 of 11

draft genomes for S. mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum were published [33,34] allowing S. mansoni p38
MAPK gene candidates to be identified and further
assessed for similarity to p38 MAPKs from other organisms, including closely related schistosomes (Figure 1).
For S. mansoni only a single putative p38 MAPK was
identified and only partial cDNA reads were found;
moreover, only one p38 MAPK was found in S. japonicum (Figure 1). Thus, in contrast to D. melanogaster
and human which possess two and four p38 MAPKs
respectively [32,35,36], it seems that schistosomes may
possess one p38 MAPK orthologue only. Based on the
partial sequence data (XP_002571000) spanning 74
amino acids, and supported by more complete data
from S. japonicum, the identified S. mansoni p38 MAPK
was most similar to p38a MAPK (MAPK 14) of
humans, the most evolutionarily-conserved p38 MAPK
[35]. In addition, there exist a number of putative exons
on two separate scaffolds (Smp_scaff000038 and
Smp_scaff06141) additional to the 74 amino acid fragment that, when translated, also match closely with the
S. japonicum sequence; thus, we assume given the phylogenetic proximity between the two species that
S. mansoni p38 MAPK is very similar to S. japonicum
p38 MAPK. As for all other p38 MAPKs in the p38 subfamily, the dual phosphorylation site in the S. mansoni
p38 MAPK activation loop reads Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY)
(Figure 1). The substrate binding site Ala-Thr-Arg-Trp
(ATRW) is also conserved, as is the kinase interaction
motif (KIM) docking site (Figure 1) which binds linear
KIM sequences present in substrates and MAPK phosphatases [37]. Pair wise comparisons of the S. mansoni
p38 MAPK fragment with corresponding sequences for
other organisms revealed ~69-70% similarity with
human, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Danio rerio, and 86.5% with S. japonicum.
Anti-phospho p38 MAPK monoclonal antibodies were
used in an attempt to detect phosphorylated p38 MAPK
in S. mansoni. These antibodies, that bind p38 MAPK
only when dually phosphorylated on Thr/Tyr of the
TGY motif, have been used to detect phosphorylated
p38 MAPK in many multicellular eukaryotes including
C. elegans [38] and D. melanogaster [39]. Because phosphorylation on these residues results in activation of the
enzyme, immunoreactivity directly correlates with p38
MAPK activity. The p38 MAPK amino acid sequence
surrounding the TGY motif to which these antibodies
are raised is highly-conserved between both S. mansoni
and S. japonicum, and between S. mansoni and C.
elegans, D. melanogaster, D. rerio and human (Figure 1).
Western blotting of adult worm homogenates revealed
that anti-phospho p38 MAPK antibodies recognized a
single protein band with apparent molecular weight of
approximately 42 kDa, essentially co-migrating with
phosphorylated p38 MAPK from human astrocytoma

(U251 MG) cells (Figure 2A). In marked contrast to
adult worms, freshly-hatched swimming miracidia did
not possess detectable levels of phosphorylated p38
MAPK (Figure 2A). A second antibody (anti-p38
MAPK) that detects p38 MAPK in vertebrates irrespective of phosphorylation state did not react with the
S. mansoni protein precluding its use in this study.
A p38 MAPK immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit
was next employed to confirm that the S. mansoni protein recognized by the anti-phospho p38 MAPK antibodies possessed p38 MAPK activity. Immunoprecipitates
from adult worm homogenates phosphorylated the p38

MAPK substrate activating transcription factor 2
(ATF-2) (Figure 2B). The anti-inflammatory pyridinylimidazole compounds (SmithKline Beecham, SB) inhibit
p38 MAPK with both activity of the phosphorylated
enzyme and its autophosphorylation affected [40]. These
inhibitors compete with ATP at the ATP binding site
and exhibit no, or very weak inhibitory activity toward
the closely related MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
[41]. SB 203580 inhibits both p38a and p38b MAPK
and the interactions between the inhibitor and human
kinases have been mapped using crystallography and

antibody recognizes an S. mansoni protein with p38
MAPK-like activity that can be inhibited by the p38
MAPK inhibitor SB 203580.
Anisomycin is a known potent stimulator of p38
MAPK phosphorylation, and therefore activation, so we
considered that this compound might activate p38
MAPK in freshly-hatched swimming miracidia that
lacked the phosphorylated (activated) form of the
enzyme (Figure 2A). Western blotting revealed that
treatment of these miracidia with 20 μM anisomycin for
15 min induced considerable p38 MAPK phosphorylation when compared to controls, which appeared to
increase after 30 min and was sustained over 60 min
(Figure 2C).
The results of the above biochemical experiments,
coupled with the bioinformatic analysis, are commensurate with the S. mansoni immunoreactive protein being
a p38 MAPK orthologue.

Figure 2 Biochemical characterization of S. mansoni p38 MAPK.
(A) Immunodetection of phosphorylated S. mansoni p38 MAPK.
Protein from astrocytoma (U251 MG) cells (lane 1), 900 freshlyhatched swimming miracidia (lane 2), or an adult worm pair (lane 3)
was processed for western blotting using anti-phospho p38 MAPK
antibodies. (B) Activated S. mansoni p38 MAPK phosphorylates
activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), and SB 203580 inhibits p38
MAPK activity. p38 MAPK from adult worm pairs was
immunoprecipitated using immobilized anti-phospho p38 MAPK
antibodies and the immunoprecipitated protein used in an in vitro
kinase assay to phosphorylate ATF-2 either in the presence of SB
203580 (1-5 μM) or DMSO (D+), or with neither (D-).
Phosphorylation of ATF-2 by immunoprecipitated p38 MAPK was
assessed by western blotting using anti-phospho ATF-2 antibodies.
(C) Anisomycin activates p38 MAPK in S. mansoni miracidia. Freshlyhatched miracidia were exposed to anisomycin (20 μM) for various
durations and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in miracidia detected

were also probed with anti-actin antibodies to demonstrate equal
protein loading between lanes. Results shown in (A-C) represent
those obtained in at least two independent experiments.

amino acid substitution experiments [42,43]. The crucial
residues thought to be involved in this interaction are
shown in Figure 1; although falling outside the S. mansoni sequence fragment, these residues are conserved in
S. japonicum p38 MAPK. We thus postulated that SB
203580 would inhibit S. mansoni p38 MAPK. Pre-incubation of immunoprecipitates with SB 203580 prior to kinase
assay reduced ATF-2 phosphorylation considerably when
compared to immunoprecipitates incubated in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle alone; inhibition appeared dose
dependent with 5 μM SB 203580 almost completely
attenuating ATF-2 phosphorylation (Figure 2B). Thus the

To determine the localization of activated p38 MAPK
within S. mansoni miracidia, anti-phospho p38 MAPK
antibodies and confocal laser scanning microscopy were
used. Z-axis projections viewed in maximum pixel
brightness mode revealed that freshly-hatched swimming miracidia possessed low levels of phosphorylated
p38 MAPK, which is in agreement with western blotting
analysis (Figures 2A and 2C). However where activation
was evident, it appeared to be associated with the region
occupied by the cilia (Figure 3C). Miracidia incubated
with secondary antibodies alone possessed only background fluorescence (Figure 3B). When freshly-hatched
swimming miracidia were incubated with 20 μM anisomycin for 30 min, a striking increase in p38 MAPK activation was observed (Figure 3G) whereas DMSO
exposed (control) miracidia appeared similar to
untreated miracidia (data not shown). Analysis of serial
optical z-sections revealed activation largely at, or
adjacent to, the ciliated surface of the parasite (e.g.
Figure 3D). Fine z-sectioning and optical zooming
revealed that activated p38 MAPK was associated with
the shaft of the cilia (Figure 3E), further demonstrated
through co-localization using anti-acetylated tubulin
antibodies that permit visualization of these structures
(Figure 3F). Immunoreactivity was present up to 6-7 μm
from the tegument surface which correlates with the
length (7-8 μm) of the cilia reported from transmission
electron microscopy studies [10]. Staining for activated
p38 MAPK was also observed in the tegument (Figures
3E); here the enzyme could either be associated with the
base of the cilia, the microvilli (1 μm long [10]) that are
known to exist among the cilia, the rootlet (2 μm long
[10]) that is thought to provide support [44], or other
structures. The semi-spherical terebratorium (anterior

papilla) lacks cilia (Figure 3A) but possess filopodia-like
sensory endings [10] thought to play a role in sensing the
intermediate snail host. Although staining was observed
at the terebratorium, it was noticeably less than that
observed in the adjacent ciliated plates (Figure 3G).
While observing miracidia by immunofluorescence
microscopy a solitary egg was found on the microscope
slide, this egg had ruptured to allow hatching but fortunately still contained the miracidium which stained successfully with antibodies. Strikingly, and in contrast to
swimming miracidia, the hatching miracidium possessed
considerable p38 MAPK activity that via z-section analysis was found to be cilia-associated. Experiments were
then designed in an attempt to re-capture this event

and on several occasions miracidia were observed within
ruptured eggs; such miracidia contained cilia-associated
p38 MAPK activity considerably greater than that of
freshly-hatched swimming miracidia (Figures 3H-K).
Although various kinases including PKA, casein
kinase, adenylate kinase, cGMP-dependent protein
kinase and a putative MAPK have been identified in
proteomic screens of cilia/flagella e.g. [14,15], to our
knowledge p38 MAPK has not been detected by such
methods. P38 MAPK has however recently been localized to the post-acrosomal region and upper flagellum
mid-piece of human sperm by fluorescence microscopy
[45]. Although sperm tails are classified as flagella, their
regulation differs from motile cilia in some aspects;

sperm also possess a number of unique accessory structures [19] making them somewhat distinct from other
motile cilia.
Activation of p38 MAPK correlates with attenuation of
cilia beat and swim velocity

A

Miracidia swimming speed (mm/s)

Because p38 MAPK was active in stationary miracidia
within eggs but inactive in swimming miracidia, and
because p38 MAPK localized to cilia, we next explored
whether pharmacological activation or inhibition of p38
MAPK phenotypically affected ciliary function by performing swim velocity analyses. Miracidia were exposed
to anisomycin or SB 203580 and their swim behaviour
recorded by digital video microscopy (see additional file
1: Supplementary movie file). Determination of swim
velocities revealed that freshly-hatched miracidia swam
at speeds between 2.17 and 2.38 mm/s over 60 min
(Figure 4A and B); DMSO treatment did not affect
swim velocities over this duration (data not shown).
However, anisomycin (20 μM) significantly attenuated
miracidia swim velocity over time when compared to
untreated (spring water) controls (P ≤ 0.001) (Figure
4B); after 5 min and 30 min mean swim velocity was

reduced by 25% to 1.70 mm/s (P ≤ 0.01), and by 80% to
0.43 mm/s (P ≤ 0.001), respectively. After 60 min anisomycin treatment swimming essentially ceased. On the
other hand, SB 203580 (1 μM) significantly accelerated
miracidia swim velocity (P ≤ 0.001), particularly after 30
and 45 min treatment when it increased ~15 % (P ≤
0.001). Importantly, following 60 min anisomycin treatment, when spring water (to dilute the anisomycin concentration 10-fold) or SB 203580 (1 μM) were added,
the miracidia started swimming displaying swim velocities of between 0.4 and 0.6 mm/s after 20 min (data not
shown; see additional file 1: Supplementary movie file).
That the effects of anisomycin could be reversed
demonstrates that cessation of swimming was not due
to larval death. Thus, the contrasting effects of SB
203580 and anisomycin on swim velocity and the finding that p38 MAPK localizes to the cilia are consistent
with p38 MAPK playing a role in ciliary beat and thus
miracidia swimming. Anisomycin is thought to indirectly activate p38 MAPK via cdc42/rac, MAPKKKs,
MAPKK3 (MKK3) and MKK6 which ultimately phosphorylate p38 MAPK [46]. Importantly, orthologues of
these pathway components have been identified in S.
mansoni [33] suggesting that the mechanisms by which
anisomycin exerts its effect on p38 MAPK are conserved
between schistosomes and higher eukaryotes. P38
MAPK phosphatases have also been identified in
S. mansoni [33], allowing rapid dephosphorylation of
p38 MAPK when required. Although aspects of sperm
flagella make them distinct from other motile cilia it is
interesting that p38 MAPK inhibition by SB 203580 was
recently shown to stimulate forward and hyperactivated
motility of human sperm [45].
The mechanism by which p38 MAPK controls ciliary
beat is not known. Active p38 MAPK could attenuate
ciliary beat either by direct or indirect interactions
involving phosphorylation of axonemal components or
components within a ciliary signal transduction cascade,
respectively. Studies with C. reinhardtii have demonstrated that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
control flagella motility [20] and have highlighted the
complex nature of protein phosphorylation in this organelle [21]. Many potential kinase substrates exist that
co-ordinate ciliary motility including the dyneins [47]
and central pair kinesin KLP1 [48], but further characterisation of kinase substrates within cilia is needed.
Only a few other kinases have been reported to regulate cilia beat. PKA has been shown to attach to Paramecium ciliary axonemes, and strong evidence exists for
PKA playing a positive role in Paramecium swimming
and in controlling ciliary beat frequency of mammalian
cilia [13,22-24]. Interestingly, PKA has also been implicated in regulating the ciliary motion of S. mansoni miracidia [49]. While cGMP-dependent protein kinase

Activation of p38 MAPK accelerates loss of cilia during
larval transformation

When miracidia penetrate a suitable intermediate snail
host they shed their ciliated plates and develop into the
next larval stage, the mother sporocyst. This transformation can also be performed in vitro [52] during which
miracidia stop swimming before the plates are released.
As p38 MAPK activation attenuates miracidia swim
speed whereas inhibition accelerates it we explored the
effects of anisomycin and SB 203580 on deciliation and
thus swimming during miracidium-to-mother sporocyst
transformation in vitro. DMSO did not affect the deciliation rate when compared to Chernin’s balanced salt
solution (CBSS) controls and none of the treatments
affected the survival of the developing larvae (data not
shown). Anisomycin accelerated the shedding of ciliary
plates considerably (Figure 5B); after only 2 h transformation 52 % of parasites had stopped swimming having
shed at least some cilia in contrast to only 18 % of parasites in the CBSS control group (P ≤ 0.001; Figure 5B).
At this time point 20 % of anisomycin-treated larvae
had shed all their ciliated plates compared to none in
CBSS alone (data not shown). This effect of anisomycin
persisted throughout larval transformation (Figure 5B).
Although the effects of SB 203580 were somewhat less
marked, at 21 h, 25 h and 29 h significantly more miracidia were observed swimming (with all cilia attached)
than were present in the CBSS control group (Figure
5A). Thus, p38 MAPK activation appears to accelerate
the initial rate of S. mansoni miracidium transformation
by attenuating cilia-mediated swimming behaviour leading to early release of ciliated plates.

(cGMP) has also been shown to positively regulate ciliary beat frequency [13,50], like for p38 MAPK, PKC has
been implicated in slowing ciliary beat [13,25-27].
Clearly, more research is needed into the influence of
kinase activities on ciliary movement. For example,
ERK1/2 has recently been found to bind radial spoke
protein 3 in mammals and regulate its interaction with
PKA [51]; however, the extent to which ERK actually
influences motility via this interaction warrants
investigation.

p38 MAPK might play multiple parts in co-ordinating
swim behaviour, including sensory roles as described/
hypothesized for motile cilia in other organisms including parasites [1,2,53]. Given the conservation of both
signalling processes and structure/function of motile
cilia, we hypothesize that p38 MAPK might regulate ciliary beat frequency in a variety of metazoans. Thus our
findings could have implications for studies into motility
of other important multicellular eukaryotes including
parasites of humans, and for research into various
human ciliopathies.

Methods
Conclusions
Here biochemical, innunohistochemical and functional
data are presented that are consistent with p38 MAPK
playing an important part in the regulation of ciliary
beat and thus swimming behaviour of the multicellular
eukaryote, S. mansoni. The marked difference in p38
MAPK activation between un-hatched or stationary miracidia and actively swimming miracidia is striking. Localization of active p38 MAPK to both the cilium shaft
and the tegument of stationary miracidia implies that

Sequence characterization of S. mansoni p38 MAPK

S. mansoni p38 MAPK gene candidates were identified
from version 4.0 of the schistosome genome assembly
by searching S. mansoni GeneDB hosted by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, relying on the existing
annotation [33,54]. Although only partial cDNA reads
were found, they were further assessed for similarity to
p38 MAPKs from other organisms using the NCBI
tBLASTx search tool [55], limited to bilateria (organism)
and the nucleotide dataset. Protein sequences of

Ressurreição et al. BMC Cell Biology 2011, 12:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/12/6

candidates with matches to p38 MAPK genes were
aligned to those of other organisms, including that for
S. japonicum [34] using Geneious Pro 4.85 (Biomatters
Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) with Blosum62 cost
matrix, threshold = 1 and default parameters. Pair wise
identity scores were also obtained using Geneious Pro.
Isolation of S. mansoni miracidia and adult worms

Adult worms were recovered by portal perfusion of
patent mice infected with S. mansoni (Belo Horizonte
strain) and were immediately snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Livers and spleens were
then removed from the infected mice and S. mansoni
eggs isolated; miracidia were then hatched from eggs for
up to 2 h in natural spring water (Evian) and were collected under a dissecting microscope using a Pasteur
pipette [52]. Miracidia were washed three times in
spring water in a Stericup filter (0.45 μm PVDF membrane, Millipore, Watford, UK). The same filter was
then used to concentrate the miracidia (to achieve
approximately 10,000 miracidia/ml); enumeration of larvae was performed in aliquots under an inverted light
microscope. Animal use received appropriate local ethical approval.
Pharmacological activation and inhibition of p38 MAPK

The effect of the p38 MAPK activator anisomycin on
p38 MAPK phosphorylation (activation) in S. mansoni
was assessed by western blotting using anti-phospho
p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) monoclonal antibodies
(Cell Signalling Technology, New England Biolabs,
Hitchin, UK) that recognize only the phosphorylated
(activated) form of the enzyme. Freshly-hatched miracidia (~900 per treatment) were incubated in anisomycin
(20 μM in spring water) or spring water containing vehicle (0.02% (v/v) DMSO) for varying durations (15, 30 or
60 min) and then immediately placed on ice and proteins extracted by adding an appropriate volume of 5x
SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by brief homogenization. Samples were then boiled for 5 min and sonicated
briefly. After cooling, protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, Poole, UK) were added at the manufacturer’s recommended concentrations and samples stored
at -20°C prior to electrophoresis.
Schistosoma mansoni protein samples were separated
on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry electrotransfer unit (Bio-Rad,
Hemel Hempsted, UK). After staining with Ponceau S
to confirm homogeneous transfer, membranes were
blocked for 1 h in 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk, and
then incubated anti-phospho p38 MAPK monoclonal
antibodies (1/1000 in tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20
(TTBS) containing 1% (w/v) BSA) overnight at 4°C.
Next, blots were washed in TTBS and incubated for 2 h

Page 8 of 11

at room temperature in horse-radish peroxidasecongugated secondary antibodies (Cell signalling Technology; 1/5000 in TTBS) before further washing and
incubation in West Pico chemiluminescent substrate
(Pierce, Tattenhall UK) for 5 min. Immunoreactive bands
were then visualised using cooled CCD GeneGnome chemiluminescence imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge,
UK). Equal loading of proteins on blots was checked by
stripping blots for 3 h at room temperature with Restore
western blot stripping buffer (Pierce), before briefly
washing blots in TTBS and incubating blots with antiactin antibodies (1:3000 in TTBS; Sigma). Human astrocytoma (U251 MG) cell lysates, used as positive control
for detection of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, were kindly
provided by Suzanne Newton (Kingston University).
To determine p38 MAPK activities of proteins immunoprecipitated using anti-phospho p38 MAPK antibodies, a non-radioactive p38 MAPK activity assay kit was
used (Cell Signalling Technology). Ten adult worm pairs
were homogenized in cell lysis buffer (250 μl), the lysate
cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a microfuge
for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant recovered. Subsequently, 2 μl of immobilized anti-phospho p38 MAPK
(Thr180/Tyr182) monoclonal antibodies were added to
the lysate and samples were gently mixed overnight at
4°C. Subsequently, the immune complex was washed
twice in cell lysis buffer and re-suspended in kinase buffer before 1 μl of ATP and 1 μl of ATF-2 fusion protein
were added to start the kinase reaction. After 30 min
the reaction was terminated by adding an appropriate
volume of 5x SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples
were then boiled, sonicated and processed for western
blotting using anti-phospho ATF-2 primary antibodies.
All buffers and reagents used were provided in the p38
MAPK assay kit. In parallel experiments, the p38 MAPK
inhibitor SB 203580 (1 μM, 2 μM, or 5 μM) or vehicle
(0.02 % (v/v) DMSO) was added to the immunoprecipitates 15 min prior to the start of the kinase assay.
Immunohistochemistry

Freshly-hatched swimming S. mansoni miracidia were
either fixed immediately in absolute acetone or were
treated with anisomycin (20 μM), or vehicle (0.02 % (v/
v) DMSO), for 30 min prior to fixing. In some experiments, miracidia were left to hatch from eggs for short
durations (10 - 20 min) prior to fixing in absolute acetone; this was done in an attempt to recover miracidia in
the process of hatching from the egg. All parasites were
then stored at 4 °C. For further preparation acetone was
removed and samples washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before being permeabilized in 0.3%
(v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h and washed with PBS prior
to blocking in 10% (v/v) goat serum (Invitrogen, Paisley,
UK) for 1 h. After a further wash with PBS, parasites

Ressurreição et al. BMC Cell Biology 2011, 12:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/12/6

were incubated with anti-phospho p38 MAPK mAb
(1:50 in 5% (w/v) BSA) for 3 days on a microfuge tube
rotator. The parasites were then washed twice in PBS
for 1 h each and incubated in Alexa fluor 488 secondary
antibodies (1:500 in 5% (w/v) BSA) for 24 h in the dark,
followed by a further wash in PBS for 1 h. To detect
cilia, miracidia were also incubated as above in antiacetylated tubulin mouse monoclonal antibodies (1:100
in 5% (w/v) BSA; Sigma, Poole, UK) and Alexa fluor 594
secondary antibodies. Next, parasites were placed on
microscope slides, left to air dry prior to mounting in
Vectashield (Vecta Laboratories, Peterborough, UK)
anti-bleaching medium, and sealed with transparent nail
polish. All incubations were carried out at room temperature and incubations and washes were done in 2 ml
screw cap tubes. Miracidia and eggs were then visualized
on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser scanning
microscope using a 20x dry objective or 40x and 63x oil
immersion objectives and images collected with Leica
software. Since S. mansoni miracidia autofluoresce, the
signal received for the negative controls (i.e. those incubated only with secondary antibodies) was reduced. This
was achieved by reducing the power level of the photomultiplier tube, which was then kept constant for all
observations.
Scanning Electron microscopy

For conventional scanning electron microscopy, acetone
fixed miracidia or eggs were plated on individual coverslips and left to air dry, they were then placed in PBS
for 4 h, dehydrated in ethanol, briefly soaked in hexamethyldisilazane and evaporated, and sputter-coated with
gold-palladium. Specimens were then visualized on a
Zeiss EVO50 scanning electron microscope.
Analysis of S. mansoni swim velocity

Freshly-hatched miracidia in spring water were divided
into 200 μl aliquots and exposed to either SB 203580 (1
μM), anisomycin (20 μM), vehicle (DMSO, 0.02% (v/v)),
or were left untreated. Each sample was then immediately placed into a small sterile Petri dish and the 200 μl
droplet spread out using a pipette; care was taken to
ensure that the size and spread of the droplet was consistent between experiments to minimize artefacts in
measurement owing to the miracidia swimming out of
the horizontal plane during recordings. Light influences
considerably miracidia swimming behaviour, so light
intensity and positioning also remained constant for all
experiments which were performed at 27°C. Miracidia
were videoed over 60 min. There were approximately 10
miracidia in each sample and at least 30 miracidia per
treatment were analysed in three independent experiments. Visualization was achieved using an Olympus
SZ4045 binocular dissecting microscope and avi-format

Page 9 of 11

video recordings were made using a JVC TK-1481 composite colour video camera linked to Studio Launcher
Plus for Windows software. Digital videos were subsequently processed using the freely-available analysis software ImageJ [56] to determine swim path length of
individual miracidia in 5s permitting swim velocities
(mm/s) to be calculated at various time points after
treatment.
Analysis of deciliation during larval transformation

Recovered eggs from schistosome-infected mice were
hatched in spring water containing penicillin and
streptomycin (100 units/ml each). Collected miracidia
were then washed, and concentrated using Stericup filters, in sterile Chernin’s balanced salt solution, pH 7.2,
[57] containing glucose and trehalose and the same
antibiotics (CBSS + ). Approximately 1500 miracidia
were placed onto individual wells of 6-well cell culture
plates (Nunc, Loughborough, UK) and further 2 ml of
either CBSS+, or CBSS+ containing DMSO, SB 203580,
or anisomycin (0.02% (v/v), 1 μM, and 20 μM final
concentrations, respectively) added. The culture plates
were then placed in a dark, humidified chamber in an
incubator at 26°C. Three independent experiments
were performed and media was not changed during
larval development. At various time points during
development (4h - 55 h), 30 parasites from each sample were randomly selected using an inverted microscope and the percentage of parasites retaining all of
their ciliated plates was recorded. Larvae were determined as being alive if they displayed either swimming
or contractile movements, or if flame-cell flickering
was visible [52].
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab 15 Statistical Software; two sample t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed as appropriate.

revived following subsequent incubation in SB203580.
