insensitive gene and leaf length in a Lolium
perenne L. synthetic variety

Abstract
Background: Association studies are of great interest to identify genes explaining trait variation since they deal
with more than just a few alleles like classical QTL analyses. They are usually performed using collections
representing a wide range of variability but which could present a genetic substructure. The aim of this paper is to
demonstrate that association studies can be performed using synthetic varieties obtained after several panmictic
generations. This demonstration is based on an example of association between the gibberellic acid insensitive
gene (GAI) polymorphism and leaf length polymorphism in ‘Herbie’, a synthetic variety of perennial ryegrass.
Methods: Leaf growth parameters, consisted of leaf length, maximum leaf elongation rate (LERmax) and leaf
elongation duration (LED), were evaluated in spring and autumn on 216 plants of Herbie with three replicates. For
each plant, a sequence of 370 bp in GAI was analysed for polymorphism.
Results: Genetic effect was highly significant for all traits. Broad sense heritabilities were higher for leaf length and
LERmax with about 0.7 in each period and 0.5 considering both periods than for LED with about 0.4 in each
period and 0.3 considering both periods. GAI was highly polymorphic with an average of 12 bp between two
consecutive SNPs and 39 haplotypes in which 9 were more frequent. Linkage disequilibrium declined rapidly with
distance with r 2 values lower than 0.2 beyond 150 bp. Sequence polymorphism of GAI explained 8-14% of leaf
growth parameter variation. A single SNP explained 4% of the phenotypic variance of leaf length in both periods
which represents a difference of 33 mm on an average of 300 mm.
Conclusions: Synthetic varieties in which linkage disequilibrium declines rapidly with distance are suitable for
association studies using the “candidate gene” approach. GAI polymorphism was found to be associated with leaf
length polymorphism which was more correlated to LERmax than to LED in Herbie. It is a good candidate to
explain leaf length variation in other plant material.

Background
Genetic association studies using accessions of unknown
pedigree are increasingly used in plant biology to identify genes explaining variation of traits. Indeed, when
compared to quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses, these
studies present the advantage of i) comparing concomitantly several alleles, ii) avoiding laborious population
constructions and iii) exploiting the recombination
events that have occurred over several generations [1-3].

For association studies, two approaches are possible
base on the pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD)
decline [4]. The first one is the candidate gene approach
used for populations showing a rapid LD decline. The
second one is the whole genome scan approach used for
populations showing a slow LD decline [4]. These two
approaches have been mainly used for analysing the
genetic variability of a species through core collections.
However, core collections are often genetically structured, thus leading to the detection of spurious associations between the polymorphism of markers and traits
[5-7]. In order to circumvent the detection of spurious

associations, different methods of data analysis have
been developed that take into account the core collection’s substructure [5]. Nevertheless, the use of these
methods allows only to study the intra-group variability
while leaving the inter-group variability unexploited.
Ideally, the best plant material for association studies
should be multi-allelic and without any substructure.
This is the case in synthetic varieties, obtained after several panmictic multiplication generations, as shown by
Auzanneau [8]. However, to our knowledge, there are
no previous reports concerning association studies on
synthetic plant varieties.
Perennial ryegrass is the most sown forage and turf
grass species in temperate climate and it is considered
as a model for genomics in forage grasses [9]. In this
species, like in all forage grasses, leaf length is an important trait affecting: i) vegetative yield [10-12], ii) intake
rate by dairy cows [13], iii) plant survival under light
competition conditions [14]. Furthermore, it is a quantitative trait presenting a large variability and a high heritability [15-17].
GAI plays an important role in plant growth in several
species by acting on the gibberellin signal [18]. Mutants of
this gene exist in various species, with dwarf or giant phenotypes. Some dwarf mutants are OsGAI in rice [18], RhtD1 in wheat [19] and gai in Arabidopsis [20,21] and some
giant mutants are SLR1 in rice [22], sln in barley [23,24],
and spy in Arabidopsis [25]. Moreover, GAI is mapped on
linkage group 3 in rice [26]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=13699786&itemID=65&view=gbwithparts and on linkage group 4 in perennial ryegrass
[27]. In addition, a QTL of leaf length was found on linkage group 4 in the region of GAI [28].
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that an association study following the candidate gene approach is possible in synthetic varieties. This demonstration is based
on an example of association between the gibberellic acid
insensitive gene (GAI) polymorphism and leaf length
polymorphism in ‘Herbie’, a synthetic variety of perennial
ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) which presents no substructure and a short LD decline [8]. Moreover, a core collection of perennial ryegrass was used in order to compare
the phenotypic variability observed in ‘Herbie’ against the
variability present within the species.

Methods
Plant materials

We studied 216 plants of the ‘Herbie’, a synthetic variety
chosen because of its large variability and because LD
decreases rapidly [8]. It was registered for the first time
in 2000 in France. We used the fourth generation of
multiplication after the initial polycross in which 336
parents with 4 different origins were involved (Figure 1;
Thieu Pustjens pers. com.). Seeds were sown in summer

Page 2 of 13

2003 in individual pots and stored above 10°C with at
least 14 hours of light per day in a greenhouse in order
to avoid vernalization until the 24th of February 2004.
At this date, three clones per plant of one main tiller
were produced for phenotyping in spring and one clone
was produced for conservation. This last clone was used
to produce three new clones in autumn. We used 100
ecotypes (one plant per population) chosen in an Eurasian core collection in order to maximise the number of
geographical origins (François Balfourier, pers. com.,
Supplementary data). For convenience, we named these
100 ecotypes: core collection (Cc). Seeds of this collection were sown in February 2004 in individual pots and
stored above 10°C with at least 14 hours of light per day
in a greenhouse until the 30th of September 2004. At
this date, three clones per plant of one main tiller were
produced.
Phenotyping

Two experiments with three replicates each were conducted in a greenhouse: the first in spring 2004 with
Herbie genotypes and the second in autumn 2004 with
Herbie and Cc genotypes. For each plant, one main tiller
with its daughter tillers was planted at both periods.
Plants were watered and nitrogen supplied in order to
avoid any stress. After a growth period of three weeks,
plants were cut back. The third and fourth uncut leaves
that appeared after this defoliation were measured on
one tiller per plant, three times a week from the time of
their emergence until they reached maturity. Thermal
time was calculated in growing degree days (°Cd) using
a simple sum of mean daily air temperature above 0°C
taking the day of cutting as a starting point. The spring
experiment began on March 17, 2004 and finished on
May 12. However, the plants were followed until the
end of July in order to confirm their vegetative state by
the absence of floral stem. The autumn experiment
began on October 21, 2004 and finished on January 12,
2005. During the autumn experiment, the greenhouse
was heated to maintain a temperature higher than 10°C.
Final leaf length and leaf growth kinetics of the third
and fourth uncut leaves were used as phenotypic character for the association analysis. In order to estimate the
parameters of leaf growth kinetics, leaf length measurements for each plant and leaf against thermal time were
fitted a function inspired from the Euler integral
[12,29,30], such that:
te − t
Y = Ym · 1 +
te − tm

·

te − tc
t − tc te − tm
te − tc

(1)

for tc ≤ t ≤ te and tc ≤ tm < te. For t > te, Eq. 1 is
reduced to Y = Ym.

Figure 1 Description of the creation of the variety ‘Herbie’.

Y (mm) is the leaf length at any time, Ym (mm) is the
final leaf length, tc the time when leaf growth starts (°
Cd), tm is the time at which the maximum leaf elongation rate is reached (°Cd) and te is the time when leaf
growth ends (°Cd). Model fitting was performed by
using the NLIN procedure of SAS [31]. Parameters were
optimised using the Levenberg-Marquardt iterative
method with automatic computation of the analytical
partial derivatives [32,33]. Seed values were as followed:
tc ranged from 0 to 10 increasing by 1; tm ranged from
10.001 to 1,000 increasing by 10 and te ranged from 150
to 1,200 increasing by 10. For each leaf, Ym value was
given by its maximum measured length. Only plants

with data on both the third and fourth leaves were analysed. An example of the Eq. 1 fitted to data is given in
Figure 2.
It follows from Eq. 1 that the leaf elongation duration,
LED, expressed in thermal time units (°Cd), is given by
difference te - tc. However, because the fitting procedure
yielded a few negatives values without physiological
meaning for tc, and in order to avoid incoherent estimates of LED, we numerically estimated the time at
which any leaf was 5 mm long, and called this value tc5.
LED was then estimated as:
LED = te − tc5

The maximum leaf elongation rate, LERmax, for each leaf
was numerically obtained from Eq. 3. Summarising, three
variables were studied at two growing periods, spring and
autumn: final leaf length (Llength), leaf elongation duration
(LED) and maximal leaf elongation rate (LERmax).
DNA extraction

For each Herbie genotype, DNA was extracted from 1 g
of young leaf using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide
(CTAB) protocol [34,35]. DNA quantity and quality of
each sample were assessed on agarose gel.

performed with 40 ng of template DNA, 0.4 μM of each
primer (5’-GACYTGGAGCCSTTCATGCT-3’; 5’-GTACACCTCSGACATGACCT-3’), 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM
dNTP, 1 U Platinium Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) and 1X PCR buffer (Invitrogen). The
amplifications were performed using a PTC100 thermal
cycler with the following program: 10 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 58.7°C for 1 min
and 68°C for 2 min, a final extension of 10 min at 68°C.
PCR product of each sample was purified using QIAquick Multiwell PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and
sent to Millegen, Toulouse, France for direct sequencing
of PCR products with the forward primer. The direct
sequencing of the PCR products allowed to obtain the
genotype of each SNP but not the phase between SNPs.
Sequences of GAI were obtained for 190 ‘Herbie’
genotypes.
Phenotypic data analysis

Genotyping

Herbie plants were genotyped using one SSR marker per
linkage group (LG): B4D7 on LG1, G02-049 on LG2,
G07-058 on LG3, G03-10 on LG4, pps397 on LG5,
G04-56 on LG6 and G02-004 on LG7 [36,37]. PCR reactions and separation of amplified products were performed as described for SSRs in Barre [28].
In order to amplify a fragment of the GAI gene in
Lolim perenne L., degenerated primers were designed on
an alignment between OsGAI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=13699786&itemID=65&view=gbwithparts, Rht-D1a (AJ2425311), SLN-1
(AF460219) and DWARF8 (AJ242530) homologous GAI
gene in rice, wheat, barley and maize, respectively. A
sequence of 370 bp in GAI was amplified in the coding
region (Figure 3). PCR reactions were set up in 50 μL
volumes in 96-well PCR plates. Each PCR reaction was

For ‘Herbie’ and Cc separately, analyses of variance were
conducted using GLM procedure (SS type 3) in SAS 8.1
[31]. Genotypic effect for each trait in each experiment
was analysed using the model:
Yij = μ + Gi + Bj + eij ,

with Yij the value of genotype i taken in the block j, μ
the population average, Gi the effect of genotype i, Bj
the effect of the block j and eij the residual. For each
trait, the broad sense heritability (h2) was estimated as:
h2 =

Genotypic variance ( σGE ) and residual variance ( σE )
were estimated using the VARCOMP procedure of SAS
with the method residual maximum likelihood algorithm
REML [31].
For ‘Herbie’, a general analysis of variance taking into
account the two periods of measurement (spring/
autumn) was also performed. Plants used in spring and
in autumn were independent clones, so the model used
was:

Yijk = μ + Gi + Pk + (G × P)ik + Bj (Pk ) + eijk

(6)

with Yijk the value of genotype i taken in the block j
for the period k, μ the average of the population, Gi the
effect of genotype i (random effect), Periodk the effect of
period k (fixed effect), (G × P)ik the effect of the interaction Genotype × Period (random effect), B j (P k ) the
effect of block j nested in period k (fixed effect) and eijk
the residual (random effect). G and P effects were tested
using G × P interaction as residual and G × P interaction was tested using the model residuals.
For each trait, the broad sense heritability (h 2 ) was
estimated as:

tion variance ( σGExPeriod ) and residual variance ( σE ) were

the method REML [31].
Pearson’s correlations between traits were calculated
on the adjusted means by genotype (option LSMEANS
of GLM procedure) using the CORR procedure of SAS
[31].

Population substructure analysis

STRUCTURE software version 2.3 [5] was used to estimate the substructure of ‘Herbie’. The length of the
burn-in period was 50,000 and the number of MCMC
replications after the burn-in was 100,000 for each. The
given number of populations (K) was varied between 1
and 10. Computing was performed 50 times for each K
value.

GAI polymorphism analysis

The identity of amplified sequences was checked using a
BLASTN on NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
. The sequences were aligned and manually checked
using STADEN package 1.6.0 http://staden.sourceforge.
net/. Data were formatted using TRITIPOL http://bioweb.ensam.inra.fr/tritipol/ and REFSEQV5 (pers. com.
Fabienne Granier, INRA, Versailles, France). Haplotype
phase between SNPs was estimated using PHASE 2.1
software [39,40]. Haplotype number and haplotypic genotype for each individual were inferred.
LD analysis

The r2 values of gametic LD between SNPs were determined according to Hill and Robertson [41] on the haplotypes inferred by PHASE using DNAsp software [42].
Genotypic LD between each pair of SNPs or SSRs was
calculated using GENEPOP software [43].
Association study analysis

The association study was carried out independently for
each period of measurement by using adjusted means
per genotype. Three different approaches were used to
test the association between the polymorphism of GAI
and leaf elongation parameters:
1) a multiple linear regression analysis between leaf
elongation parameters and SNPs. The stepwise method
was used to fit a linear model of the general form:
Yi = β0 + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + . . . + βn Xn + εi

(8)

where Yi is any dependent variable (in our case:
Llength, LERmax or LED);X1, X2,..., Xn are the independent variables (in our case: 20 SNPs), b0, b1, b2,..., bn,
the regression coefficients and εi the error term. It was
computed with the STEPWISE option of REG procedure
in SAS [31].
2) a Scheffe’s multiple comparison analysis for orthogonal linear contrasts [44] in order to test the effect of
presence versus absence of each not rare haplotype (i.e.
more than 10 plants holding the haplotype). It was computed with the GLM procedure in SAS [31] following
the model given by Eq. 4.
3) a tree-scanning analysis of the phenotypic data
against the haplotype tree. It was performed with
TREESCAN 1.0 http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/treescan.
html[45,46]. This method allows testing the mean difference of a trait between two groups obtained for each
branch of a phylogenetic tree. Haplotypes present more
than 10 times in the population were used to construct
a phylogenetic tree with PHYLIP 3.67 http://evolution.
genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html using maximum
parsimony. In the execution of the TREESCAN program

the number of permutations was 5 000, and the minimum class size was set to five.

Table 2 Heritability of leaf parameters over periods

Population substructure analysis

Results from the analysis with STRUCTURE software,
using one single sequence repeat (SSR) marker per linkage
group, showed no evidence of substructure in ‘Herbie’
(Table 5). Furthermore, as expected between unlinked
markers in a population presenting no substructure, no
significant genotypic LD was detected between pairs of
SSRs.

LERmax

Llength, LERmax and LED were determined for 216 plants
of ‘Herbie’ in spring and autumn and on 100 plants of a
perennial ryegrass core-collection (Cc) in autumn. Three
replicates were used. Genetic effect was highly significant
for all traits for both Herbie and the Cc and for both
growing periods. Heritability was high for Llength and
LERmax and medium for LED (Table 1). For all traits, a
significant Genotype × Period interaction was detected in
‘Herbie’ and moderate heritabilities were found for both
periods (Table 2). The variability of ‘Herbie’ was as high as
the variability of the ‘Cc’ (Table 3). Correlation values
between variables are presented in Table 4 for ‘Herbie’
including both spring and autumn measurements. For the
‘Cc’, correlations between variables during autumn were
highly significant (P value < 0.001) between Llength and
both LERmax (0.87) and LED (0.46), but not significant
(P value > 0.05) between LERmax and LED. In both ‘Herbie’ and the ‘Cc’, leaf length was significantly correlated to
both LERmax and LED with higher values for LERmax.
On the other hand, LERmax and LED were not or were
weakly correlated. Leaf parameters measured in spring
were correlated to those measured in autumn with a
stronger correlation for Llength and LERmax than for
LED.

coefficient of variation (CV) and heritability (H2)

GAI polymorphism

Twenty SNPs were detected in the 370 bp GAI sequence
of ‘Herbie’ (Table 6). This corresponds to an average of 12
bp between two consecutive SNPs. Among these SNPs, six
presented rare alleles with frequencies lower than 10% and
one (GAI206) was not synonymous. PHASE software
revealed the existence of 39 haplotypes (Table 7). Nine of
them were present in more than 10 genotypes.
LD analysis

Gametic LD decreased rapidly with the distance (Figure 4).
Indeed, r2 values became lower than 0.1 beyond 150 bp.
Genotypic LD results were in agreement with Gametic LD
results (data not shown). For distances lower than 150 bp,
more than 35% of SNP pairs presented a significant LD
(threshold at 0.01 after a Bonferroni correction). Nonetheless, beyond 150 bp, SNP pairs did not present any significant deviation from linkage equilibrium.
Association study between GAI and leaf growth
parameters

Three statistical methods were used to detect the association between the phenotypic polymorphism and GAI
polymorphism.
The first method was a stepwise regression between
leaf parameters and the 20 SNPs of GAI found in ‘Herbie’ (Eq. 8). The results are summarized in Table 8. It
showed that, depending on the leaf parameter, three to
six SNPs explained 8-14% of the phenotypic variance
(R2). One SNP, named SNP069, appeared to be particularly interesting since it explained 2-5% of each parameter variance in both spring and autumn. It explained
a difference of leaf length equal to 42 mm, for average
leaf length of 312 mm, in spring and a difference equal
to 30 mm, for an average of 303 mm, in autumn. It is
noteworthy that the highest values of leaf growth parameters were obtained for heterozygous individuals
showing a superdominance effect at SNP069.
The second method consisted of a Scheffé analyses in
order to test the effect of presence versus absence of the
different haplotypes on each trait (Table 9). The comparisons of means for the significant contrasts are presented in Table 10.

Distribution of individuals (means over three clones) for leaf length (Llength), leaf elongation duration (LED) and maximum leaf elongation rate (LERmax) in spring

The third method was a tree-scanning analysis of associations between haplotypes and leaf parameters. The haplotype tree is presented in Figure 5 and the results of the
TREESCAN analysis is presented in Table 11. The strongest effect of phylogenetic groups on all traits was on LERmax in spring between the group of haplotypes: 2, 9, 10
and 15, and the group of haplotypes: 24, 25, 27, 30, 37.
These two groups can be separated by polymorphism at
SNP069 (Table 7). This separation had also an effect on
Llength in spring. An effect was found on LERmax in
spring and in autumn between the group of haplotypes 24
and 25, and the group including all the other haplotypes.
These two groups can be separated by SNP114 and
SNP138 which were in complete linkage disequilibrium
when considering the nine most abundant haplotypes
(Table 7). For all tests, the corrected permutational Pvalues after monotonicity were higher than 0.05.

Discussion
Phenotypic analyses

The phenotypic variability of ‘Herbie’ was very high and
similar to the one observed in a core collection (Cc).
This high variability of ‘Herbie’ was also observed on
molecular data [8]. Such variability can be explained by

the high number of parents (336) in the initial polycross.
This diversity shows that selection should be efficient
even within a variety.
High heritability values were observed for leaf length
and maximum leaf elongation rate (LERmax) within each
period of measurements. Lower heritabilities were
observed when taking into account both spring and
autumn periods. These results are in accordance with
values from different studies in forage grasses
[16,17,47-49]. The significant Genotype × Period interaction indicates that the response of genotypes to environmental conditions did not follow the same trajectories.
This is reflected by the correlation values between spring
and autumn leaf length or LERmax which were only moderately high (Table 4). As previously observed by Ghesquière [17], leaf elongation duration (LED) had a lower
heritability. This could be partly explained by a lack of precision in the LED estimates since no measurement could
be performed at the beginning of leaf growth, during the
hidden phase.
Spring and autumn leaf length averages in ‘Herbie’
were not significantly different. However, these similar
leaf lengths were not reached by the same dynamics of
leaf growth. It was observed a higher LERmax and a

shorter LED in spring than in autumn, that could be
explained by higher temperatures in spring (average of
16°C) than in autumn (average of 13°C).
The correlation between leaf length and LERmax was
higher than the one between leaf length and LED in
spring and in autumn for both ‘Herbie’ and the core collection. Similar results were observed by Ghesquière [17]
in a collection of late heading perennial ryegrass ecotypes with correlations of 0.86 and 0.53 between adult
leaf length and average leaf elongation rate and LED,
respectively. It could be explained by the fact that at the
beginning of leaf growing process there is a long period

the impact of LERmax and LED on final leaf length

traits appear poorly correlated, a given final leaf length
can result from different combinations of a wide range

P-values (a) of Scheffé analyses for the effect of presence (+) versus absence (-) of a haplotype for leaf length (Llength), maximum leaf elongation rate (LERmax)
and leaf elongation duration (LED) in spring and autumn on ‘Herbie’. The nine most abundant haplotypes were tested. The numbers of samples including the
haplotype (+) or not (-) are indicated. The values below 0.05 are in bold

about 1 kb due to its outbreeding reproductive system
[51-53]. This rapid LD decline and the absence of substructure allowed a “candidate gene” approach in this
genome region [4]

GAI polymorphism

The density of SNPs was very high but comparable to
that obtained in other genes in perennial ryegrass, bearing in mind that this parameter is highly variable over
the genome [50,51]. Nevertheless, the number of haplotypes observed in ‘Herbie’ is relatively weak compared to
the haplotype numbers expected. Knowing that there
were 336 individuals in the initial polycross of the ‘Herbie’ variety and considering that they were unrelated, 672
haplotypes were expected under the assumption of total
absence of LD. However, only 39 haplotypes were
observed, and among those, 30 had a frequency lower
than 2%. This implies that the parents of ‘Herbie’ were
related and some haplotypes were highly selected.

Association study between GAI and leaf growth

This study in the highly diverse variety Herbie revealed
that the GAI gene had a significant effect on leaf growth
parameters: leaf length, maximum leaf elongation rate and
leaf elongation duration, in both spring and autumn growing periods. This gene co-localized with QTL of lamina
length found in spring and with QTL of leaf length and
LER found in winter on linkage group 4 [28]. One SNP,
SNP069, explained a part of the variability of all leaf length
parameters in both spring and autumn. It was also found
significant in the tree-scanning analysis. However this SNP
does not induce an amino acid variation. Considering the
rapid LD decline, the mutation responsible for leaf growth
variability in ‘Herbie’ should be very close and highly
linked to SNP069. In Arabidopsis, wheat and maize,
mutants responsible for dwarf phenotypes present a deletion on the DELLA domain [19,21]. An association study
on the whole gene sequence would be of interest to find
the causal mutation. The possible association between the
variation of the SNP069 and the variation of leaf length in

Substructure and LD analyses

Based on the analysis of 216 plants, we confirmed that
Herbie presents no substructure and that LD decay was
very short in the GAI gene as reported by Auzanneau [8]
based on the analysis of 47 plants. The absence of substructure and this rapid decline of LD with the genetic
distance in Herbie were expected owing to the high number of parents and the variability in the initial polycross
of the variety. Moreover, LD decline in perennial ryegrass
is generally rapid and become not significant beyond

Figure 5 Haplotype tree of the SNP polymorphism from the
GAI gene. The haplotypes are shown in Table 6. Only haplotypes
present more than 10 times were taken into account. The arrows
indicate the transitions with a Psim higher than 0.05 in the treescanning analysis. The tree was obtained from the program
PhyloDraw (contact: jhchoi@pearl.cs.pusan.ac.kr) on the basis of the
treefile output from PHYLIP.

‘Herbie’ only by chance without any physical link between
the SNP069 and the causal mutation (false positive) can be
considered. This would imply that the SNP069 and a causal mutation elsewhere on the genome were in linkage disequilibrium. This LD can’t come from a population
substructure as we demonstrated the absence of structure
in the population. It could come from a drift due to the

Traits

Tree-scanning analysis of associations between haplotypes and leaf
parameters: leaf length (Llength), leaf elongation rate (LER) and leaf
elongation duration (LED) in spring (spr) and autumn (aut) on ‘Herbie’.
Branches with Psim (permutational probability before correction for multiple
testing) lower than 0.05 are shown. Pvk is the proportion of the trait variation
explained by the partition. PMon is the corrected permutational P-value after
monotonicity is enforced

sampling of a limited number of individuals (216) but this
seems unlikely regarding the high significance of the
SNP069 on leaf length. Nevertheless, in order to test the
real physical association between the SNP069 and a causal
mutation for leaf length, it would be interesting to create
populations with GG or CC at the SNP069 and to compare their leaf length.
A superdominance effect was found for all leaf growth
parameters on SNP069 except for LERmax in autumn.
This could be due to two very close SNPs with dominant effects with the favourable alleles in repulsion. This
superdominance effect could also be explained by a real
complementary effect of both alleles at a single SNP.
Whatever the origin of the superdominance effect, this
observation should have consequences on breeding strategies. The objective of molecular assisted selection
could thus be to associate two alleles instead of fixing
favourable alleles.
The results of the three methods used for the association
study were all in agreement. Nevertheless, the maximum
number of associations was found with the regression analysis using SNPs which seems more effective since it
explained a higher level of phenotypic variance than the
other two methods. A possible explanation is that haplotypes cumulate alleles of several SNPs which could have
opposite effects leading to a decrease in the difference
between haplotypes.
In the present study a single panmictic population, a
synthetic variety, allowed us to detect a strong association
between a SNP polymorphism and a trait. In the study of
Skot [53] a strong association was detected between one
SNP:4443 of the LpHD1 gene and heading date (HD).
Nine populations of perennial ryegrass, each including 96
plants, were used. Despite an overall association of
SNP:4443 and HD, this association was more or less
strong depending on the population. This shows that LD
varies between populations leading to associations in some
populations but not in others. Regarding this observation,
it would be of interest to perform association studies
within panmictic populations rather than to use individuals from several populations. Indeed, different associations can be found depending on the population used.
Unlike the findings of Thornsberry [54] in maize, we
did not observe an effect of GAI gene on heading date
in ‘Herbie’ (data not shown). However, we studied only
a small part of the gene.

Conclusions
In this study, we showed that i) association studies can be
performed following the “candidate gene” approach on a
synthetic variety with a wide genetic basis, and ii) the
detection of association between phenotypic polymorphism and sequence polymorphism was more powerful
using SNP polymorphism than haplotypic polymorphism.

These observations could impact the way of using molecular information in plant breeding, in particular in outbreeding species. Indeed, the genetic basis of important
traits could be directly detected in breeder populations
and molecular markers used to increase favourable
alleles.
