Diagnosis and molecular characterization of
rabies virus from a buffalo in China: a case report

Abstract
Background: Rabies virus (RABV) can infect many different species of warm-blooded animals. Glycoprotein G plays
a key role in viral pathogenicity and neurotropism, and includes antigenic domains that are responsible for
membrane fusion and host cell receptor recognition.
Case presentation: A case of buffalo rabies in China was diagnosed by direct fluorescent antibody test, G gene
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and RABV mouse inoculation test. Molecular characterization of the
RABV was performed using DNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence comparison based
on the G gene from different species of animals.
Conclusion: The results confirmed that the buffalo with suspected rabies was infected by RABV, which was
genetically closely related to HNC (FJ602451) that was isolated from cattle in China in 2007. Comparison of the G
gene among different species of animal showed that there were almost no amino acid changes among RABVs
isolated from the same species of animals that distributed in a near region. However, there were many changes
among RABVs that were isolated from different species of animal, or the same species from different geographic
regions. This is believed to be the first case report of buffalo rabies in China, and the results may provide further
information to understand the mechanism by which RABV breaks through the species barrier.

Background
Rabies virus (RABV) is one of the seven species in the
genus Lyssavirus in the Rhabdoviridae family [1]. All
warm-blooded animals, including raccoons, skunks, bats
and foxes, are susceptible to RABV, and domestic dogs
act as the main reservoir and transmitter [2]. The
annual number of human deaths caused by rabies is
estimated to be 55,000 worldwide [3], with about 32,000
in Asia [4]. The total number of human deaths was
108,412 between 1950 and 2004 in China [5]. The average number was 1,524 from 1996 to 2008, and 50% of
cases were reported in Guangxi, Hunan and Guizhou
provinces [6]. Therefore, the disease continues to be a
serious public and animal health problem in China.
RABV has a non-segmented, negative-sense, singlestranded RNA genome about 12 kb in length [7], with
five genes: L (RNA polymerase), G (glycoprotein), M

(matrix protein), P (phosphoprotein), and N (nucleoprotein) [8]. The order of relative conservation of these five
genes from high to low could be either N>L>M>P>G,
or N>L>M>G>P[9]. Glycoprotein G of RABV plays an
important role in pathogenicity [10,11] and viral neurotropism [12] because it contains membrane fusion sites
[13] and host cell receptor domains [14,15]. In recent
years, molecular epidemiology [16-18] and diagnosis
[19,20] of rabies have been based on the G gene.
The aims of the present study were to diagnose a case
of buffalo rabies that occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei
Province, using three different methods, and to compare
the sequences with different RABVs that were isolated
from different species, based on the G gene. This is
believed to be the first report of the phylogenetic analysis of buffalo RABV in China compared with other isolates from different animals.

Case presentation
Specimens were collected from the gyrus hippocampi of
the buffalo with suspected rabies in Wuhan City (114.3°E,
30.8°N), Hubei Province, China. Direct fluorescent

antibody test (dFAT) of the specimen was performed as
previously described [21-23]. Normal buffalo brain samples were used as a negative control. RABV isolation by
mouse inoculation test was performed as described previously [24,25].
The total RNA from buffalo brain was extracted with
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer design and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the G gene
were performed as described previously [17]. RT-PCR
products were visualized under UV light after electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The amplified products were purified with a
QIAquick PCR gel extraction kit (QIAGEN) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The sequencing was carried out in an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA automated
sequencer. After the raw sequences were edited by ClustalX Version 1.82 [26], 1575 nt sequences of the G gene
were obtained and submitted to GenBank.
The phylogenetic tree based on the deduced amino acid
sequences was constructed by using the neighbor-joining
method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA version 4.0 software [27], based on the complete sequence of
the RABV G gene from 10 different species of animal
(Table 1). Bootstrap values >70% were considered significant [28]. Genetic distance analysis for the G gene was
conducted with PHYLIP version 3.63 software [29]. Glycoprotein nucleotide sequences from different animals were
identified, translated into amino acid sequences, edited,

and pair aligned using BioEdit software [27]. Multiple
alignments were performed by ClustalX software [26].

Conclusion
dFAT indicated the presence of RABV antigen in the
brain specimens from the buffalo with suspected rabies
(Figure 1A), whereas normal buffalo brain did not
(Figure 1B). The expected size of the G gene fragment
was obtained from the suspected buffalo brain by RTPCR (data not shown). RABV from buffalo was isolated
successfully in suckling mice (data not shown), and the
RABV was named Hubei070308 strain. The positive
result was supported by G gene sequencing, and the
sequences were submitted to GenBank under the accession number EF643518.
The G gene sequence, together with reference sequences
from seven countries and 10 species of animals were
aligned (Table 1). We showed that the G gene of RABV
had relative territorial specificity but not species specificity
(Figure 2). The genetic relationship of the RABV in this
study was differed greatly from PG(AY009097) that was
used as a vaccine strain in China in 1931. Compared with
18 other RABV strains, Hubei070308 shared 85.0-99.8%
sequence identity at the amino acid level (data not shown).
We demonstrated that Hubei070308 strain was close to
the cattle strain FJ602451 and the human strain
DQ849063, which belong to Chinese group I [17], but it
was far from coyote strain U52946, which was isolated in
1996 in the United States (Figure 2).

brain sample.

Additional File 1, Figure S1 shows that the amino acid
changes were mainly focused on the transmembrane areas
(aa 440-461), inner-membrane zone (aa 462-505) and signal peptide range of mature RABV glycoprotein. Glycoprotein sequences of Hubei070308 were identical to HNC
(FJ602451) that was isolated from cattle in 2007. However,
there were many amino acid substitutions when it was
compared with RABVs from other animals such as skunk,
dog, human, bat and deer. The linear epitope (aa 14-19) at
antigenic site II and the minor site between aa 342 and 343

were highly conserved, which was consistent with the findings of Meng et al. [17]. Among all the RABVs, SHBRV
strain that was isolated from bats was the most variable at
the amino acid level. Many different animals can be
infected by RABV [2], and cases of transmission from bats
to humans [30], dogs to humans [17] and even dogs to
pigs [31] have been reported. For a virus shed by one host
to infect another, it must break through entry barriers (e.g.,
epithelium, mucus, and alveolar macrophages) and find its
way to tissues in which it can replicate [32].

It has been reported that several amino acids in the
RABV glycoprotein are responsible for pathogenicity
[33,34]. Therefore, RABV glycoprotein is the best target
protein to study virus-host interaction, or it may be the
main protein that is responsible for breakthrough of the
species barrier. In the present study, many amino acid
substitutions in G protein were found among RABVs
that were isolated from different animal species, or from
the same species distributed in different geographic
regions. These substituted amino acids may explain why
RABV can break through the host barrier to infect one
species of animal from another. This hypothesis needs
to be confirmed by further experiments.
