Abstract
Background: Legionellosis is a common cause of severe community acquired pneumonia and
respiratory disease outbreaks. The Ontario Public Health Laboratory (OPHL) has conducted most
testing for Legionella species in the Canadian province of Ontario since 1978, and represents a
multi-decade repository of population-based data on legionellosis epidemiology. We sought to
provide a laboratory-based review of the epidemiology of legionellosis in Ontario over the past 3
decades, with a focus on changing rates of disease and species associated with legionellosis during
that time period.
Methods: We analyzed cases that were submitted and tested positive for legionellosis from 1978
to 2006 using Poisson regression models incorporating temporal, spatial, and demographic
covariates. Predictors of infection with culture-confirmed L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1) were
evaluated with logistic regression models.
Results: 1,401 cases of legionellosis tested positive from 1978 to 2006. As in other studies, we
found a late summer to early autumn seasonality in disease occurrence with disease risk increasing
with age and in males. In contrast to other studies, we found a decreasing trend in cases in the
recent decade (IRR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.95, P-value = 0.001); only 66% of culture-confirmed
isolates were found to be LP1.
Conclusion: Despite similarities with disease epidemiology in other regions, legionellosis appears
to have declined in the past decade in Ontario, in contrast to trends observed in the United States
and parts of Europe. Furthermore, a different range of Legionella species is responsible for illness,
suggesting a distinctive legionellosis epidemiology in this North American region.

Background
Legionella species are Gram-negative bacteria that are
ubiquitous in both natural aquatic and moist soil and
mud environments [1,2] and in artificial aquatic habitats
[3]. Human infection with Legionella [4] has two distinct
forms – Legionnaires' disease, a more severe form of infection which includes pneumonia, and Pontiac Fever, a
milder febrile flu-like illness without pneumonia [5].
Legionellosis occurs both sporadically and in outbreaks;
the latter may be community-based, hospital-based, or
occur in the long-term care setting [6,7]. While major outbreaks make media headlines and prompt evaluation of
point-sources of exposure [8], most legionellosis is likely
sporadic. Although there are no clinical features unique to
severe legionellosis [9], case fatality rates are extremely
high (10–40%) and may approach 50% in nosocomial
outbreaks in individuals with already compromised
health status [10,11]. Sporadic cases are reported throughout the year with summer or autumn seasonality, presumably due to enhanced proliferation of the bacteria in
warmer aquatic environments [11,12].
Both sporadic legionellosis, and large legionellosis outbreaks are known to occur in the Canadian province of
Ontario [8,13], with over 1400 cases recorded between
1978 and 2006. However, the epidemiology of legionellosis in this region has not been reviewed previously in the
biomedical literature. The centralized nature of legionellosis testing in Ontario over a thirty year period, combined with the retention of culture-based testing by the
Ontario Public Health Laboratory (OPHL) in conjunction
with serological and antigen-based assays for disease,
make laboratory records a useful database for the evaluation of legionellosis trends in this jurisdiction since testing was first introduced. Our objectives were to provide a
laboratory-based review of the epidemiology of legionellosis in Ontario; to explore the diversity of Legionella species that cause disease in this province; and to evaluate
spatial and temporal patterns in legionellosis case occurrence over the past three decades.

Methods
Ontario is located in the east-central part of Canada and is
the most populous province in Canada (population
12,160,282 in the 2006 Canadian census, or 38.5% of the
Canadian population [14]). The province covers a large
geographic area (917,741 km2), with a sparse resident
population in much of northern Ontario; the most heavily populated areas of the province lie on or near the Great
Lakes. Administratively, disease control activities in the
province are the responsibility of 36 local public health
units (PHU); however, due to a high degree of variability
in PHU populations, it is convenient to aggregate these
PHU into seven Ontario "health regions" (OHR), which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/68

have populations that range from approximately 0.5 to 2
million persons. These OHR include Toronto, South
West, Central South, Central West, Central East, East and
North (Figure 1).
Legionellosis is a notifiable disease in Ontario, with all
testing for Legionella in the context of outbreak investigation, and most testing of clinical specimens, performed at
the OPHL in Toronto. Testing records for legionellosis are
available from May 1978 to the present; as such, the
OPHL database contains information on most identified
cases of legionellosis in Ontario over the past 30 years.
The database includes information on the dates of onset
of illness, case reporting, and laboratory testing; patient
age and sex; and the hospital or healthcare facility from
which test specimens were submitted, as well as the city or
public health unit in which the submitting facility is
located. Data are also available on testing type performed
and test results for all patients with at least one positive
test. As this is a laboratory-based database, information
on city or public health unit of residence for each case,
clinical characteristics and outcome, and such background data such as smoking status and or the presence of
co-morbid illness, was not available.
Case Definition and Testing Methods
Ontario adheres to the national case definition for
legionellosis as defined by the Public Health Agency of
Canada [15]. The culture of clinical specimens is regarded
as the gold standard for diagnosis of Legionnaire's disease
but immunoflourescence (direct fluorescent antibody
(DFA)) and serological assays (indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA)) targeting L. pneumophila antigen and L. pneumophila-specific antibodies can also be used [5].
Immunodiagnostic methods in our laboratory involve
routine testing using a large panel of reagents for both
DFA and IFA; species and groups included in routine testing include L. pneumophila serogroups 1 to 8, L. bozemanii,
L. jordanis, L. micdadei, L. dumoffii, L. gormanii, L. oadridgensis, L. longbeachae serogroups 1 and 2, L. feeleii serogroup 1, L. anisa, L. wadsworthii, and L. maceachernii. In
outbreak situations, up to 48 Legionella species can be
identified using IFA. Reagents are prepared following
standard protocols of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
(CDC); test interpretation is according to standard procedures defined by the CDC. Potential limitations of immunodiagnostic methods include inability to detect some
Legionella species, difficulty with validation of infection by
unusual strains (due to lack of clinical material) and the
potential for cross-reactivity.

A validated, in-house urine antigen immunochromatographic test (ICT) was used at the laboratory from 1984 to
2005 [16]; in 2005, poor performance of this assay in the
context of a large institutional legionellosis outbreak [17]

Average Rates of Legionellosis by Ontario Health Region, 1990 to 2006. Rates are per 100,000 persons per year, and

resulted in replacement of this assay with a commercially
available urine ezyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(Binax™).
The OPHL can receive up to three types of specimens per
patient (serum, urine and respiratory tract tissues); the
laboratory typically identifies and reports individuals as
legionellosis cases on the basis of information derived
from multiple, complementary tests (a mean of four independent tests were been performed on individuals identified as "cases" during the study period). A diagnosis of
legionellosis at the OPHL was confirmed when at least
one of the following criteria was met in conjunction with
a compatible clinical illness: (i) isolation of a Legionella
species or detection of the antigen from respiratory secre-

tions, lung tissue, pleural fluid, or other normally sterile
fluids; or (ii) a significant (four-fold increase or greater)
rise in Legionella antibody titre (both IgG and IgM
together) between acute and convalescent sera; or (iii) single specimen or standing Legionella antibody titre seroconversion from >=1:256 against Legionella sp.; or (iv)
detection of Legionella soluble urine antigen [16].
Statistical Analysis
Legionellosis rates were estimated by dividing provincial
or regional disease counts by the appropriate Statistics
Canada population estimates [14,18,19]. As Ontario's
current public health units were defined in 1995, PHU
population estimates were not available for prior years;
we estimated PHU populations from 1990 to 1995

through linear extrapolation, but did not attempt regional
rate calculations for years prior to 1990, due to concerns
that additional extrapolation would be inaccurate.
We evaluated temporal and spatial patterns in case occurrence using Poisson regression models; seasonality was
modeled by incorporating sine and cosine components
into regression models (i.e., via use of the "fast Fourier
transform") [20]. Models were used to estimate average
rates of disease, as well as incidence rate ratios (IRR) for
disease in population subgroups. Logistic regression was
used to evaluate temporal changes in the likelihood that
cases had been identified using different available testing
methodologies.
As visual inspection of disease data suggested nonlinear
changes in disease incidence over time, we evaluated both
linear, quadratic, and cubic trends in incidence by incorporating year, year-squared, and year-cubed terms into
regression models [21]; similar non-linear components
were incorporated into logistic models for evaluation of
trends in testing over time. We evaluated the improvement in model fit upon incorporation of a polynomial
(i.e., squared) term into the model using the likelihood
ratio test. As quadratic terms significantly improved
model fit, but are complex to interpret, we present linear
trends broken down into three decade-long time periods:
1978 to 1987; 1988 to 1997; and 1998 onwards; these latter estimates were generated using linear splining techniques [22]. Due to the potential for cross-reactivity of
sera used in immunodiagnostic methods, we defined
cases as having "definitive" speciation if the case was culture-confirmed, and "tentative" speciation if speciation
was based entirely on immunodiagnostic methods. We
restricted our analyses of trends and patterns of legionellosis occurrence according to species to culture-confirmed
cases. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA
version 9.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX) and
thematic maps were created using ArcGIS version 9.2
(ESRI, Redlands, CA). Due to the absence of personal
identifiers in the dataset, and the fact that the study
involved the use of a pre-existing dataset, the study
received expedited approval from the Research Ethics
Board of the Hospital for Sick Children.

Results
Epidemiological Profile of Legionellosis in Ontario
1401 cases of legionellosis were reported between May
1978 and December 2006; cases were identified in all
health regions (Figure 1). Most cases were identified
through testing performed on specimens submitted from
the Toronto health region (46.5%, n = 648). The average
annual number of legionellosis cases identified in the
province between 1978 and 2006 was 48.3 cases (range 5

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/68

to 139), for an estimated crude average incidence of infection of 0.41 per 100,000 person years.
Incidence of legionellosis peaked in late summer and
early autumn, with 49% of cases (n = 688) reported during the 4-month period from July to October, and significant seasonal oscillation (P for log-linear combination of
sine and cosine model terms < 0.001). Incidence was
markedly increased in incidence among older individuals;
75% of source patients (n = 1057) were aged 50 and over
(Figure 2 and Table 1). The summary incidence rate ratio
(IRR) for individuals aged greater than 50 years was 9.54
(95% CI 8.41 to 10.81, P < 0.001). Among individuals
aged 50 and over, there was a continuing, strong linear
trend for increased risk with increasing age (IRR per decade increase in age 1.67, 95% CI 1.58–1.77, P < 0.001)
(Figure 2).
Males were more likely to be infected than females, with
estimated annual infection rates of 0.55 per 100,000 as
compared to 0.35 per 100,000 in females (IRR 1.57, 95%
CI 1.41–1.76) (Figure 2 and Table 1). Although more
cases of legionellosis were reported in the oldest women
than in the oldest men, this effect was due to greater numbers of women surviving to advanced age; the annualized
rate of infection in the oldest men (11.2 cases per
100,000) was approximately double that seen in the oldest women (5.7 cases per 100,000) (Figure 2). The association between male gender and legionellosis risk was
strengthened by adjustment for older average age in the
female population (adjusted IRR 1.98, 95% CI 1.78–2.22,
P < 0.001).
Annualized rates by OHR, during the period between
1990 and 2006 (n = 1000), ranged from 0.12 cases per
year per 100,000 persons in the Eastern region to 0.87
cases per 100,000 persons in the Toronto region, with the
appearance of a northeast to southwest risk gradient in the
southern (most populous) part of the province (Figure 1).
The highest regional rate recorded during the study period
was 3.39 cases per 100,000 persons in the South West
region in 1998. There was, however, a significant increase
in legionellosis diagnosis in Toronto relative to nonToronto regions (IRR 2.96, 95% CI 2.6–3.4).
Temporal Trends in Case Occurrence
We found both graphical and statistical evidence for nonlinear changes in legionellosis incidence over time (Figure
3). Both year and year-squared terms were significantly
associated with disease rates (P for both terms < 0.001),
and the addition of a year-squared term significantly
improved model fit (likelihood ratio test χ2 62.0 with 1
d.f., P < 0.001). As such, we broke our study period into
three approximately decade-long intervals, and calculated
within-decade estimates of yearly trends. Disease rates

increased markedly from 1978 to 1987 (IRR 1.07, 95% CI
1.04–1.11, P < 0.001); increased less sharply from 1988 to
1997 (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06, P < 0.001); and
declined subsequent to 1998 (IRR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91–
0.95, P < 0.001). A decline in the most recent decade was
observed even when analysis was restricted to culture-confirmed cases (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90–0.99), and to cases
lacking culture positivity (IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90–0.95)
(Figure 2) and was also seen when the time series was
extended to 2008 using case count data from 2007 and
2008 (IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.99). From 1998 to 2006
there was no heterogeneity in observed trends according
to the presence or absence of culture confirmation (P =
0.39).

Temporal Trends in Testing
There was a significant increase in the probability of culture confirmation for cases during the 1990s (OR 1.59,
95% CI 1.40–1.81%, P < 0.001) and a significant decrease
in the probability of culture confirmation from 2000 to
2006 (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61–0.86, P < 0.001). Best fit
logistic models included a quadratic term, accounting for
the non-linear change in probability of culture confirmation over time. By contrast, there was a progressive
increase in the likelihood of cases having a positive urine
antigen test result over the entire study period (OR per
year 1.06, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.07, P < 0.001). The proportion of legionellosis cases with positive direct fluorescent
antibody (DFA) testing, or positive serological testing by
paired serology [23], also declined over time (OR for DFA
0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85; OR for paired IFA 0.95, 95%

Trends in Legionnellosis Case Counts and Rates by Age and Sex, Ontario 1978 to 2006. A marked increase in case
counts and disease rates is seen with increasing age. Diminished case counts in the oldest individuals (black bars) reflect small
size of population at risk; rates increase continuously (dashed black line). Case counts in males (gray bars) are higher than
those in females (white bars) in all but the oldest age groups. However, as fewer males survive to extreme old age, rates of disease per 100,000 population are higher in males (gray line) than in females (solid black line) in all age groups.

CI 0.92–0.94, P for both comparisons < 0.001). Seropositivity reported as a result of a single high-titre positive IFA
test was uncommon throughout the study period (Figure
4).
Legionella Speciation
Data on definitive Legionella speciation were available for
351 cases with culture confirmation. Tentative species
identification, based on direct and indirect immunological methods, was available for serum, tissue, and urine
specimens from 533 additional cases. The distribution of
species for culture confirmed isolates was significantly different for culture confirmed cases, as compared to those
without culture confirmation (χ2 squared 96.9 on 8 d.f., P
< 0.001) (Table 2). Because of heterogeneity in the distribution of species depending on the presence or absence of

culture confirmation, we restricted our subsequent primary analyses to culture-confirmed cases.
Among culture-confirmed cases, 10 distinct species of
Legionella were represented, as well as 9 distinct serogroups of Legionella pneumophila. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1) was the most commonly isolated strain,
with 66% of all isolates identified as LP1. LP6 and other
strains of LP comprised an additional 22% of isolates with
the remainder of cases associated with non-pneumophila
species (Figure 4). Among 533 cases with tentative speciation based on immunologic methods, a smaller proportion (52%) was identified as LP1, and a greater proportion
(36%) were identified as non-pneumophilia species.
When we evaluated predictors of the isolation of LP1 as
opposed to other Legionella strains, in 351 culture-con-

increased likelihood of LP1 speciation was seen between

95% C.I 1.09 to 2.73, P = 0.02). No differences were seen
with respect to gender or age and likelihood of LP1 species.

Discussion
The centralized nature of testing for legionellosis in the
Canadian province of Ontario allowed us to evaluate
trends in this disease over a period of approximately 30
years. To our knowledge, this represents the longest time
series of legionellosis cases in the biomedical literature,
dating to shortly after the initial identification of L. pneumophila as a human pathogen [24]. Our findings exhibit
similarities with previously published analyses of
legionellosis epidemiology, but also exhibit important
differences. We affirmed the strong associations between

male gender and advanced age and legionellosis risk that
have been described previously [11,12,25,26], and found
strong evidence for summer-autumn seasonality of
legionellosis in this region of Canada. Such seasonality
has been observed in studies from other developed countries, and may suggest that seasonal environmental influences on environmental reservoirs (such as surface
waters) influence human disease risk [12,25,27,28].
However, in this study we identify two features of
legionellosis epidemiology in Ontario that appear to be at
odds with observations in other jurisdictions: first, there is
an apparent recent decrease in disease incidence; the second difference relates to the distribution of Legionella species, and (within the L. pneumophila species) bacterial
serogroups associated with disease occurrence. Our identification of a statistically significant overall decrease in
legionellosis incidence in the province since 1998 (notwithstanding an extremely large outbreak that occurred in
the province in 2005 [17]), is at variance with reported
increases in legionellosis reported recently in other North
American jurisdictions, and in Australia and Europe
[12,25,26,29].
An important question raised by investigators in these
jurisdictions has been whether legionellosis incidence is
truly increasing, or whether changes in test practices (particularly the use of urine antigen testing) have increased
identification of this historically under-diagnosed infection. In a similar manner, differences in estimated
legionellosis burden and trends in Ontario, relative to
these other jurisdictions, could reflect true epidemiological differences, differences in regional testing practices
(and disease reporting) [30], or differences in importation
of travel-related legionellosis cases [31-33]. Other explanations for a true change in the burden of legionellosis in
Ontario during the study period are also possible; for
example, Canadian standards for construction and maintenance of hospitals and other public buildings were
updated between 1999 and 2001 [34]; such changes may
also have contributed to the amelioration of legionellosis
risk observed during the last third of our observation
period.
Indirect evidence suggests that differences in testing practice (particularly differences in the uptake of urinary antigen testing) are not primarily responsible for the
difference in observed disease trends in Ontario, relative
to other jurisdictions. As described above, there was a
marked increase over time in the likelihood that Ontario
legionellosis cases were identified by urine antigen testing, with or without other complementary testing methods. By contrast, the contribution of serological testing to
diagnosis decreased markedly during the period under
observation, and culture testing to diagnosis has changed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/68

in a non-linear fashion over time: we postulate that
increases in the likelihood of culture-based diagnosis in
our laboratory from the late 1980s to late 1990s may have
reflected increasing technical skill over time, whereas
declining probability of culture confirmation since 1998
may be attributable to changes in the use of urinary antigen testing mentioned above. In any case, the trends we
describe here were robust when we restricted our analyses
to cases with or without culture confirmation.
If the decline in legionellosis in Ontario reported here represents a true epidemiological shift, rather than an artifact
of clinical practice patterns and laboratory testing practices, it may be worth noting that almost all major population centers in Ontario (Ottawa being the exception) lie
< 30 miles from the Great Lakes. As Legionella species are
abundant in surface waters, and the Great Lakes ecosystem is currently undergoing rapid ecological change [35],
the possibility that downward trends in legionellosis
relate to changes in local hydrology warrants further
investigation. Although the proximate source of legionellosis is usually water distribution systems or coolingtower related aerosols, the seasonality of legionellosis,
described here and elsewhere [12,36], is also strongly suggestive of environmental influences on legionellosis risk.
We have recently demonstrated that acute changes in local
watershed hydrology in Toronto are linked to changes in
legionellosis risk [37]. These associations warrant further
investigation.
A second important difference between the epidemiological data reported here and those reported from other
jurisdictions was the identification of L. pneumophila 1
(LP1) in < 70% of cases with definitive speciation via culture methods (though exclusive use of culture-based
methods may also favor identification of L. pneumophila
species [38]); LP1 was identified in an even smaller proportion of cases with tentative speciation based on immunodiagnostic methods without culture confirmation. By
contrast, the proportion of legionellosis cases attributable
to LP1 has been reported to be > 90% in studies of
legionellosis performed elsewhere in North America and
Europe [39-41]. This may suggest that the parallel use of
type-specific immunodiagnostic methods (such as serum
IFA and tissue DFA, which are used in parallel with urine
antigen testing and culture test methods at our laboratory
whenever appropriate specimens are available) are important in the elucidation of the true diversity of pathogenic
Legionella species, and that exclusive reliance on urine
antigen testing methods may artificially inflate the proportion of cases due to LP1. Alternatively, this finding
may again suggest that the epidemiology of legionellosis
in this North American region is unique, and may be
heavily influenced by the proximity of major population
centers to the Great Lakes.

As might be expected given the geographic and demographic size and diversity of Ontario, we found evidence
for important within-province heterogeneity in disease
epidemiology as well. Disease incidence in the Eastern
OHR (where Ottawa represents the major population
aggregation) was approximately one tenth that seen in the
Toronto OHR. Although some clinical laboratory urine
antigen testing for legionellosis is performed in tertiary
care centers in Ottawa and Kingston, the magnitude of
this difference may, again, suggest that proximity to the
Great Lakes is an important modulator of disease epidemiology.
Like any observational study, this study has important
limitations. Principle among these is our use of a laboratory database for epidemiological purposes; this has the
effect of inflating case estimates for regions with high concentrations of tertiary care centers (such as Toronto), as
geographic coding reflects the locale of the healthcare
institution that submitted patient specimens for testing,
rather than patients' home addresses, and also means that
desirable covariates (such as immune compromise, smoking status, comorbid illnesses, and case outcomes) are
unavailable. Nonetheless we do not believe that such
reporting effects would explain the magnitude in
observed difference in disease burden between Toronto
and the Ottawa region (itself a major site of tertiary care
beds in the province). Furthermore, we believe that the
wide geographic base, prolonged interval of data collection, detailed information on testing practices, and performance of all testing by a single laboratory distinguish
this study from those of shorter duration conducted in
Europe and the U.S. [11,26], and from previous Canadian
sentinel surveillance efforts [13], and also provide new
insights into the distinctive epidemiology of this disease
in Canada's most populous province.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we evaluated trends in legionellosis case
occurrence and use of diagnostic modalities from the vantage of a major public health service laboratory over a
period of three decades. While observed legionellosis epidemiology in this jurisdiction bore some similarities to
that described in other jurisdictions, the apparent decline
in legionellosis in the past decade in Ontario, and the
wide variety of Legionella species identified in association
with illness, suggest that the epidemiology of legionellosis
in this North American region may be distinctive. Molecular epidemiologic studies in progress are likely to provide further insights into the phylogenetic characteristics
of pathogenic Legionella species in Ontario.
