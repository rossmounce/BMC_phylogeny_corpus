Abstract
Background: The least squares (LS) method for constructing confidence sets of trees is closely
related to LS tree building methods, in which the goodness of fit of the distances measured on the
tree (patristic distances) to the observed distances between taxa is the criterion used for selecting
the best topology. The generalized LS (GLS) method for topology testing is often frustrated by the
computational difficulties in calculating the covariance matrix and its inverse, which in practice
requires approximations. The weighted LS (WLS) allows for a more efficient albeit approximate
calculation of the test statistic by ignoring the covariances between the distances.
Results: The goal of this paper is to assess the applicability of the LS approach for constructing
confidence sets of trees. We show that the approximations inherent to the WLS method did not
affect negatively the accuracy and reliability of the test both in the analysis of biological sequences
and DNA-DNA hybridization data (for which character-based testing methods cannot be used).
On the other hand, we report several problems for the GLS method, at least for the available
implementation. For many data sets of biological sequences, the GLS statistic could not be
calculated. For some data sets for which it could, the GLS method included all the possible trees
in the confidence set despite a strong phylogenetic signal in the data. Finally, contrary to WLS, for
simulated sequences GLS showed undercoverage (frequent non-inclusion of the true tree in the
confidence set).
Conclusion: The WLS method provides a computationally efficient approximation to the GLS
useful especially in exploratory analyses of confidence sets of trees, when assessing the
phylogenetic signal in the data, and when other methods are not available.

Background
From a statistical point of view, the inference of phylogenies is similar to the estimation of an unknown quantity
in the presence of uncertainty. Given the intrinsic uncertainty in solving phylogenetic relationships from limited

(in size and numbers) samples, it is necessary to assume
that phylogenetic estimates are subject to stochastic and
systematic errors [1]. Consequently, the correct answer to
a phylogenetic problem is not a single estimate – one
topology optimal under the assumptions of a particular

phylogenetic reconstruction method. Rather, it is more
appropriate to derive a set of phylogenies that capture the
uncertainty about the solution to the phylogenetic reconstruction problem from the available data.
Several statistical procedures have been proposed to test
trees and to construct confidence sets of topologies
derived from sequence data. These procedures include the
bootstrap selection probability (BP) of Felsenstein [2],
and its modification [3], the Approximate Unbiased (AU)
test, which reduces test bias and improves the accuracy
and the simplicity of implementation. However, many
concerns have been raised about the use of BP [4-6]. Statistical tests of phylogenies based on maximum likelihood
(which also involve bootstrapping, either parametric or
non-parametric) include the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH; [7])
test, which was later modified by Shimodaira and Hasegawa (SH; [8]) to take into account test multiplicity, and
the Swofford-Olsen-Wadden-Hillis (SOWH; [9,10]) test.
Unfortunately, in some situations these tests give contradictory results [10,11]: the SH test seems to be too conservative, especially in comparison to the SOWH test,
which often rejects all but the maximum likelihood topology. Strimmer and Rambaut [11] have argued that these
discrepancies may be caused by model misspecification;
however, the solution they proposed, the expected likelihood weights (ELW) test, shares with the SOWH the
inconvenience of being computationally intensive.
The generalized least squares (GLS) method for constructing confidence sets [12,13] is closely related to least
squares (LS) tree building methods [14,15], in which the
goodness of fit of the distances measured on the tree
(patristic distances) to the observed distances between
taxa is the criterion used for selecting the best topology.
These methods do not require expensive calculations,
which make them applicable to the analysis of very large
data sets. However, the use of the GLS test for such data
sets is often frustrated by the computational difficulties in
calculating the covariance matrix and its inverse.
The GLS test [13] is based on the assumption that the evolutionary (observed) distance between each particular
pair of taxa takes a value drawn from a normal distribution centered on the patristic distance. Under a null
hypothesis that a given topology is true, the GLS test statistic:

∑

i , j ,k ,l

(

wij ,kl dij − eij

) ( dkl − ekl )

(1)

follows a chi-square distribution, provided the distances
are (approximately) normal (for example, they are maximum likelihood evolutionary distances; [13]). In this formulation, dij are the evolutionary distances, eijare patristic

distances (distances measured on the tree between taxa i
and j), and wij, kl are entries in the inverted matrix of variances and covariances of the distances.
The problem of estimating the covariance matrix has been
only recently solved by Susko [13]. Two methods for estimation of the variances and covariances were proposed:
the sample average method and bootstrap estimation.
Only the former was implemented; still, the analysis of
biological sequences showed that both give very close estimates [13]. Both methods require access to sequence data.
However, the advantage of distance methods of phylogenetic reconstruction, including those using the LS
approach, over character-based methods is that the distances need not be derived from sequences, and even if
they are, access to the character data is not necessary. In
principle, LS methods could be used for such data as an
alternative to bootstrapping [16] and jackknifing methods
[17].
The calculation of the GLS statistic requires inverting the
covariance matrix, which is not always possible. A solution suggested by Susko [18] is to ignore the entries in the
matrix that are close to zero, which results in a more conservative test. If the covariances are completely ignored,
and only the values in the diagonal (the variances) are
used, the sum gives a weighted least squares (WLS) statistic:

∑ wij ( dij − eij )

2

(2)

i, j

In this formulation, the distances are treated as independent to avoid computational difficulties. Again, one can
view this simplification as avoiding the division by numbers very close to zero, which results in a test statistic
smaller than the corresponding GLS statistic, and consequently fewer rejections (a more conservative test).
Although the phylogenetic distances are a priori not independent because taxa share evolutionary history, we have
shown in a previous work that ignoring the covariances
does not have drastic consequences for the reliability or
the accuracy of the LS approach to interior branch testing
in phylogenetic trees derived from sequences [6].
In this work we investigate the applicability of LS methods
for construction of confidence sets for topologies. We start
by re-analyzing a well-known data set of six long
sequences of mammalian mitochondrial proteins, for
which the GLS approach has been previously used. We
then explore the size of the confidence sets obtained with
the GLS and WLS methods using a database of nucleotide
sequences. Each data set in the database consisted of eight
sequences chosen to minimize the effects of model mis-

specification. This was necessary since the existing implementation of the GLS method allows its application only
when simple models of nucleotide substitutions are used
(the implementation of the WLS method we present does
not have such limitations). We also present a simulation
analysis in order to investigate both the size of confidence
sets and the coverage of the LS methods. Finally, we apply
the WLS method to two data sets for which the GLS
method could not be used: (i) a large number of short
viral sequences in which testing alternative phylogenies is
key in including or excluding patients from a nosocomial
outbreak of hepatitis C, and (ii) DNA/DNA hybridization
data, where neither the GLS method nor other methods of
topology testing which require access to character data can
be used.
The goal of this paper is to assess the applicability of the
LS approach to construct confidence sets of trees from biological data. We will explore the consequences in terms of
accuracy and reliability of the approximations inherent to
both the GLS and WLS method.

Results
Mammalian mitochondrial protein sequences
We will first consider the mammalian mitochondrial protein data set originally analyzed by Shimodaira and
Hasegawa [8], and then by Goldman, Anderson and Rodrigo [10], Shimodaira [3], Strimmer and Rambaut [11],
and Susko [13]. This data set consists of 3414 aligned
amino acids from six mammalian species: cow, harbor
seal, human, mouse, opossum, and rabbit. We have used
the generalized least squares test proposed by Susko [13]
implemented in the GLSPROT program [13], which uses
the PAM substitution model [19]. Table 1 shows the comparison of the results obtained with GLS and WLS tests,
and three tests based on likelihood (SH, KH and ELW
tests), assuming the PAM substitution model. All possible
105 unrooted topologies for six species were considered.

The GLS 0.95 confidence set, as has been previously
shown by Susko [13] for this data set, is formed by just
five trees. As expected, the WLS gives more conservative
results, and includes two more topologies in the 0.95 set.
Both the GLS and WLS 0.99 confidence sets include all the
trees containing the (seal, cow) cluster. The same 15 trees
form the 0.95 confidence set of the SH test, which for this
data set is the most conservative. The sets of topologies
accepted by ELW and KH tests at the 0.95 level include five
and six trees, respectively.
With a more appropriate mtREV+G substitution model
[20] the SH, KH and ELW methods gave similar results
(for the ELW, tree number four was excluded, for the KH,
tree number five was included, and number seven
excluded from the 0.95 confidence set). The WLS method

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/105

put all 15 trees with the (sea, cow) cluster in the 0.95 confidence set. It would be interesting to know how the GLS
results would be affected by using a different substitution
model, but as was mentioned above, only the PAM model
has been implemented in the existing software [13].
The size of LS confidence sets for nucleotide sequence data
The high computational efficiency of LS methods allows
investigating the size of the confidence sets. For a small
number of taxa, P-values can be obtained for all possible
topologies. This becomes infeasible when the number of
trees increases, but approximate confidence sets can be
obtained by focusing on the trees with P-values above
some threshold during the heuristic search. In order to
evaluate and compare the sizes of the confidence sets
obtained with the GLS method and our computationally
simpler approach, we have constructed a database of
eight-species data sets of nucleotide sequences obtained
from EMBL-ALIGN [21]. Gaps and positions of doubtful
homology in the multiple alignments were removed using
Gblocks [22]; only alignments longer than 1000 nucleotides were kept: 108 out of 539 in the EMBL-ALIGN database.

Finding the data sets for which the GLS statistic could be
calculated proved to be a very difficult task. We iteratively
constructed eight-taxon subsets of each data set in the
EMBL-ALIGN database until we found a subset for which
the GLS statistic could be calculated. For many data sets,
such a subset could be found only after several thousands
of subsets were considered. Even so, it was necessary to
use the GLSDNA_EIG routine, which approximates the
GLS calculations when the covariance matrix has small
eigenvalues [18].
The Felsenstein84 [23] substitution model is the most
complex model in the available implementation of the
GLS method [13]. To avoid the problem of using an inappropriate substitution model, we considered only the data
sets for which the Akaike Information Criterion difference
from the model with the minimum AIC was less than 10
for the F84 model. The AIC difference was calculated
using ModelTest [24].
Table 2 shows the results for 16 data sets for which the
eigenvalue cutoff in GLS calculations was less than 10-10.
When the LS statistic was calculated using the WLS
approximation, the size of the confidence sets was always
smaller than the SH confidence set and, surprisingly,
often smaller than the GLS set. For one data set (7,
obtained from ALIGN_000623), the GLS test did not
reject any topology, while the WLS confidence set consisted of 33 trees. It is unlikely that this was caused by the
use of an inappropriate nucleotide substitution model:
indeed, the F84 model was judged optimal for this data

Aminoacid sequences were taken from six mammalian species: Homo sapiens (human), Phoca vitulina (seal), Bos taurus (cow) Oryctolagus cuniculus
(rabbit), Mus musculus (mouse), and Didelphis virginiana (opposum). The tree believed to be the best estimate of mammalian phylogeny [40] has been
underlined. Values in bold indicate the trees included in the 0.95 confidence set: the trees with the highest confidence levels which add up to 0.95
for the expected likelihood weights (ELW) test, and the trees with P-values above 0.05 for one-tailed Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) test, ShimodairaHasegawa (SH) test, generalised least squares (GLS) test, and weighted least squares test (WLS).

set according to the Akaike Information Criterion. When
both LS methods included all the possible topologies in
the confidence set, other pieces of evidence supported a
low phylogenetic signal in the data: Table 2 lists the percentage of four-taxon subsets for which the star topology
was the ML solution calculated using TREE-PUZZLE [25].
In general, we have observed that various methods gave
expected results (confidence sets larger for WLS than for
GLS, and closer to SH set size) when there was a large
number of site patterns in the alignment (data sets 1, 6, 9
and 12), even when the percent of unresolved quartets
was quite high (data set 1). However, it is not clear why
for some data sets WLS gave a much more smaller confidence set than GLS, as can be observed for the data set 13,
which is quite similar to 12 (for instance, the number of
site patterns was 45 and 41, respectively) or data set 2,

which is similar to 9 (both had 69 patterns). When the
number of site patterns was very low (14–20) and the
number of unresolved quartets extremely high (14, 15,
16), all tests gave similar results. It appears that larger confidence set for GLS than for WLS were observed especially
when the number of patterns was low (around 30) but the
high percentage of resolved quartets indicated good phylogenetic signal (data sets 5, 7 and 8). On the other hand,
both LS methods gave similar results when the phylogenetic signal was worse (3, 4, 10), with the exception of
data set 11.
The analysis of eight-species data sets discussed above
shows the limitations of the GLS approach when the covariance matrix is close to singular. Indeed, both in simulations (not shown) and for biological sequences obtained
from the EMBL-ALIGN database we observed that in

The sequences taken from each alignment are listed in the second column. ∆AIC values for the Felsenstein84 nucleotide substitution model were
calculated using PAUP* and ModelTest. The percentage of four-taxon subset for which the star topology was the ML solution (unresolved quartets)
was calculated using TreePuzzle. The last four columns show number of trees out of possible 10395 included in the 0.95 confidence set using:
expected likelihood weights (ELW) test, Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test, generalised least squares (GLS) test, and weighted least squares test
(WLS).

many cases the calculation of the GLS statistic was not
possible due to the singularity of the distance matrix. This
was especially pronounced when the sequences were relatively short.
The coverage of LS tree testing methods in simulations
Recent results of Shi et al. [26] indicated a strange behavior of the GLS test when the number of taxa increased in
simulations. In this previous study [26], sequences were
simulated over three ML topologies constructed from a
10-, 15- and 20-taxon subsets of a published 66-taxon tree
of placental mammals [27]. Shi et al. observed that for the
high number of taxa, although the number of trees
included in the GLS confidence set increased, the method
undercovered. The observed coverage of the 20-taxon tree
was only 0.84 for 95% confidence set [26], lower than the
lower bound for the nominal coverage, that is, the frequency in which the confidence set includes the true tree
(this is approximately 0.91–1 for 0.95 nominal coverage;
the
lower
bound
can
be
estimated
as

c − 1.645 c(1 − c)/100 for a given nominal coverage c
[26]).
In an effort to reproduce this simulation study, we have
used the same tree topologies (presented in Fig. 1), and
the same parameters for HKY substitution model (transi-

tion/transversion ratio 2.93, base frequencies A:0.37,
C:0.24, G:0.12, T:0.27) to simulate 3000-nt sequences
with EVOLVER (part of the PAML package [28]). To get
the measure of the size of confidence set, for each simulated data set we have tested 100 trees chosen from the
trees with the highest likelihood found by a heuristic
search with the nearest-neighbor interchange using
PAUP* [29]. The largest difference in log likelihood
among those trees was 506.4, 399.8, and 156.5 for 10-,
15- and 20-taxon trees, respectively. In other words, we
have chosen 100 trees from a larger spectrum of best trees
(which resulted in larger maximum differences in log likelihood) then just the best 100 trees found in the heuristic
search as in the previous study [26] (the maximum difference in log likelihood for the 100 best trees was 84.5 for
10-taxon trees, 46.1 for 15-taxon, but only 9.9 for 20taxon trees).
Table 3 shows that as the number of taxa increased, so did
the size of the confidence sets, for both the GLS and the
WLS test (and indeed the other tests we employed, SH and
ELW). This is expected, especially for the distance-based
methods, considering that the trees used in the simulation
have partially a star topology (many interior branches
close to 0; Fig. 1). The size of the WLS confidence set was
consistently larger than for the GLS test, indicating that
WLS is more conservative. As reported by Shi et al. [26],

however, was not observed for WLS, which always
included the true tree in the 0.95 confidence set (and also
in the 0.80 confidence set, not shown).

The test set consisted of 32 trees: the maximum likelihood
tree and 31 trees in which the clone sequences of each single local patient in the analysis were forced to form a
monophyletic clade with geographically unrelated
sequences not belonging to the outbreak. Following an
analogous reasoning to [31] and [32], if such tree is
included in the confidence set, then the patient can be
excluded from the outbreak, and vice versa: if this tree is
excluded, then the patient can be assigned to the outbreak. Table 4 shows which trees were included in the
confidence sets using the WLS method and the ELW, KH,
and SH tests.

Large data set of Hepatitis C Virus sequences
The next data set we considered consisted of 295 short
(532 nt) sequences obtained from 31 patients involved in
the analysis of a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) outbreak. This
data set could not be analyzed with the existing implementations of the GLS procedure, even using the
GLSDNA_EIG routine.

The sequences correspond to the E1–E2 region of the viral
genome, which includes the hypervariable region 1 and
codes for surface proteins. Out of 295 sequences under
analysis, 277 were derived from 23 patients presumably
involved in the outbreak, eight were from local controls
unrelated to the outbreak, and ten sequences were
obtained from external controls from different geographical origins. The TVM+Γ+I model (a restriction of the GTR
model in which the two transition rates are equal) was
used to calculate ML distances and branch lengths using
PAUP* [29] and TREE-PUZZLE [25]. This model was
found to be optimal according to the Akaike Information
Criterion [30] using Modeltest 3.6 [24].

As a reference we have used the results obtained in a more
detailed analysis (Bracho et al., in preparation) of an
expanded data set derived from the same patients, which
included clone sequences from the same E1–E2 region
and direct sequences from the Ns5b genomic region. This
analysis indicated that 18 of the 23 patients belonged to
the outbreak and allowed to identify three independent
transmission events, one involving 13 patients, and two
smaller transmission chains, with 3 and 2 patients, respectively. Using these results as a standard, all tests correctly
identified the isolates belonging to the 13-patient transmission chain (they correspond to the last 13 entries in

The data set consisted of 295 sequences corresponding to the E1–E2 region of the viral genome taken from 23 patients plus 8 local control (LC)
sequences of the same genotype (HCV-1b) taken from individuals unrelated to the outbreak. The results from a more detailed analysis with an
expanded data set were used to separate the 23 patients into four groups: EO, excluded from the outbreak; O1, involved in the outbreak,
transmission chain 1; O2, involved in transmission chain 2; and O3, involved in transmission chain 3. The test set consisted of 32 trees, the ML tree
and 31 trees in which the sequences from each patient where moved to form a monophyletic group with the external controls. For each alternative
topology the probability associated to the corresponding test statistic (see abbreviations in Table 1) is shown. Topologies included in the confidence
set around the ML tree at the 0.05 level (bold) are indicated. For WLS, the value of the corresponding statistic is shown between parentheses.

Table 4, denoted by prefix O3-), because in all cases the
modified tree was excluded from the confidence set of
trees. Out of the 5 additional isolates also belonging to the
outbreak according to the reference analysis (identified by
prefixes O1- and O2- in Table 4), two (O2–60 and O2–
29) were identified by all tests as belonging to the outbreak, one (O1–69) was excluded from the outbreak by
SH and WLS tests, while the remaining two patient isolates (O1–00 and O2–61) were excluded from the outbreak only by the WLS test. On the other hand, the ELW
and KH tests both assigned to the outbreak several local
control patients and also patients which were judged
external by the reference analysis (EO-12 and EO-95).

This suggests that although the ELW and KH are more
powerful, their results are less reliable since they erroneously include in the outbreak patients which do not
belong to it according to other evidence.
We note that WLS shows P-values close either to zero or
one, which at first may be striking. The explanation is
quite simple. The number of branch lengths grows linearly with the number of species in a bifurcating tree, and
the number of distances is quadratic with the number of
species, and so is the number of degrees of freedom of the
chi-square distribution. The consequences can be
observed in Fig. 2, which shows the shape of the chi-

square distribution for 42778 degrees of freedom and
makes clear that the values very close to zero or one would
be observed for any LS test procedure.
DNA/DNA hybridization data
The advantage of LS methods for tree reconstruction is not
only their high computational efficiency but also that the
data need not to be characters: distances that are not
derived directly from sequences can also be used for tree
reconstruction. Also, occasionally access to the original
character data derived from sequences is not possible;
only distance methods can be used in such conditions.
The WLS method of topology testing could also be used
for such data provided that the variances are known or can
be estimated. One example of such data is DNA/DNA
hybridization data.

The data set we will use here as an example was originally
obtained by Marshall and Swift [33] using four species of
sand dollars: Dendraster excentricus (Eschscholtz) (De),
Echinarachnius parma (Lamarck) (Ep), Leodia sexiesperforata
(Leske) (Ls), and Mellita spp. (Mt), with sea biscuit
Clypeaster rosaceus (Linne) (Cr) as outgroup. This is a high
quality data set of DNA/DNA hybridization data;
although the normalized percent hybridization (NPH)
values were all below 50%, the values were highly reproducible [33], and the data reported in the original paper
included the variances for two distances measures: 1/NPH
(the averaged inverses of normalized percent hybridization), and ∆Tm (the averaged differences in melting temperatures), corrected for multiple substitutions using the
Jukes-Cantor [34] formula. All 15 possible five-species
trees were considered using the WLS test; Fig. 3 shows the
results, compared with the bootstrap [16]. Both methods
rejected 12 topologies that were not shown in the figure.
For the 1/NPH distances, only one tree belongs to the WLS
0.95 confidence set, the bootstrap confidence set included
one additional topology. Both methods gave similar
results also for the ∆Tm data: three (WLS) or two (bootstrap) topologies. The quality of the regression used to calculate the two parameters necessary for the calculation of
the WLS statistic was not as good as is routinely observed
for sequence data (where regression coefficients are often
close to 0.99): R2 was 0.79 for the 1/NPH data, but only
0.22 for the ∆Tm data. However, when the whole variance
matrix was used in the calculations (instead of using only
regression parameters to calculate the WLS statistic), the
sizes of WLS 0.95 confidence sets did not change (not
shown).

Discussion
Distance methods for tree inference have the advantage
that they can be used when the distances are not derived
from characters or when there is no access to the original
sequence data. When the data are sequences, using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/105

distance matrix unavoidably results in some loss of information. This leads to reduced statistical power compared
to character-based methods such as maximum likelihood
or Bayesian methods of tree reconstruction, the advantage
being a much higher computational efficiency, an important issue for very large data sets. Contrary to maximum
parsimony, distance methods have been shown to be consistent, and they usually are as accurate as maximum likelihood methods [35]. In particular, the least squares (LS)
criterion is well-established both for phylogenetic reconstruction [12,15,36-38] and hypothesis testing [12,13].
Simulation studies [35,38] have shown that the WLS
method is accurate and consistent for tree inference.
Both GLS and WLS are based on the assumption that distances are normally distributed. Although it has been traditionally considered that this assumption is not fulfilled
for distances derived from nucleotide or amino acid
sequences [39], more recent work [13] showed that provided the distances are maximum likelihood estimates,
their distribution is approximately multivariate normal,
which led to the proposal of a GLS test for topologies. The
LS method is applicable to distance measures not necessarily derived from sequence data, but whenever it is reasonable to assume normality of the distances. What
makes the WLS test different from the GLS is that distances
are considered independent for computational reasons.
Although the phylogenetic distances are not independent
because taxa share common evolutionary history, our previous results suggest that this does not affect the performance of the WLS method for branch testing [6].
In this work we have investigated the applicability of LS
methods for topology testing and the consequences of
using the WLS approximation. To compare our method to
previously proposed procedures, we first restrict the discussion to examples in which the distances were derived
from sequences and the variances estimated by bootstrapping. However, the WLS method is applicable for testing
topological hypotheses and for finding confidence sets of
trees as long as the distance matrices and at least some of
the variances associated with the distances are known. The
distances may, for example, be derived from DNA-DNA
hybridization assays, or result from averaging different
data sets.
The first data set we considered, that of mammalian mitochondrial proteins, has gained a de facto benchmarking
status, and has been discussed in a number of previous
studies [3,8,10,11,13]. In these studies, restricting the
number of topologies supported by the data was at least
implicitly considered desirable. Taking into account that
various methods give different answers and that the topology believed to be the best estimate [40] is not included in
the 0.95 confidence set by the ELW and KH tests, it might

nor
the
Approximate

test
[3,8,10,11,13]. However, erroneous rejections in the analyses of real data may be caused by bias, not only because
the confidence sets are too radical. Although conservative
confidence sets may be useful in face of unrecognized
biases (the models of molecular evolution are inevitably
too simple), it is hard to investigate the effects of biased
estimates on the performance of various methods.
One way around this problem is to investigate the performance of the methods using simulated data. In the case
of our simulations, the number of possible sources of bias
was diminished (for example, the substitution model
used to simulate the data was used also when testing, and
no heterogeneity among the sites was introduced). The
disadvantage is, of course, that the method that performs
best in simulations may not necessarily work well in real
data analysis. Therefore, we first investigated the size of
confidence sets for topologies obtained with real data:
eight-taxon nucleotide data sets from the EMBL-ALIGN
database. The results were somewhat surprising. The WLS

confidence sets were always smaller than the SH sets and,
what is more surprising, in the majority of cases smaller
than the confidence sets obtained using the GLS method.
Perhaps numerical errors or errors in the GLS implementation may account for these rather unexpected outcomes,
although it appears that such discrepancies may occur
principally when the number of site patterns in the
sequence alignment is low. For simulated data, strange
behavior of the GLS method has been previously reported
[26]: the true tree was included in the confidence set rarer
than expected, especially as the number of taxa in the trees
increased. This behavior was observed even though the
number of trees included in the confidence set grew larger
with the increase of the number of taxa for the topology
used in the simulations (close to the star tree). In the same
simulations, WLS always included the true tree in the confidence set, which is an expected conservative behavior
considering on the one hand the construction of the test
and on the other the topology of the trees.
When the number of taxa is very large, the fact that P-values are being indistinguishable either from zero or from
one may at first look striking. This problem is not a result

Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:105

of the computational differences between WLS and GLS,
but rather the shape of the chi-square density distribution
(Fig. 2). Therefore, the GLS method would also result in
extreme P-values, if it could be applied to the HCV data
set, for which the covariance matrix was very close to singular due to the presence of very closely related sequences.
The covariance matrix may be non-invertible for two reasons: the variance of one or more distances is practically
zero or the correlations between the distances are
(almost) perfect. Both conditions are related and occur
when the data set includes very closely related taxa: small
distances would have very small variances, and the distances between these taxa and the other OTUs would be
highly correlated (and thus far from being independent).
In fact, both conditions also affect the WLS statistic; in the
first case, this is caused by division by values very close to
zero (the computation of the WLS statistic involves division by variance). However, the results obtained with WLS
for the HCV data set were reasonable. This might be due
to an over-estimation of small variances. Since in theory
the true variances should be used, the WLS statistic would
be smaller (after division by a larger value) and the test
more conservative. Indeed, in the HCV-1b E1–E2 example
the WLS test gave more conservative estimation of the tree
confidence set than the SH test. However, the comparison
with the results obtained from an independent analysis
indicates that these results were reliable.
A result which might strike as paradoxical is the rejection
of all the possible topologies by LS methods, rarely
observed for short sequences, but unavoidable for very
long sequences, both real and simulated (our unpublished observations). This may occur because a particular
data set indeed cannot be fitted to a tree (and would be
better represented by a network). However, as the number
of characters increases, the variance decreases, leading to
the rejection of all the hypotheses. Indeed, it is well
known that P-values are dependent on sample size [41],
and that one can always reject a null hypothesis with a
large enough sample, even if the true difference is trivial
(the so called Lindley's [42] paradox).

Conclusion
In this work, we have explored the limitations of LS methods for phylogeny testing. The advantage of these methods is their high computational efficiency, which allows
their application to very large data sets. We have proposed
a way to approximate the value of the test statistic (the
WLS method) which requires only a matrix of distances
and at least some of the variances. In principle, this allows
the application of the method for data sets in which the
distances are not derived directly from sequences (or for
which the sequence data is not available). We have shown
the applicability of the method to such data (DNA-DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/105

hybridization data set), but only by considering sequence
data we have been able to compare the results of the WLS
method to other methods for construction of tree confidence sets, including the GLS method. We believe that
none of these methods is free from limitations, and the
fact that in practical applications various tests give contradictory results has been noticed previously [10,11]. This
results in an uncomfortable situation because it is not very
difficult to simulate data in such a way that they show the
superiority of a particular test over others and, in which by
choosing either a 'more conservative' or 'less conservative'
test, one can accept or reject a particular topological
hypothesis.
The results obtained with the WLS method we present are
reasonable in the sense that they are similar to the results
obtained with other tests. This cannot be said of the available implementation of the GLS method: firstly, for many
real data sets the test statistic cannot be calculated. It is difficult to say if the second problem (all the trees in the confidence set in spite of a strong phylogenetic signal) is or
not caused by errors in the implementation. The WLS
method we propose is computationally very efficient and
is not restricted to a particular substitution model. It may
be useful to assess the phylogenetic signal in the data, and
to screen out the hypotheses which are likely to be rejected
by more powerful tests or when few alternatives are available (as in the DNA-DNA hybridization example).

Methods
It has been shown [13] that provided the distances
derived from sequences satisfy the maximum likelihood
criterion, their distribution is approximately multivariate
normal, which allows to estimate their variances and covariances using the sample average method [13]. Under the
null hypothesis that a given topology is true, the GLS statistic (eq. 1) follows the chi-square distribution [13]. The
number of degrees of freedom corresponds to the number
of entries in the distance matrix minus the number of
branches estimated in the tree. If the tree is fully bifurcating and incorporates T entries, this corresponds to T(T 1)/2 - (2T - 3). Calculating the GLS statistic and then the
corresponding P-values from the chi-square distribution
allows to sort a set of competing topologies and to establish confidence sets for topologies. In other words, as long
as the estimates of the entries in the covariance matrix are
consistent, provided that the number of sites is large, over
the long run the P-values corresponding to true topologies
will be larger than the significance threshold α, and the
true topologies will be included in the confidence sets in
a fraction (1-α) of the analyses.
However, this reasoning assumes that both the distances
and the variances are well-estimated. Even if the estimation method is consistent, in practice the number of sites

may not be large enough for the estimates to be precise.
Using an inappropriate substitution model may lead to
bias. Finally, estimating a large numbers of parameters
(covariances) from limited data may lead to large errors in
the estimates.
Additionally, some data sets present particular computational problems. When the distance matrix is large and
contains closely related taxa, the covariance matrix may be
close to singularity [6]. Ignoring very small entries in the
matrix leads to a more conservative test (the test statistic is
smaller, which results in higher P-values). In the extreme,
when all the covariances are ignored, the computational
problems associated with inverting the covariance matrix
are avoided, which leads to the WLS statistic. We have previously presented a further simplification of the WLS
approach in which only two parameters were used instead
of T(T-1)/2 variances of distances between T taxa [6].

Implementation
The program WeightLESS [6], originally written to allow
for interior branch testing using the WLS likelihood ratio
test, has been modified to calculate also the P-values corresponding to each topology in the tree input file. The distances between taxa are input in a separate file. The user
may provide the two parameters necessary for the calculation of the WLS statistic or they can be estimated by the
program if many distance matrices are provided (again, in
a separate file). For sequence data, this file may be constructed by calculating pseudo distance matrices using
bootstrapping. Alternatively, the whole variance matrix
can be used in the calculations. The program (the C source
code, the documentation, and binaries for Linux and
DOS/Windows) is available at the author's webpage [43].
