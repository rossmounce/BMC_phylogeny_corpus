Abstract
Background: Detailed comparative genome analyses within the economically important Rosaceae
family have not been conducted. This is largely due to the lack of conserved gene-based molecular
markers that are transferable among the important crop genera within the family [e.g. Malus
(apple), Fragaria (strawberry), and Prunus (peach, cherry, apricot and almond)]. The lack of
molecular markers and comparative whole genome sequence analysis for this family severely
hampers crop improvement efforts as well as QTL confirmation and validation studies.
Results: We identified a set of 3,818 rosaceaous unigenes comprised of two or more ESTs that
correspond to single copy Arabidopsis genes. From this Rosaceae Conserved Orthologous Set
(RosCOS), 1039 were selected from which 857 were used for the development of intron-flanking
primers and allele amplification. This led to successful amplification and subsequent mapping of 613
RosCOS onto the Prunus TxE reference map resulting in a genome-wide coverage of 0.67 to 1.06
gene-based markers per cM per linkage group. Furthermore, the RosCOS primers showed
amplification success rates from 23 to 100% across the family indicating that a substantial part of
the RosCOS primers can be directly employed in other less studied rosaceaous crops.
Comparisons of the genetic map positions of the RosCOS with the physical locations of the
orthologs in the Populus trichocarpa genome identified regions of colinearity between the genomes
of Prunus-Rosaceae and Populus-Salicaceae.
Conclusion: Conserved orthologous genes are extremely useful for the analysis of genome
evolution among closely and distantly related species. The results presented in this study
demonstrate the considerable potential of the mapped Prunus RosCOS for genome-wide marker
employment and comparative whole genome studies within the Rosaceae family. Moreover, these
markers will also function as useful anchor points for the genome sequencing efforts currently
ongoing in this family as well as for comparative QTL analyses.

Background
The Rosaceae is an important plant family that includes
more than 90 genera and 3000 species. The family
belongs to the Rosid clade and is closely related to the Salicaceae (including poplar), Leguminoseae (including
Medicago and soybean), Cucurbitaceae (including cucumber and melon) and more distantly related to the Brassicaceae (including Arabidopsis). The Rosaceae is divided
into three subfamilies, two of which include some of the
most economically important temperate fruit crops [1].
The largest subfamily is the Spiraoideae to which Malus
(apple), Pyrus (pear) and Prunus (peach, cherry, almond,
apricot) belong. The second largest subfamily is the Rosoideae to which Fragaria (strawberry), Rubus (currants,
blackberries, raspberries) and Rosa (rose) belong. Within
the family, apple, peach and strawberry have been utilized
as model species for Rosaceae biology, genetics and
genomics [2].
Comparative analyses of plant genomes offer insights into
genome evolution and speciation of closely as well as
more distantly related species. In particular, knowledge of
the extent and locations of syntenic blocks and chromosomal rearrangements enables the transfer of genomic
information among species. This information would aid
genome-wide as well as targeted marker development for
the identification and validation of loci controlling traits
that are important for crop improvement. Without the
availability of several sequenced plant genomes within
one family, comparative analyses often rely on molecular
markers that are shared among the species. One of the earliest efforts towards the construction of comparative plant
maps using molecular markers was conducted in the
Solanaceae family. Assessment of the degree of similarity
between tomato and pepper [3,4] and tomato and potato
[5] show that the more closely related species, tomato and
potato, underwent fewer rearrangements compared to the
more distantly related tomato and pepper. Similarly in the
Poaceae family, conservation of large chromosomal
regions between wheat, barley and rye genomes have been
identified [6,7]. The application of comparative sequence
analysis within the grasses greatly facilitated the positional cloning of important genes such as VRN1 from
wheat, a species for which map-based cloning was
deemed impossible due to its large genome size and the
presence of many repetitive elements that would hamper
chromosome walking efforts [8].
Despite the lack of extensive investigations, the potential
for comparative genome analysis within the Rosaceae
family has been demonstrated by several studies. Genome
colinearity was found among Prunus species [9-16]. These
comparative studies were based on the Prunus reference
map (x = 8), the most detailed genetic map in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/562

Rosaceae, that is derived from an interspecific almond (P.
dulcis) cv. Texas × peach (P. persica) cv. Earlygold (abbreviation TxE) F2 mapping population [10]. Good colinearity and marker transferability within the family was also
demonstrated by the identification of syntenic regions of
the Malus and Prunus genomes [9,17], and between the
more distant genera Prunus and Fragaria [18,19]. However, a comprehensive and extensive comparative map
such as those that were constructed in the Solanaceae and
Poaceae families has not been achieved for the Rosaceae.
This is mostly due to the lack of conserved markers to
apply across the entire family [12,18].
Genes that are highly conserved and are present as low or
single copy in genomes are particularly useful as markers
for genome evolution studies as well as whole genome
comparative analyses [20,17]. A Conserved Ortholog Set
(COS) is defined as a collection of genes that are conserved in sequence and copy number throughout plant
evolution [20]. In contrast, paralogs represent duplicated
regions within the genome as a result of single gene duplications and/or large scale polyploidization events [21].
The development of markers from single copy and conserved genes is critical in comparative mapping studies as
these markers enable an unambiguous determination of
the degree of synteny [22]. In addition, the single copy
conserved genes reduce the possibility of erroneously
identifying chromosomal rearrangements that could
result from mapping paralogous genes [23].
Complete whole-genome sequence information of model
plants together with improved genomic resources from
other species, such as EST databases, provide the opportunity for the in silico identification of candidate COS. Using
the Arabidopsis whole genome sequence and the EST
databases of potato, tomato and pepper, Wu et al identified 2869 Solanaceaous COS [21]. Likewise, a universal
set of COS markers was developed for the Asteraceae family after comparing EST from sunflower and lettuce
against the whole genome of Arabidopsis [24]. Moreover,
comparative genome sequence analysis between the three
sequenced model species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa
and Populus trichocarpa resulted in the identification of
753 COS candidates among the angiosperms of which 55
to 359 could be identified from pairwise comparisons
among four gymnosperm EST databases [25]. Once developed, COS markers have been widely employed to link
the genomes of related species within families [20,26-29]
In this study, we report the first step towards a comprehensive and dense comparative genetic map for rosaceous
species. We present the development of a set of conserved
Rosaceae gene-based sequences corresponding to single
copy Arabidopsis genes. These Rosaceae COS (RosCOS)

were subsequently mapped using the bin map population
corresponding to the Prunus TxE reference map [10,30].
Our analyses show that nearly all of the mapped RosCOS
are present once in the Prunus genome suggesting that this
genus did not undergo a hitherto unknown recent polyploidization event. Additionally, we compared the genetic
location of these RosCOS to the physical location of the
poplar and Arabidopsis orthologs. These analyses identified many regions that exhibited synteny between Prunus
and poplar and to a lesser extent to Arabidopsis.

Results and Discussion
Construction of the RosCOS set
The Rosaceae ESTs that were publicly available as of
December 2007 were used to construct the set of COS. The
highest numbers of available Rosaceae ESTs were from
Malus, Prunus and Fragaria, totaling up to 97.6% of all
Rosaceae ESTs (Table 1). After comparing these ESTs to
Arabidopsis single copy genes, we identified 30,801 putative orthologs (Figure 1). The CAP3 assembly of these
ESTs resulted in 7,247 unigenes corresponding to 2,324
single copy Arabidopsis genes. Of these, 3,818 were contigs comprised of at least two ESTs and 3,429 were singletons. On average, the number of unigenes corresponded
to 3.1 Rosaceae putative COS per Arabidopsis single copy
gene. When we compared the distribution among contigs
versus the singletons and the mixture of contigs and singletons, the majority of Arabidopsis single copy genes was
represented by up to three Rosaceae unigenes (Figure 2).
Also, the data showed that a significant number of the
Arabidopsis single copy genes were represented by singletons indicating the lack of sufficiently deep EST data in the
Rosaceae to permit assembly into contigs. The apparent
redundancy in this unigene dataset is likely due to: 1)
ESTs corresponding to the same gene but aligning to different parts of the gene, 2) sufficient nucleotide divergence within the Rosaceae EST from different species such
that CAP3 would not allow them to be assembled into the
same unigene, 3) errors in cloning, sequencing, as well as
alternative splicing. Further investigation into the unigene
duplicates is provided below.

Due to single pass sequencing of EST clones, the chance of
sequencing errors can be considerable. In an effort to
avoid the design of primers in regions of poor sequence
quality, we focused on the 3,818 unigenes that were represented by at least two ESTs. Moreover, contigs tended to
have more sequence information (i.e. longer sequences)
which was helpful in the design of primers flanking the
predicted intron sites. Each contig was named RosCOS### to indicate that this was the set of putatively conserved orthologous Rosaceae sequences. We narrowed the
collection down further by selecting RosCOS that were
represented by at least two of the three key genera in the
family or Prunus alone (see Additional file 1). This selection was chosen to enhance the chance of successful
amplification of Prunus DNA with the designed primers
because of our goal to map these RosCOS on the Prunus
reference map. The reduction led to the final data set of
1,039 RosCOS (Figure 1). We noticed that contigs harboring ESTs from more than one genus usually exhibited a
higher number of mismatches in Fragaria than in Malus or
Prunus which is consistent with the greater phylogenetic
distance between Fragaria and the other two genera [1].
Amplification and mapping of RosCOS in Prunus
Of the 1,039 RosCOS, 857 were selected for the design of
intron-flanking primers because their sequences covered
at least one putative intron (Figure 3). These primers were
used to amplify the corresponding region from the TxE
peach parent 'Earlygold', the F1, and the Prunus bin map
set that consisted of six F2 individuals. Amplification success and mapping ability was evaluated, which demonstrated that 91% of the primers amplified Prunus DNA of
which only 10% were monomorphic (Table 2). The percentage of RosCOS that exhibited only one SNP was 18%
whereas 43% harbored at least 2 SNPs. A total of 39% of
the polymorphic RosCOS contained at least one InDel
(see Additional file 2 for detailed information about each
RosCOS).

A total of 613 RosCOS were assigned to 63 of the 67 Prunus bins (Figure 4). This included six RosCOS for which

the position could not be conclusively identified. For
these six, the 'Earlygold' parent and F1 were both heterozygous as were all the F2 progeny individuals (Table 2).
The heterozygous genotype found for all six F2 plants
comprising the bin population is indicative of the position on the top of linkage group 4. Therefore, we tentatively placed these six RosCOS with the other RosCOS in
bin 4:18 (Figure 4). However, it was also possible that
these RosCOS represented recent gene duplications as was
observed in a few other cases (Howad and Arus, unpubl).
In addition, some RosCOS were clearly polymorphic but
could not be assigned to an existing bin. The 36 unbinned
RosCOS were termed "orphan COS" of which 17 grouped
in four distinct bins. The fact that several orphan COS
clustered together suggested that these bins correctly represent the Prunus genome; however, the genomic location
is unknown. Only 1% of the RosCOS exhibited ambiguous segregation due to difficulty in scoring the SNPs and
associated double peaks in the chromatograms. Six per-

cent of the sequencing reactions failed, indicating the
overall high quality of the sequence data (Table 2). In all,
the average marker density per centimorgan (cM) ranged
from 0.67 to 1.06 for the eight Prunus chromosomes
(Table 3). Marker density within bins ranged from 0.2 to
18 per cM which might be indicative of regions of low and
high recombination frequencies, respectively.
The marker density per linkage group is high and could be
inflated due to the fact that one single copy Arabidopsis
gene is represented by, on average, 3.1 Rosaceae unigenes
(see above). Among the mapped RosCOS, we noted that
55 Arabidopsis single copy genes corresponded to two or
more RosCOS (Table 4, see Additional file 3). Importantly, five of the 55 putatively duplicated Arabidopsis
single copy genes mapped to different positions in the
Prunus genome, indicating that at least some genes were
duplicated in Prunus while they were single copy in Arabidopsis (Table 4). The remaining 50 putatively duplicated

genes mapped to the same bin which implied that these
could have been derived from one Rosaceae conserved
gene (see Additional file 3). To further address this possibility, a closer examination of the CAP3 assembly of the
50 single copy Arabidopsis genes with more than one RosCOS representative revealed that in 36 cases these RosCOS corresponded to the same region of the Arabidopsis
single copy gene. The reason that these unigenes were not
assembled into one RosCOS appeared to stem from the
fact that the overlapping region was too short and/or too
divergent to ensure the assembling into one RosCOS. It is
therefore likely that these RosCOS correspond to a single

Rosaceae conserved gene and are not the result of gene
duplication. For the remaining 14 putatively duplicated
Arabidopsis single copy genes, the corresponding RosCOS
did not overlap with the same region of the Arabidopsis
gene. Therefore, whether these RosCOS corresponded to
the same gene or a tandemly duplicated gene pair could
not be determined with the present data. However,
despite the evidence of a few duplicated genes, which may
have occurred after the divergence of Arabidopsis-Brassicaceae and Rosaceae or represent gene loss in Arabidopsis,
these data strongly support the evidence for the lack of a
recent large scale genome duplication event in Prunus.

Synteny between Rosaceae, Arabidopsis and Populus
The availability of the Arabidopsis and poplar genomes
allowed us to determine the level of synteny among these
species and Prunus. Because gene annotation is more complete for Arabidopsis than any other plant species, the
translated Arabidopsis single copy genes corresponding to

RosCOS that mapped to the same TxE bin were searched
against the translated poplar genome using the TBLASTN
function. After identifying the location in poplar of RosCOS that mapped together in Prunus, we found several
syntenic regions between these genomes (Figure 5).
Importantly, the mapping of the poplar COS confirmed

nearly all the previously reported homeologous gene
blocks shared by two poplar chromosomes presumed to
have arisen from the most recent salicoid wide-genome
duplication event [31]. For instance, RosCOS that
mapped in the TxE bin 1:34 confirmed duplicated blocks
of poplar linkage groups 1 and 3 (Figure 5A). The high
level of synteny between poplar and Prunus as well as the
conservation of gene order in paralogous regions of the
poplar genome strongly supported the potential of the
RosCOS for comparative mapping across the Rosaceae
family. These results also suggested that the order of the
RosCOS in the Rosaceae can be predicted based on their
order in poplar, although this would have to be confirmed
by genome sequence analysis or higher resolution genetic
mapping. The size of the syntenic blocks was defined as

large (more than seven RosCOS corresponding to poplar
orthologs in a 2 Mb region), medium (harboring five to
six RosCOS) and small (harboring three to four RosCOS).
As a result, we identified six large syntenic blocks represented by bins 1:73, 8:41, 8:60, and the adjoining bins
5:21 and 5:41; 6:65 and 6:74; and 6:80 and 6:84. In addition, 21 medium and 20 small syntenic blocks were also
observed (Figure 5).
We also analyzed the number of RosCOS that mapped to
the same Prunus bin and their corresponding position in
the Arabidopsis genome. The data indicated that the Arabidopsis -Prunus synteny blocks tended to be smaller compared to the size of the Populus-Prunus blocks (Figure 6).
For example, most of the blocks in Arabidopsis had only

three RosCOS within a 2 Mb interval whereas most of the
blocks in poplar had five RosCOS within a 2 Mb interval.
This result suggested that the order of the Prunus RosCOS
is less conserved with that of Arabidopsis compared to
poplar. This is an expected finding since Arabidopsis is
more distantly related to Rosaceae than is poplar and is
consistent with previous findings [32].
Amplification of RosCOS across the Rosaceae
The transferability of molecular markers across different
species is an important feature of conserved orthologous
sequences in addition to the common ancestry these
sequences represent. To explore the applicability of RosCOS markers in other rosaceous crops, a subset of the RosCOS primers was employed to amplify Malus, Prunus and
Fragaria DNA. Malus and Prunus are phylogenetically
closer than Fragaria as the former two belong to the same
subfamily (Table 1). Despite the larger distance and the

multiple SNP between the species, using EST information
from all three genera enabled the development of primers
that resulted in successful amplification of more than half
of the RosCOS in each genus (Table 5). Amplification failures were likely due to the difficulty in designing primers
with less than two mismatches in all three genera and
presence of a large intron. The amplification success rate
remained approximately the same when only two genera
contributed to the RosCOS. However, when a RosCOS
was represented by two genera, the lowest amplification
was observed in the genus for which no EST contributed
to the RosCOS. Yet, even when only Prunus EST information is used, the amplification success rate was 77% in
Malus and 23% in Fragaria. In general, it is evident from
these data that successful amplification across all genera is
enhanced when EST from two genera contributed to the
RosCOS and primer design.

Conclusion
Comparative genome analysis for the Rosaceae family lags
behind that of other economically important families
such as the Solanaceae and Poaceae. The RosCOS resource
developed in this study aims to ameliorate this situation
by providing a marker set that can be employed for comparative mapping and marker development as well as
whole genome comparative analyses in the Rosaceae family. The extensive colinearity observed between poplar
and Prunus demonstrates the possibility of additional
marker development in targeted regions of the Prunus
genome based on synteny with poplar. Moreover, with
the advent of Rosaceae species whole genome sequence
information that will become available in the near future,
these RosCOS will be instrumental to place unlinked scaffolds onto genetic maps and enable marker development
to targeted regions in species whose genome is not
sequenced. Excellent genetic maps and whole genome
sequence data are extremely important for QTL discovery
and validation. Therefore, the RosCOS resource developed herein has great potential to benefit rosaceaous crop
improvement.

Methods
Identification of the Rosaceae COS (RosCOS) set
The set of 3,790 Arabidopsis single copy genes was
selected as previously described [33]. The complete data
set of 412,827 Rosaceae ESTs as of December 2007 was
downloaded from NCBI GenBank [34] and compared to
the Arabidopsis single copy gene set using the BLASTX
function at the cutoff E-value of 1e-15. The resulting
Rosaceae ESTs were assembled using the Contig Assembly
Program: CAP3 [35] with parameters of at least 80 bp
overlap and 90% sequence identity. This resulted in the
assembly of 7,247 unigenes (3,818 contigs and 3,429 singletons) (Figure 1). The 3,818 contigs were assigned a
RosCOS number whereas the singletons were not. The
consensus sequence for each RosCOS is found under the
name ROSC_FMLY_CSA1_1 beginning with RosCOS 1
[36]. The ESTs that are part of the RosCOS are found in the
"December 2007 Assembly Info" [37]. The list of single
copy Arabidopsis genes and corresponding RosCOS are
found under the "December 2007 BLAST info" links [37].
Information about the final list of RosCOS used in this
study can be found under the "RosCOS final selection and
QC BLAST" links [37]. RosCOS map and primer data is
also available from our own database [38] as well as in
Additional file 2. Sequence data of the peach parent 'Earlygold' has been deposited in GSS at Genbank [34] and
the corresponding accession numbers are listed in Additional file 2 (sheet 2).
Design of PCR primers flanking introns
Orthologous genes share conserved structures such that
the position of the introns is conserved [39]. To reduce the
probability of sequencing errors in the ESTs and to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/562

increase the amplification success rate in multiple
Rosaceae species, singletons were discarded from the analysis. Rosaceae contigs comprised of ESTs from three (Fragaria, Malus and Prunus) and two (Fragaria-Malus, PrunusFragaria, and Malus-Prunus) genera as well as only Prunus
ESTs were selected totaling up to 1,039 RosCOS that were
further investigated. The RosCOS were aligned to the Arabidopsis genome and putative intron sites were identified
using the Python Contig Viewer program [40] (Figure 3).
Based on the RosCOS sequence length and predicted
intron position of these 1039 RosCOS, 857 intron-flanking primer pairs were developed using Primer3 v0.4.0
[41]. Subsequently, all forward primers were designed
with an additional M13 tail (CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC) at the 5' end to facilitate high-throughput direct
sequencing of the amplicons.
PCR conditions and polymorphism detection of RosCOS
The RosCOS putative intron-flanking primers were used
to amplify the peach parent 'Earlygold', F1 and 6 bin set
individuals selected from the Prunus TxE F2 reference population [10,30]. The amplification reactions were conducted in 96-well plate format in 60 ul reaction volume
consisting of 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM
MgCl2, 10-100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.1 mM of each
dNTP, 0.1 uM of each primer, and 0.25 U Taq polymerase.
The reactions were preheated at 94°C for 1 min followed
by 31 cycles of 92°C (30 s), 56°C (30 s), 72°C (30 s), and
a final extension of 72°C (60 s). Amplified fragments
were sequenced using the M13F primer at the Agencourt
Bioscience Corporation (Agencourt, Beverly, MA, USA).
The sequencing results were analyzed for polymorphisms
such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and/or
insertion-deletions (InDels) using Sequencher software
v4.2 (Gene Codes Corporation). The presence of a double
peak in an otherwise high-quality chromatogram was
indicative of the presence of a SNP. The sudden decay of
high-quality chromatogram was indicative of the presence
of an InDel.
Genotyping and Mapping
Bins representing the different regions of the Prunus
genome have been identified by the genotype of a subset
of plants from the TxE F2 population [30]. RosCOS markers with a segregation pattern corresponding to a bin set
score were grouped in that bin. RosCOS that mapped in
bin 2:45 or 3:04 and 5:41 or 8:30, respectively, were analyzed in a 7th genotype to map them in one or the other
bin. RosCOS markers that clearly segregated but did not
fall into a known bin were categorized as "orphan" RosCOS markers.
Synteny of RosCOS and Poplar COS
The translated sequence of Arabidopsis single copy genes
corresponding to the bin-mapped RosCOS were compared to the Populus trichocarpa genome. Using the P. triPage 10 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:562

chocarpa v1.1 genome browser [42], the physical position
of each poplar COS was identified through the TBLASTN
function with the cut off E-value of 1e-5. Syntenic blocks
between Prunus and poplar were established under the
condition that a minimum of three linked RosCOS corresponded to poplar COS that were located within 2 Mb
from each other.
