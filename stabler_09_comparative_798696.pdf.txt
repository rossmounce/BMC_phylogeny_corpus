Abstract
Background: The continued rise of Clostridium difficile infections worldwide has been accompanied
by the rapid emergence of a highly virulent clone designated PCR-ribotype 027. To understand
more about the evolution of this virulent clone, we made a three-way genomic and phenotypic
comparison of an 'historic' non-epidemic 027 C. difficile (CD196), a recent epidemic and
hypervirulent 027 (R20291) and a previously sequenced PCR-ribotype 012 strain (630).
Results: Although the genomes are highly conserved, the 027 genomes have 234 additional genes
compared to 630, which may contribute to the distinct phenotypic differences we observe between
these strains relating to motility, antibiotic resistance and toxicity. The epidemic 027 strain has five
unique genetic regions, absent from both the non-epidemic 027 and strain 630, which include a
novel phage island, a two component regulatory system and transcriptional regulators.
Conclusions: A comparison of a series of 027 isolates showed that some of these genes appeared
to have been gained by 027 strains over the past two decades. This study provides genetic markers
for the identification of 027 strains and offers a unique opportunity to explain the recent emergence
of a hypervirulent bacterium.

Background

Clostridium difficile, a spore-forming anaerobic bacillus that
often resides in the gut of mammals, is the causative agent of
C. difficile infection (CDI) (reviewed in [1]). The hospital

environment and patients undergoing antibiotic treatment
provide a discrete ecosystem where C. difficile persists and
selected virulent clones thrive. Consequently, C. difficile is the
most frequent cause of nosocomial diarrhea worldwide,

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R102

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/9/R102

Genome Biology 2009,

where patients exhibit a range of symptoms from mild
diarrhea to life threatening pseudomembranous colitis
(PMC) [2,3]. In most cases of CDI antibiotic therapies disrupt
the protective gut microbiota, whereupon ingested or existent
C. difficile spores germinate, colonize the gastrointestinal
tract and produce toxins. Another feature of CDI is the high
relapse rate due to re-infection or reactivation of infection
[2,3]. The population at risk for CDI includes not only
patients on antimicrobial and other therapies that can alter
the balance of the gut microbiota (for example, antacid/proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs), but also the immunocompromised and the elderly.
Given the continued use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and
the rising numbers of immunocompromised and elderly
patients, the problems associated with CDI are unlikely to
recede.
Alarmingly, in the past 5 years a new group of highly virulent
C. difficile strains has emerged to cause outbreaks of
increased disease severity in North America and Europe. Several studies have shown that patients infected with these
PCR-ribotype 027 strains have more severe diarrhea, higher
mortality and more recurrences [4-8]. Prior to 2003, only a
handful of these strains were isolated in the UK, whereas currently most typed isolates are PCR-ribotype 027. This is also
mirrored in Canada, where 027 strains were undetected in
2000, but reached 75.2% of all PCR-ribotyped strains by
2003 [9]. The emergence of 027 strains might partially
explain the 72% annual increase in mortality in the UK due to
CDI to 6,500 cases in 2006 [7]. The CDI outbreaks at the
Stoke Mandeville hospital, Buckinghamshire, marked the
arrival of the epidemic 027 isolates to the UK. Between April
2003 and March 2006 a total of 498 patients acquired C. difficile at the hospital (measured by onset of symptoms 72
hours after admission), of which 127 died [10].
PCR-ribotype 027 strains are genetically highly uniform,
which is confirmed by the application of diverse genotyping
methods. For example, 027 strains are invariably designated
as BI by restriction endonuclease analysis, NAP1 (North
American pulsotype 1) by pulse field gel electrophoresis, are
exclusively toxinotype III by toxinotyping and are indistinguishable by multi-locus sequence analysis [11]. The earliest
retrospective recorded PCR-ribotype 027 isolate was strain
CD196 in 1985, which is a non-epidemic strain isolated from
a single patient with CDI in a Paris hospital [12]. The next retrospective recorded 027 isolate was a non-epidemic strain
designated BI-1, which was from a patient with CDI in a Minneapolis hospital in 1988 [13]. Since 1988 a further 19 BI designated strains (all PCR-ribotype 027) have been isolated and
characterized by Gerding and colleagues representing a useful time-line of the evolution of 027 strains (DN Gerding, personal communication).
Comparative phylogenomics (whole genome comparisons of
bacteria using DNA microarrays combined with Bayesian-

based algorithms to model the phylogeny) was recently
applied to 75 C. difficile strains of diverse origin, including 19
strains confirmed as PCR-ribotype 027 (16 BI strains from the
US, CD196, a strain from a recent Canadian outbreak and a
representative strain from the Stoke Mandeville outbreak
designated R20291). All 027 strains formed a tight clade,
which was distinct from the other 56 strains analyzed [14].
Closer inspection of the 027 clade revealed micro-evolution
among strains with the historic non-epidemic CD196 and BI1 strains as progenitors compared to their recently isolated
counterparts [14]. These studies confirm the clonal nature of
PCR-ribotype 027 strains and that they are continuing to
evolve.
C. difficile is known to produce two related glucosylating toxins, named toxin A and toxin B, which are encoded on the
pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) [15]. For some time, toxin production has been the main focus of study when addressing
virulence of C. difficile. However, in the hamster model of
infection toxin B plays the most significant role in infection
[16]. A recent report has shown the binding domain of toxin B
in 027 strains to be highly divergent compared to other C. difficile strains [8]. However, the significance of the difference of
the 027 toxin B gene sequence has yet to be investigated. The
PaLoc also includes toxin regulatory components, including
tcdR, a sigma factor, and tcdC, a negative regulator that
destabilizes the TcdR-holoenzyme to prevent transcription of
the PaLoc [17]. It has been reported that some 027 strains can
produce more toxin in vitro [18], which was initially attributed to deletions in the negative regulator tcdC. Further characterization has revealed that the 18-bp in-frame deletion was
found to have no effect on toxin production [19]. Two additional deletions have been identified within tcdC, a 39 and
single base-pair deletion. The single base-pair deletion
results in the formation of a stop codon downstream and
truncation of the protein, thus leading to increased toxin production. However, various deletions have been identified in
tcdC in non-epidemic PCR-ribotypes as well [20], suggesting
the increased virulence cannot solely be attributed to these
deletions. This has stimulated debate on the mode of hypervirulence in the epidemic 027 strains. Apart from classic virulence determinants such as toxin production, other factors
such as antibiotic resistance, increased motility and adherence in the gut, increased resistance to bile salts and
increased transmissibility manifested through sporulation
might explain the emergence of epidemic 027 strains. A
recent report comparing three 'historical' 027 strains from
Sweden with an epidemic strain concluded that the epidemic
strain sporulated more readily than its three non-epidemic
counterparts [21].
Given the medical and economic importance of CDI and the
difficulties in studying the genetics of C. difficile, we recently
reported the complete genome sequence of a pathogenic C.
difficile strain [22]. The strain chosen, 630 (PCR-ribotype
012), was a multi-drug-resistant isolate from a patient with

PMC at a hospital in Zurich in 1982 [22]. The full sequence
revealed a 4.29 Mb chromosome with a mosaic of potential
mobile genetic elements, antibiotic resistance genes and virulence determinants [22].
The rapid international emergence of the C. difficile 027
strain lineage provides a unique opportunity to understand
the recent emergence of a highly virulent bacterium. In this
study we undertake a three-way genome comparison of an
'historic' non-epidemic 027 C. difficile strain (CD196), a
recent epidemic and hypervirulent 027 strain (R20291) and
the previously published PCR-ribotype 012 strain (630).
Where possible we relate genetic differences to phenotypic
differences observed in these strains with respect to motility,
survival, antibiotic resistance and toxicity.

Results and discussion
Genome comparison of the PCR-ribotype 027 strains
(CD196 and R20291) and strain 630
The two newly sequenced genomes of the PCR-ribotype 027
strains (CD196 historic and R20291 modern; Table 1) were
compared with the previously sequenced strain 630 (PCRribotype 012). The three strains share 3,247 core genes,
including those encoding determinants important for pathogenesis, such as antimicrobial resistance, ethanolamine/proTable 1

panediol metabolism, sporulation, a beta-lactamaseinducing penicillin-binding protein, a quaternary ammonium
compound-resistance protein, tellurium resistance proteins,
a putative nogalamycin resistance protein and L-rhamnose
biosynthesis (Figure 1). There are 505 coding sequences
(CDSs) unique to 630 compared to the 027 strains, whereas
there are 47 CDSs unique to R20291 and three CDSs unique
to CD196 (Figure 1). The locations of regions of genetic difference between the three strains are highlighted in the concentric circular chromosome representations of the three
genomes (Figure 2). There are 234 genes unique to both 027
ribotypes spread among at least 50 regions of genetic difference (Figure 2; Additional data file 1). These include a phage
island, transposon genes, two-component response regulators, drug resistance genes, transporter genes and type I
restriction enzyme/restriction modification genes (Additional data file 1).
There are 14 CDSs that have been disrupted by an insertion in
both 027 strains but are intact in 630; conversely, 12 CDSs are
intact in both 027 strains but have been disrupted in 630
(Additional data file 2). All three genomes have multiple copies of genes for transposase-like proteins that have been
inserted both intragenically and intergenically. In C. difficile
630 there are eight full transposon copies and two remnant
copies; all eight functional copies have inserted within CDSs.
In both 027 strains there are 17 transposon copies, of which
only 6 inserted within CDSs. Only three CDSs are interrupted
by transposons in all three strains. Furthermore, three CDSs
have been truncated by sequence loss in both 027 strains but
are intact in 630 and 10 CDSs are truncated in 630 but not
027 strains (Additional data file 2). Finally, point mutations
have resulted in frameshifts exclusively in three 630 CDSs
and 10 of the 027 strain CDSs (Additional data file 2).

Toxin-related genes specific to 027
Variation within the PaLoc region (containing toxins A and B
and their associates genes) [15] between C. difficile strains
has been observed frequently and has been used to develop
the toxinotyping method to distinguish strains [23-25]. PCRribotype 027 isolates are invariably toxinotype III, whereas
630 (PCR-ribotype 012) is toxinotype 0. A comparison of the
PaLoc sequences from 630, R20291 and CD196 confirms the
previous data, indicating that the tcdB sequence varies
among strains, particularly at the 3' region, which encodes the
toxin-binding domain [26]. However, there is a high level of
sequence conservation in tcdB between the 027 strains
CD196 and R20291 compared to strain 630. Examination of
the relative in vitro cytotoxicity of these three strains on several cell lines confirms differences in both toxicity and cell
line specificity (Table 2). Purified toxin B from R20291 has
more potent activity than that from 630 in all eight cell lines
tested whereas the historic 027 (CD196) is more potent in six
of the eight cell lines tested (Table 2). Given the recent demonstration in the hamster model of CDI that toxin B, and not
toxin A, is essential for virulence, the observation that toxin B

from strain R20291 has a more potent activity over a broader
range of cell types may indicate that this is a contributory factor to the hypervirulence of R20291 [16].
Regulation of toxin expression has also been shown to vary
between strains of C. difficile, which has been attributed to
mutations in the negative regulator tcdC [9]. The most notable of these mutations is the 1-bp deletion present in 027
strains that results in a frame shift and truncation of TcdC,
causing de-repression of the PaLoc [17]. A single base deletion at position 117, resulting in truncation of TcdC at the 66th
amino acid, was confirmed in both R20291 and CD196 but
absent from 630. The presence of the 18-bp deletions in both
R20291 and CD196 but their absence from 630 was confirmed.
The binary ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin, first identified in
1988 in the strain CD196 [12], consists of two genes, cdtA and
cdtB. Surveys have identified the binary toxin in up to 8.6% of
C. difficile strains [27-30]; recently, however, binary toxin
positive PCR-ribotype 027 incidence has reached 41.3% in the
UK [31]. Additionally, the binary toxin has been linked with

increased severity of disease [32-34]. Sequence analysis confirms the presence of full-length cdtA and cdtB genes in both
CD196 and R20291, which by contrast have accumulated
sequence deletions, several frameshift mutations and inframe stop codons in 630. Recently, the CDS upstream has
been identified as the binary toxin response regulator, designated cdtR [35]. C. difficile 630 contains a functional copy of
cdtR despite lacking binary toxin, and CdtR is 96% identical
to the homologues found in both 027 isolates.

Differences in antibiotic resistance between 630 and
PCR-ribotype 027 strains
In contrast to strain 630, the epidemic 027 strains are highly
resistant to fluoroquinolones due to point mutations in the
DNA gyrase genes [36]. Comparison of the gyrA gene identified seven point mutations in DNA gyrase genes between C.
difficile 630 and both 027 strains. Four mutations are silent
and two substitutions - Leu406Ile and Asp468Asn - conserved. Interestingly, the previously described Thr82Ile conversion was only present in the epidemic 027 [36]. Two silent
point mutations (A1458G and C1890T) were identified in the
gyrB gene of the 027 strains. Three fluoroquinolones (gati-

results showed that R20291 was highly resistant to the fluoroquinolones (≤ 32 mg/l for all three fluoroquinolones), but
CD196 was fluoroquinolone sensitive (gatifloxacin minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) 1.5 mg/l, moxifloxacin MIC 2

Sequence data revealed that both 027s have acquired two
unique conjugative transposons absent in C. difficile 630.

but 630 was sensitive to chloramphenicol (MIC 12 mg/l) (P <
0.05).
C. difficile strain 630 has two copies of the erythromycin
resistance gene (ermB1/CD2007 and ermB2/CD2010) on a
mobile transposon Tn5398 (CD2001-2010b), which was
absent in CD196 and R20291. However, experimental data
showed that C. difficile 630 and R20291 were erythromycin
resistant (MIC ≥ 256 mg/l) whereas CD196 had intermediate
resistance (MIC 2 mg/l). Additionally, strain 630 has a tetracycline resistance gene (tetM; CD0508) on CTn3/Tn5397
(CD0496-511), which is absent in CD196 and R20291. C. difficile 630 demonstrated tetracycline resistance (MIC 64 mg/l)
in contrast to CD196 and R20291, which were tetracycline
sensitive (MIC 0.17 mg/l and 0.22 mg/l, respectively) (P <
0.001).
The difference between drug resistance patterns may reflect
changes in antibiotic policy. For example, both CD196 and
630 predate 1992 when Golledge et al. [37] demonstrated
clindamycin not to be a risk factor; subsequently, clindamycin use has been strongly associated with PCR-ribotype 027
outbreaks [38-40]. This demonstrates that antibiotic usage
may be driving the evolution of drug resistance and the predominance of certain isolates.

027-specific genes involved in flagella biosynthesis,
glycosylation and motility
Flagella have been found to be important for motility in several enteric pathogens as a prerequisite to traverse the
mucous layer of the gut to interact with gut epithelial cells
[41-43]. Additionally, chemotaxis mediated through motility
is important in survival, to enable movement towards nutrient-rich sources and movement away from noxious environments. Flagella have been observed in some C. difficile strains
[44,45]. Post-translational modification of flagellin proteins
by glycosylation has been shown to be prevalent in several
bacterial pathogens and the loci encoding these modifications
are frequently located adjacent to the structural flagellin
genes [46]. Such modifications are important in subverting

In 630, flagella-associated genes are found in two loci, F1
(CD0226-CD0240) and F3 (CD0245-CD0271), which are
separated by an inter-flagella locus F2 (CD0241-CD0244).
Loci F2 encodes a phosphoserine phosphatase, two conserved
hypothetical proteins and a putative CDP-Glycerol:Poly (glycerophosphate) glycerophosphotransferase [14] (Figure 3).
Microarray analysis of this region previously showed a loss of,
or high divergence in, F1 and F2 in all 027 isolates tested [14].
The sequence data from both R20291 and CD196 show that
the F1 locus has been retained, but with only 84 to 90%
sequence identity, whereas the four genes present in the
inter-flagella F2 locus of 630 have been replaced by six different genes encoding a glycosyl transferase (family 2), two
putative uncharacterized proteins, a putative carbamoylphosphate-synthetase and a putative ornithine cyclodeaminase (Figure 3).
The variation in the F1 region between 630 and the 027
ribotypes may be important in motility, as there are clear phenotypic differences in the motility of 630 and the 027
ribotypes CD196, R20291 and BI-16 (Figure 4). C. difficile
630 is less motile than the 027 ribotypes, whereas M120 is
non-motile (Figure 4). Microarray data have shown the
absence/divergence of the complete F3 region in M120 [14].
Recent sequence data for M120 have confirmed the deletion
of the entire F3 region in this strain [50], explaining the lack
of motility for strain M120. The subtle differences in motility
between the 630 and the 027 ribotypes may be due to the levels of sequence conservation over the F1 region.
The different genes present in the F2 region of 630 and the
027 ribotypes may be important in the glycosylation of the
flagella, as the six genes present in R20291 and CD196 contain glycosyl transferases. Studies in other enteric bacteria
such as Campylobacter jejuni have shown that both Flagellin,
encoded by FlaA, as well as post-translational modifications
of it are required for autoagglutination, which is linked to virulence [48]. Significant differences in autoagglutination
between 630 and the more recent 027 isolates R20291 and
BI-16 (P < 0.05) were observed, whereas the more historic
027 isolates BI-1 and CD196 show no significant difference in
autoagglutination compared to 630 (Figure 5). The differences in autoagglutination observed between 630 and the
recent 027 isolates are likely to be multifactorial as, in addition to flagella and glycosylation, other surface phenomena
can contribute to autoagglutination.
Four 027 unique genes upstream of the flagella F1 region
(CDR20291_0223-0226 and CD196_0236-0239) that are
absent in 630 may be involved in virulence. The four CDSs
encode DTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase, glucose-1phosphate thymidylyltransferase, DTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase and DTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase.

(630), CDR20291_0248-275 (R20291), and CD196_0261-288 (CD196). Red bars indicate > 84% DNA sequence identity.

These four enzymes (RlmA, B, C and D) are involved in the
synthesis of L-rhamnose. Carbohydrates such as L-rhamnose
can act as structural elements as well as energy sources [51]
and can be important virulence factors in both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria. In Vibrio cholerae, Escheichia
coli and Salmonella enterica, L-rhamnose is an important
residue in the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharides. In Streptococcus mutans, L-rhamnose is part of an antigen involved in
colonization of tooth surfaces [52] and mutations in this pathway have been shown to prevent initiation and maintenance
of infection [53]. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, L-rham-

nose links peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan to form the
unique cell wall. Given their co-location in the F regions, it is
possible that these genes may play a role in flagellin glycosylation in the 027 strains.

027 specific regulatory genes that may be important in
survival
Regulatory genes form a large proportion of the 027-specific
genes, with 8 two-component regulators and 15 other transcriptional regulators. One of the most striking regions of
genetic difference was an additional complete copy of the agr

has been identified as a key regulatory system involved in
multiple aspects of virulence and quorum sensing in Staphylococcus aureus [54]. Downstream of the agr2 locus are three
027-specific CDSs that encode two putative membrane proteins and an ABC transporter ATP-binding protein.

phosphate-buffered saline to an OD600 nm of 1.0 (± 0.1). These were
incubated for 24 hours in pre-equilibrated glass tubes, then the OD600 nm
was measured. The percentage of autoagglutination was normalized to the
starting OD ((Starting OD - Final OD)/Final OD × 100). The bars indicate
the percentage of cells autoagglutinating. Significant differences in
autoagglutination are marked with an asterisk; P < 0.05, Students t-test.
M120 is a non-motile strain thar autoagglutinates to a significantly higher
level than 630 (P < 0.05).

One of the additional transcriptional regulators in the 027
ribotypes is a PadR-like transcriptional regulator
(CDR20291_2964/CD196_2917). The PadR family regulates
phenolic acid metabolism, which may be important in survival of bacteria in the gut, where energy sources are limited.
The CDS is found within a region of six 027-specific genes transcribed on the opposite strand to the other five CDSs that encode a predicted enoate reductase, a nitrate/nitrite
transporter and a conjugative transposon site-specific recombinase. The PadR regulator may also be important in tolerance or production of p-cresol, a phenolyic agent produced by
C. difficile from the degradation of tyrosine. The p-cresol
operon CD0153-155 was conserved within both 027s and in
630. However, there are clear phenotypic differences between
the tolerance to p-cresol between the recent 027 isolates and
630 [55], which may be due to PadR or another transcriptional regulator.

Genetic differences between the historic CD196 strain
and the R20291 hypervirulent strain
Sequence data show that there are at least five genetic regions
unique to the epidemic 027 (R20291) compared to the nonepidemic 027 strain (CD196) (Table 3). We hypothesize that
these newly identified R20291 genetic elements contribute to
the virulent phenotype of this clone. These genetic regions
include a unique approximately 20-kb phage island of high
G+C DNA content termed SMPI1 inserted into a 027 unique
conjugative transposon (named CTn027; Figure 6). This
phage island insertion sequence disrupts the R20291 CDS
CDR20291_1744 and carries a number of cargo genes present
only in R20291, including a two-component response regulator (CDR20291_1748), a putative lantibiotic ABC transporter
(CDR20291_1752), a putative cell surface protein along with
a number of hypothetical and conserved hypothetical proteins. CDR20291_1755 is a unique R20291 gene encoding a
transcriptional regulator (σ24). The phage island also encodes
a toxin-antitoxin system (RelE/StbE family) that is important
in maintaining the stability of mobile elements [56]. RelE
encodes a stable toxin that inhibits translation by cleaving
mRNAs on translating ribosomes [57]. The toxin is inhibited
by an unstable anti-toxin (RelB). This toxin-antitoxin system
has been linked to translation moderation under amino-acid
starvation stress [58].
Both 027 strains share a similar prophage (prophage phi027), which has integrated between the orthologues of 630
CDSs CD1566-7. These prophages (CDR20291_1415-1465,
CD196_1438-89) are identical apart from one small region.
CD196 contains three strain-specific adjacent CDSs, the only
CD196-specific CDS in the whole genome, which encode a

putative phage anti-repressor and two putative uncharacterized proteins. R20291 appears to have lost these three CDSs
and replaced them with a single putative uncharacterized
protein that has 88% identity at the 5' end to one of the lost
uncharacterized proteins and may represent a pseudogene. In
addition, there is a unique R20291 region encoding six genes,
including matE (CDR20291_1779), a member of the Multiantimicrobial extrusion family drug/sodium antiporters. This
region also shows a high G+C content, indicating recent
acquisition.

Acquisition of R20291-specific genes in other PCRribotype 027 strains over time
In order to validate the presence of the R20291-specific genes
and to monitor their acquisition over time, PCR analysis was
undertaken on 19 PCR-ribotype 027 strains that have been
isolated over a 16-year period across the US (Table 1). These
isolates were typed by restriction endonuclease analysis as BI,
which is equivalent to PCR-ribotype 027; however, each isolate represents a unique small variation found in the BI
restriction endonuclease analysis patterns. Strains BI-1 to -5
are considered 'historic' and were isolated between 1988 and
1995. BI-6 to -17 are considered 'modern' and were isolated
from 2001 to 2004. Strains 630 and CD196 (ribotypes 012
and 027, respectively) were used as negative controls (Table
4).
Eleven R20291-specific genes were chosen for PCR analysis
(Table 4). Four genes (CDR20291_1744, CDR20291_1751 to
_1753) are found on the R20291-specific phage island; gene
CDR20291_1744 is a site specific recombinase,
CDR20291_1751 and CDR20291_1752 are putative lantibiotic ABC transporters and CDR20291_1753 is unknown. In
addition, the R20291-specific transcriptional regulator
(YobD protein) is also present in the 'modern' BI strains (6p,
8, 12, 16 and 17) but absent from the earlier BI strains. Only
one R20291-specific gene (CDR20291_1419; BRO protein
family) was amplified in the early BI strains (BI-1, -2 and -5),
showing the acquisition of R20291 genes was more prevalent
in the epidemic 027 BI strains (Table 4). Furthermore, recent
data demonstrate that the epidemic 027 strain, named BI-6,
is more virulent in the hamster infection model than early
strains such as BI-1 [13].

Conclusions

C. difficile is the most frequent cause of nosocomial diarrhea
worldwide, in part due to the rapid and dramatic worldwide
emergence of the PCR-ribotype 027 strains. We show that
027 strains have considerable genetic differences compared
to strain 630 that may relate to observed phenotypic differences in motility, survival, antibiotic resistance and toxicity.
Additionally, five genetic regions appear to have accumulated
in the modern day epidemic 027 strain R20291 compared to
the historic CD196 counterpart. This includes a unique
approximately 20-kb phage island of high G+C content DNA

(SMPI1) inserted into a 027 unique conjugative transposon.
However, the role of individual determinants through mutagenesis and the testing of mutants in appropriate in vivo
models is required to provide conclusive evidence. Some of
these elements appear to have accumulated in 027 strains
over the past 16 years and may therefore be useful genetic
markers for epidemic 027 strains. The observed gene differences between these strains might individually or collectively
explain why modern 027 strains are more likely to be epidemic and could explain the higher case-fatality ratio and
persistence associated with infection by these strains. These
studies facilitate pinpointing the genetic and phenotypic
attributes that may explain the emergence of the hypervirulent 027 strain and contribute in general to our understanding of the evolution of bacterial virulence.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
C. difficile 027 isolates designated BI-1 to -17 were provided
by Dale Gerding (Hines VA Hospital, Hines, IL, USA). C. difficile 630 [59] was isolated from a patient with PMC in
Zurich, 1982 and has been fully sequenced by the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute [22]. Strain 630 was provided by Peter
Mullany, Eastman Dental Institute, London, UK. The 027
strain CD196 is a non-epidemic strain isolated from a patient
with PMC in Paris, 1985 and was provided by Michel Popoff,
Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. The hypervirulent 027
R20291 was isolated from a recent outbreak in Stoke Mandeville, UK and was provided by Jon Brazier, Anaerobe Reference Laboratory, Cardiff, UK.
C. difficile was routinely cultured on Braziers agar (Bioconnections, Leeds, South Yorkshire, UK) containing 4% egg
yolk, C. difficile supplement (Bioconnections) and 2% defibrinated horse blood or in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth containing C. difficile supplement (Oxoid, Basingstoke,
Hampshire, UK) and 0.04% cysteine. All cultures were grown
in an anaerobic atmosphere (10% CO2, 10% H2, 80% N2) at
37°C.

DNA isolation and PCR amplification
Genomic C. difficile DNA was isolated by cell lysis, phenol
chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Briefly,
overnight cultures were resuspended in 3 ml EDTA and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 20 mg/ml lysozyme (SigmaAldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK), 10 KU/ml mutanolysin
(Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mg/ml lysostaphin (Sigma-Aldrich) and
100 mg/ml RNase (Invitrogen, Paisley, Renfrewshire, UK).
Proteinase K (25 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and 20% SDS
(Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the cell suspension and incubated at 50°C for 1 hour. DNA was extracted by phenol:chloroform:IAA (Sigma-Aldrich) washes and chloroform:IAA
(Sigma-Aldrich) washes. Genomic DNA was precipitated
using 100% ethanol and purified with two washes of 80% ethanol. Purity was assessed and quantification done using a

NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer and by running the samples on 1.0% agarose gel, 100 mV for 45 minutes.
PCR amplifications were performed using primers described
in Additional data file 3. Reactions were performed using 35
cycles at 94°C for 15 seconds, 50°C for 1 minute, 72°C for 1
minute, followed by a final extension of 72°C for 7 minutes.
PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels run at 100
mV for 1 hour and stained with ethidium bromide.

DNA sequencing and assembly
Genomic sequences were generated by combining data from
454/Roche technology (using GS20 for R20291 and FLX for
CD196) with shotgun capillary reads from ABI 3730xl analyzers (Table 5). Reads from the 454 platform were assembled de
novo (without guidance from a reference sequence) into contigs using newbler (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, Hertford-

shire, UK), then shredded into artificial reads of comparable
lengths to capillary reads. An assembly was created with data
from both platforms using Phrap. For each combined assembly the order of contigs was estimated by comparing them to
strain 630 genomic sequence using ABACAS [60]. To further
correct homopolymer tract errors inherent in early 454
sequencing data, Solexa (Illumina, Saffron Walden, Essex)
sequence data were generated for isolate R20291. The Illumina sequences were assembled de novo using Velvet [61]
and the resulting contigs were incorporated with the combined 454 and capillary assembly. Closing gaps between contigs for both CD196 and R20291 was either by primer walking
on subclones from the capillary shotgun or by sequencing
PCR products covering gaps between adjacent contigs. The
final contiguous sequence for CD196 was mostly from combined data but small regions were covered with only 454 data
(a total of less than 2.6% of the sequence) or with only capil-

Genome annotation, comparison and orthologue
identification
Genome annotation of C. difficile strains CD196 and R20291
was based on previously published annotations of C. difficile
strain 630 [22]. The genomic sequences of strains CD196 and
R20291 were compared against the database of strain 630
proteins by blastx, and a CDS feature in the query genome
was created when a hit of over 90% identity was found.
Glimmer3 [62] was used to predict CDSs in genomic regions
where no significant hits were found. Any unique genomic
regions left were examined and annotated manually in
Artemis [63]. The genome comparisons were visualized in
Artemis and ACT (Artemis Comparison Tool) [64]. The
sequences of CD196 and R20291 can be accessed using the
accession numbers [EMBL: FN538970] and [EMBL:
FN545816], respectively.

The reciprocal-best-hit fasta search algorithm was used to
identify orthologues among strains 630, CD196 and R20291.
All CDSs in the query genome were searched in the database
of subject CDSs by FASTA [65]. When a hit of over 30% identity and over 80% length was found, the hit CDS in the subject
genome was searched again in the database of query CDSs in
a similar fashion. If the hit of the second search is the same as
the original query CDS, the two CDSs are considered as orthologues by this method. These identified orthologues were
manually curated to account for inaccuracies caused by
inserted elements, frameshifts and pseudogenes.

Toxin B toxicity assay
Toxins were produced by the dialyzing cultivation method
[66] with BHI broth (Oxoid) as outer medium and 10% NaCl
as inner medium. Cultures were performed at 37°C for 4 days.
Toxin B was purified as previously described [67] using ion
exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephacel, GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire UK) and gel
filtration (Superdex G200, GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Toxin B preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the
band corresponding to toxin B for each strain was quantified
by gel densitometry (Additional data file 4).
Cytotoxicity assays were performed as previously described
[68]. Subconfluent cell monolayers were obtained in 96 well
plates and were inoculated with serial dilutions of toxin B

rounding up in 50% of the cells and is expressed as toxin
molarity (corresponding to toxin specific activity).

Motility assay
Cultures were grown anaerobically for 1 to 2 days on Braziers
media from glycerol stocks. BHI agar (0.05%) was poured
into 30 ml glass vials that were then pre-equilibrated for 4
hours in the anaerobe chamber. Three single colonies were
picked with a loop and inoculated into the top 2 to 5 mm of
BHI agar in the glass vial. These were then left overnight in
the anaerobe chamber; the vials were then removed from the
anaerobe chamber and photographed to record the motility.

Minimum inhibitory concentration determination
using Etest
Chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, mocifloxacin and lexofloxacin) MICs
were determined using Etest strips (Biomérieux, Marcy
l'Etoile, France). C. difficile was cultured overnight on Brazier's CCEY agar (Bioconnections) with 1% defibrinated horse
blood (Oxoid) and C. difficile supplement (Bioconnections).
All cultures were undertaken at 37°C in an anaerobe chamber
(10% CO2, 10% H2, 80% N2). A bacterial suspension in BHI
(no. 3 McFarland standard) was inoculated onto the surface
of Brazier's agar and was then dried for 15 to 30 minutes.
Etest strips were placed onto agar surface. Agar plates were
incubated anaerobically (37°C) for 24 hours and 48 hours,
and MICs were determined following the manufacturer's
instructions.

We thank Jon Brazier for provision of strain R20291 and Frances Smith for
assistance with library making. We acknowledge the Wellcome Trust for
