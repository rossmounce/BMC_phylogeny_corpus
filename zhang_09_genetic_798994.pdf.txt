Abstract
Background: Ophiocordyceps sinensis (syn. Cordyceps sinensis), endemic to alpine regions on the
Tibetan plateau, is one of the most valuable medicinal fungi in the world. Huge commercial demand
has led to excessive harvest and a dramatic decline in its numbers. The diversity of terrains and
climates on the Tibetan Plateau and the broad insect host range (more than 50 species in the family
Hepialidae) may have resulted in substantial intraspecific genetic diversity for this fungus. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the population distribution of O. sinensis from geographically
diverse regions of the Tibetan Plateau based on nrDNA ITS and MAT1-2-1 gene sequences.
Understanding of the genetic diversity and genesis of O. sinensis will provide important information
for the evolution and conservation of this fungus.
Results: Significant sequence variations in the ITS and MAT1-2-1 genes (27 and 23 informative sites,
eight and seven haplotypes, respectively) were observed. Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS
sequences, MAT1-2-1 sequences, or their combined data set, clustered isolates from northern
regions in one clade (clade I), whereas isolates from southern regions were dispersed in all four
clades (clade I-IV). Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses of 2639 ITS clones
from seven samples revealed 91 different SSCP patterns that were subsequently sequenced. ITS
heterogeneity was found in XZ-LZ07-H1 (Nyingchi population), and 17 informative sites and five
haplotypes were detected from 15 clones. The five haplotypes clustered into three clades (clade I,
II, and IV).
Conclusions: Significant genetic divergence in O. sinensis was observed and the genetic
diversification was greater among southern isolates than that among northern isolates. The
polymorphism of nrDNA ITS sequences suggested that O. sinensis spread from a center of origin
(the Nyingchi District) to southern regions and subsequently to northern areas. These results

suggest that southern populations are important reservoirs of genetic diversity and should be taken
into account in conservation programs.

Background
The ascomycete Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Berk.) Sung, Sung,
Hywel-Jones and Spatafora (syn. Cordyceps sinensis) [1],
commonly known as the Chinese caterpillar fungus, has
been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for the
treatment of asthma, bronchial, lung inflammation, and
other diseases [2]. The medicinal activity is from the complex of the moth caterpillar parasitized by the fungus and
the fungal stroma biomass. The caterpillars, which belong
to the family Hepialidae, live underground in soil burrows in the Tibetan plateau and feed on plant roots. When
an infection is established, the fungus grows within body
cavity of the insect larvae and eventually kills and mummifies them in the underground burrows. Fungal fruiting
body emerges from the front end of the caterpillar and
pokes out of the ground in spring and early summer [3].
The natural distribution of this fungus, however, is limited to alpine regions on the Tibetan Plateau and huge
commercial demand has led to excessive harvest and a
dramatic decline in its numbers [4]. As a result, the price
for natural O. sinensis has increased rapidly and it cost as
much as $32,000 (USD) per kg for top quality in late 2006
[5]. Although several fermented mycelial products from
the anamorph (Hirsutella sinensis) of the fungus have been
commercialized in China [6], the teleomorph, which is
the component for traditional Chinese medicine, has not
yet been commercially cultivated. The natural population
of this fungus needs to be preserved for the fragile Tibetan
Plateau ecosystem and for sustainable supply of this natural resource.
Ophiocordyceps sinensis occupies a diverse habitat on the
Tibetan Plateau, which is the largest and highest plateau
on Earth, covering more than 2.5 million km2 at an average elevation of over 4.5 km [7]. It is surrounded by and
interspersed with towering mountain ranges. Its complex
geomorphology and climate generate substantial interregional variation which results in remarkable faunal and
floral diversity and high levels of endemism [8-11]. O. sinensis is endemic to the Tibetan Plateau and occurs at elevations ranging from 3000 m up to the snow line [4]. This
distribution pattern suggests that the evolution of O. sinensis was significantly influenced by the tectonic movements during the strong uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. The
spread of O. sinensis, depending on the shooting of
ascospores, is limited to defined areas in a mountain and
is unlikely through discontinuous mountains. Therefore,
gene flow between different populations on discontinu-

ous mountains is expected to be low, and divergence may
have occurred [12].
Intraspecific genetic diversity of O. sinensis may also be
generated by its wide host range. O. sinensis infects soilborne larvae of more than 50 species of ghost moths,
mostly in the genus Hepialus and to a lesser extent in the
genera Hepialiscus, Forkalus, and Bipectilus [13,14]. Coevolution between the fungus and its host insects may have
originated a long time ago [15]. Although the host insects
in general have a limited distribution in the Tibetan Plateau and their distribution varies among different mountain ranges and even from different sides and habitats of
the same mountain [16], the greater mobility of moths
may also drive the genetic diversity of the fungus.
To date, genetic diversity of O. sinensis has only been studied at the local level of limited geographic areas. Three
populations found in the north (Menyuan, Maqu, and
Luqu), the middle (Yushu and Chengduo), and the south
(Baima Snow Mountain, Renzhi Snow Mountain,
Dacaodi, and Chongcaoxiawa) of the Tibetan Plateau,
have been recognized from 29 samples based on RAPD
analyses [12]. Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analyses of O. sinensis from 11 counties in Qinghai Province
also resulted in three groups (around the Qinghai Lake,
central eastern Qinghai, and southern Qinghai) [17].
Based on ITS sequences of samples from 11 localities in
southwestern China, O. sinensis was divided into two populations (one from southwestern Sichuan to the northern
slopes of the Himalayan Mountains, the other from
northern Sichuan to Qinghai and Gansu) [18]. However,
ITS sequence analyses in another study did not indicate
any subgroup for 17 O. sinensis samples from different
geographical regions [19]. Overall, the number of O. sinensis samples used in earlier studies was limited, and more
samples from Tibet, a major production area, should be
surveyed. In addition, other molecular markers, especially
protein-encoding genes, should be employed to clarify the
genetic diversity and to refine the phylogenetic origin of
this fungus.
Mating-type genes play an important role in the evolution
of fungal species. Sexual development is controlled by a
single mating-type locus (MAT) in the fungi of Ascomycota. The term "idiomorph" instead of "allele" is usually
used to describe the two alternate forms (MAT1-1 and
MAT1-2) at the mating-type locus [20]. Mating-type genes
evolve at a faster rate than other sequences, such as ITS

and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [21].
Although MAT1-2-1 sequences have been used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among closely related
species and usually provide high resolution [22], other
studies found that the variability of MAT1-2-1 within species is low [21]. A putative mating-type gene (MAT1-2-1)
of O. sinensis was cloned in our laboratory. Similar to
MAT1-2-1 orthologs of other ascomycetes, the O. sinensis
MAT1-2-1 gene contained the conserved HMG motif. The
sequence homologies to Cordyceps militaris and Cordyceps
takaomontana were ~50% between cDNA sequences and
~40% between amino acid sequences (Zhang et al.,
unpublished data). During our preliminary experiment,
several distinctive base changes within the MAT1-2-1
sequences were found among some O. sinensis isolates.
Therefore, this gene was selected to investigate whether it
can provide reasonable information on the genetic diversity of O. sinensis.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the population
distribution of O. sinensis from geographically diverse
regions of the Tibetan Plateau based on nrDNA ITS and
MAT1-2-1 gene sequences. Understanding of the genetic
diversity and genesis of O. sinensis should provide valuable information for the protection and sustainable utilization of this natural resource.

Results
Sequence variations of nrDNA ITS and MAT1-2-1 genes
among O. sinensis isolates
Fifty-six O. sinensis isolates from different geographical
regions were used in this study (Additional file 1). Their
nrDNA ITS and MAT1-2-1 sequences were analyzed. For
the 531-535 bp ITS sequences, the detectable nucleotide
variations occurred at 35 sites, including 27 parsimony
informative sites and eight singleton variable sites.
Among the 27 parsimony informative sites, 13 were T/C
base transitions; eight were A/G transitions; five were
transversions of T/G, T/A, or A/C; and one was T/A/C substitution (see Additional file 2). Most of these informative
sites were located in the ITS1 (11 sites) and ITS2 regions
(14 sites), plus one each in the 5.8S and 28S regions (at
sites 319 and 514, respectively). The singleton sites were
not included in the subsequent haplotype analysis
because one polymorphism at such a site was represented
by only one isolate and such variation might be introduced artificially during PCR or sequencing steps. In addition, a 4-bp deletion was detected within the ITS2 region
of two isolates (XZ-LZ07-H1 and XZ-LZ07-H2).

Detectable nucleotide variations within the 877-882 bp
MAT1-2-1 sequences occurred at 28 sites, including 23
parsimony informative sites and five singleton variable
sites. There were 10 T/C transitions, seven A/G transitions,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/290

and six C/G transversions (see Additional file 3). Nucleotide variations in nine sites resulted in amino acid
changes. Interestingly, the two isolates that had base deletions within the ITS region contained a 5-bp insertion
within the first intron of the MAT1-2-1 gene.
Haplotypes within the 56 O. sinensis isolates
Haplotype usually refers to a group of alleles at multiple
loci that are transmitted together on a single chromosome
or to a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
[23]. Ascosporic fungi are haploid and haplotypes were
identified in this study according to base change patterns
at informative sites among individual isolates. For the 56
isolates used in this study, eight ITS haplotypes, seven
MAT1-2-1 haplotypes, and 14 combined haplotypes were
detected (Figure 1, Additional file 1). The results showed
that one haplotype might include isolates from different
geographical regions (e.g., ITS type 7 and MAT1-2-1 type
G), and isolates from the same location (e.g., XZ-NQ-176
and XZ-NQ-180) might contain different haplotypes.

For the eight ITS haplotypes (1-8), type 1 was the most
dominant and it was represented by 28 isolates mainly
from northern regions (Nagqu, Chamdo, Yushu, and
Laji). Type 2 included nine isolates mainly from southern
regions (Nyingchi and Baima). Other haplotypes were
represented by two to five isolates (Figure 1, Additional
file 1).
For the seven MAT1-2-1 haplotypes (A-G), type A was the
most dominant and widespread; and it was represented
by 33 isolates mainly from northern regions (Nagqu,
Chamdo, Yushu, Laji, and Qilian). The next most common haplotype was type B, which included seven isolates
from southern regions, such as Nyingchi, Baima, and
Garze. Type C was represented by seven isolates from
southern Tibet (Nyingchi and Mila). Other haplotypes
were represented by one to three isolates (Figure 1, Additional file 1).
For the 14 combined haplotypes (Figure 1), type 1A was
the most dominant and it included 28 isolates. The next
most common combined haplotype was type 2C, which
was represented by six isolates from Nyingchi. Other haplotypes were represented by one to three isolates.
Phylogenetic analyses
Minimum evolutionary phylogenetic analyses were performed with sequences of the nrDNA ITS region, the
MAT1-2-1 gene, and their combined data set. In these
phylogenetic trees, two major clades (I and II) and two
small clades (III and IV) were distinguished (Figure 1, see
also Additional file 4).

Clade I (north clade) was composed of isolates mainly
from northern Tibet (Nagqu and Chamdo) and Qinghai
(Yushu, Laji, and Qilian) with the exception of several isolates from southern regions (XZ-ML-3, XZ-LZ07-64, and/
or SC-3). This clade received bootstrap support values of
86%, 73%, and 95% in three phylogenetic trees, and
included three ITS haplotypes, two MAT1-2-1 haplotypes,
and four combined haplotypes (Figure 1, Additional file
4).
Clade II was composed of southern isolates from southern
Tibet (Nyingchi and Mila), Yunnan, and Sichuan. It had
bootstrap support of 91%, 60%, and 64% in the three
phylogenetic trees, and included three ITS haplotypes,
three MAT1-2-1 haplotypes, and eight combined haplotypes (Figure 1, Additional file 4).
Two southern isolates, XZ-SN-44 and XZ-LZ05-6, clustered together as the third clade (clade III), having 97%,
99%, and 99% bootstrap support in the three trees (Figure
1, Additional file 4). The southern isolates XZ-LZ07-H1
and XZ-LZ07-H2 formed the fourth clade (clade IV) and
had a distant relationship with other isolates (Figure 1,
Additional file 4). Among all tested isolates, the maximal
ITS distance value was 0.043 between XZ-LZ07-H1 and
QH-QL-206 or QH-QL-207. The maximal MAT1-2-1 distance value was 0.023 between YN-4 and XZ-LZ07-H1 or
XZ-LZ07-H2.
The phylogenetic trees constructed with ITS sequences
and with MAT1-2-1 sequences had very similar topological structures (see Additional file 4). Four clades were dis-

criminated in both trees, and composition of isolates for
each clade was almost identical between the two trees.
However, there were some discrepancies between the two
trees. For example, isolate SC-3 clustered in clade II in the
ITS tree, but in clade I in the MAT1-2-1 tree. Clade II was
the sister group of clade III in the ITS tree, but the sister
group of clade I in the MAT1-2-1 tree. The parameters of
nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity were usually
higher in the ITS sequences than in the MAT1-2-1
sequences (Table 1). Therefore, the ITS sequence is relatively more polymorphic than the MAT1-2-1 sequence.
Population structure and gene flow
For both ITS and MAT1-2-1, significant genetic differentiation was detected among isolates in Nyingchi versus
Yushu, Nagqu, Chamdo, and Garze; Garze versus Nagqu,
Chamdo, and Nyingchi; and Baima versus Yushu, Nagqu,
and Chamdo (Table 2). In addition, there was also significant differentiation for ITS sequences among isolates in
Nagqu versus Qilian; Nyingchi versus Qilian; and Garze
versus Yushu (Table 2). Analyses of molecular variance
(AMOVA) based on haplotype frequencies showed significant FCT values in the following population grouping patterns: [south isolates] [north isolates]; [Nyingchi] [other
south isolates] [north isolates]; [Garze] [other south isolates] [north isolates]; and [Garze] [other south isolates]
[Qilian and Laji] [other north isolates] (Table 3). Significant difference (P < 0.01) was observed for these grouping
patterns. These results indicate that an organized population structure exists among O. sinensis isolates.

ITS heterogeneity by PCR-SSCP analyses
In total, 2639 ITS clones (1483 clones from four northern
samples and 1156 clones from three southern samples)
were analyzed by SSCP. Ninety-one clones with different
SSCP patterns (60 for the northern samples and 31 for the
southern samples) were sequenced (Table 4). Compared
with the corresponding original sequence from direct
sequencing, no ITS heterogeneity was detected for clones
from each of these specimens except for XZ-NQ-166 and
XZ-LZ07-H1, which had three (23 clones) and 17 informative sites (15 clones), respectively (Table 4). High nucleotide diversity (1.66 ± 0.34) and haplotype diversity (0.88

± 0.07) were observed among clones of XZ-LZ07-H1. The
4-bp sequence deletion in XZ-LZ07-H1 from direct
sequencing existed within some clones of XZ-LZ07-H1
(see Additional file 5). Among these 17 informative sites
from 15 clones of XZ-LZ07-H1, 15 changes occurred at
known informative sites and one at known singleton sites
(see footnotes of Additional file 5). Every possible nucleotide change at these informative sites was shared by at
least two to five clones. According to base changes at these
informative sites, clones of XZ-LZ07-H1 can be divided
into five haplotypes (I-V). The five haplotypes contained
eight, three, two, one, and one clone(s), respectively (Fig-

ure 2). Clones from the four northern isolates were clustered together in agreement with their original sequences
from direct sequencing (Figure 2). Similarly, clones from
two of the three southern samples (XZ-LZ07-30 and YN6) were clustered together correspondingly with their original sequences from direct sequencing (Figure 2). However, the 15 clones from isolate XZ-LZ07-H1 were
scattered among three clades (clade I, II, and IV). It is
noteworthy that HT-94P clustered with the northern isolates (clade I).

Discussion
The distance value (K value) of nrDNA ITS sequences
from one fungal species typically ranges from 0 to 0.05
[24,25]. The maximal distance value among O. sinensis
populations in this study was 0.043. Although five putative new species related to O. sinensis were reported based
on morphological characters and geographical distribution [26-28], they should not be treated as different species based on nrDNA ITS sequences [29]. A high degree of
intraspecific genetic diversity of O. sinensis has been
detected, but it was still highly dissimilar even from the
most closely related lineages within same genus, having
about 10% of ITS difference with O. robertsii (see Additional file 6).
In general, mating-type genes are more variable between
species than within species [21] and the high degree of
variations between species has been used to study the phylogeny of some closely related fungal groups [22]. In contrast to the low within-species variation (0.15-0.31%
nucleotide sites different) of Cochliobolus heterostrophus
[21] and Phaeosphaeria nodorum [30], our comparison of
56 O. sinensis isolates detected at least 23 base changes
within 877-882 nucleotides of the MAT1-2-1 sequences
(2.6%), including nine nonsynonymous variations. This
suggests that the unique geophysical environment and

wide insect host range have resulted in a high degree of
intraspecific genetic diversity within O. sinensis. Matingtype genes are master regulators of the signal transduction
pathway of mating [21], but whether variations within
MAT1-2-1 sequence affect the sexual reproduction of O.
sinensis is unknown. The fact that all strains contain the
MAT1-2-1 gene suggests that it might be homothallic,
capable of self-fruiting. However, more study is needed to
clarify the mating system of O. sinensis. This study is the
first attempt to use a mating-type gene to determine
whether the gene sequence differs among O. sinensis isolates from different localities. This is also the first proteinencoding gene used for the genetic analyses of O. sinensis
isolates from different regions.
In this study, significant genetic divergence within the species of O. sinensis was revealed by two genes (nrDNA ITS
and MAT1-2-1) and two main populations were detected:
the southern population (Nyingchi, Mila, Shannan,
Garze, and Baima) and the northern populations (Yushu,
Qilian, Laji, Chamdo, and Nagqu). Diversification among
southern isolates was greater than that among northern
isolates. In addition, significant genetic differentiation
was observed between Nyingchi and other populations.
Nyingchi has greater within-population genetic diversity
than other populations. ITS heterogeneity was detected in
isolate XZ-LZ07-H1 from Nyingchi. These results imply
that Nyingchi might have acted as a center of origin of O.
sinensis and O. sinensis might have been transmitted from
Nyingchi to other locations (Figure 3). O. sinensis might
have spread eastward and westward first among southern
regions on the Tibetan Plateau. This spread in southern
Tibetan Plateau may be initiated along two large and parallel mountain ranges, the Himalaya Mountains (south of
Nyingchi) and the Nyainqentanglha Mountains (north of
Nyingchi), which run in east and west directions. The
spread from south to north on the Tibetan Plateau might

Proposed

have occurred at a later time and this may be achieved by
air currents from the Indian Ocean through Yarlung
Zangbo Grand Canyon.
Both O. sinensis and its host insects are endemic species on
the Tibetan Plateau; and the geography and climate may
have played an important role in their evolution and
coevolution. However, the broad range of host insects and
their distribution characters may also have impacted on
the diversification of O. sinensis because the fungus must
parasitize caterpillar to complete its life cycle [13,14,16].
Host species of the fungal isolates used in this study and
the genetic diversity of the hosts were not determined. The
whole picture of O. sinensis genetic differentiation and the
coevolution between O. sinensis and host insects needs to
be further studied [15].

Two southern isolates, XZ-LZ07-H1 and XZ-LZ07-H2, had
relatively distant genetic relationships from other isolates.
Compared to the ITS or MAT1-2-1 sequences of other isolates, the sequences of these two isolates had two fixed 4or 5-bp indels and 13 unique base changes. According to
the newly proposed "indel-associated substitution" theory, the high substitution frequency in these two isolates
may be related to the existence of the two indels. The theory asserts that the single-nucleotide mutation rate
increases in regions surrounding the insertion or deletion
sites [31]. Furthermore, ITS heterogeneity was detected in
XZ-LZ07-H1, but the potential sources of heterogeneity
are still unknown. The fact that one clone of XZ-LZ07-H1
clustered in the northern clade suggests that hybridization
is one of the possible mechanisms. Inherent mechanisms
involving slippage events during DNA duplication may

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:290

also be one of the reasons for the existence of base indels
in the sequence of XZ-LZ07-H1 and XZ-LZ07-H2.
The considerable base changes detected in this study indicated that recombination might have occurred between
different O. sinensis populations. Considering the difficulty of gene flow among different populations, O. sinensis may have an ancestral origin. According to a recent
report, although diversification of insect pathogens
within the fungal order of Hypocreales occurred during
the Cretaceous period, the genesis of O. sinensis was an
event during the Cenozoic era (65.5 million years ago
(Mya) to present) [32]. We suggest the history of O. sinensis was not earlier than 1.8 Mya, because the altitude of the
Tibetan Plateau reached ~2000 m in the Eupleistocene
(1.8 to 0.8 Mya) and it has kept a trend of rapid uplifting
since then [33].

Conclusions
Based on two DNA sequences (nrDNA ITS and MAT1-21), significant genetic divergence was detected among 56
isolates of O. sinensis collected from different regions of
the Tibetan Plateau. The genetic diversification was greater
among southern isolates than that among northern isolates, indicating that southern populations were important genetic reservoirs of this species to be considered in
conservation programs. The polymorphism of nrDNA ITS
sequences suggests that the Nyingchi District is the center
of origin of O. sinensis; and that the fungus may have first
spread from this center first to other southern regions and
then to northern areas.

Methods
Ophiocordyceps sinensis
Fifty-six natural specimens representing 11 populations of
O. sinensis were collected from the Tibet Autonomous
Region, Qinghai Province, Sichuan Province, and Yunnan
Province in southwestern China during 2005 and 2008
(Additional file 1). After dug out from the soil, each specimen was placed into a new zip plastic bag immediately.
They were taken back to our laboratory by keeping at low
temperature in a portable refrigerator and stored at 4°C
after arrival. Anamorphic strains were isolated from stromatal tissues within three weeks according to the protocol
of Liu et al [34]. The remaining fruiting bodies were stored
at -20°C. Either axenic isolates or the stromatal section of
natural specimens were used for DNA analysis.
Amplification of sequences from the nrDNA ITS region
Genomic DNA was extracted with the CTAB method [35].
ITS regions of nrDNA were amplified with the primers
ITS5 (5'-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3') and ITS4
(5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') using high-fidelity
Pfu DNA polymerase (TIANGEN BIOTECH, China). The
PCR mixture contained 5 μl of 10 × Pfu buffer, 5 μl of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/290

dNTP mixture (2.5 mM), 2 μl of each primer (10 μM), 2
μl of deionized formamide, 1 μl of MgCl2 (25 mM), 1 μl
of genomic DNA, and 0.5 μl of Pfu DNA polymerase in a
total volume of 50 μl. PCR amplification was performed
in a TGRADIENT thermocycler (Biometra, Germany). The
mixture was heated for 5 min at 94°C; then subjected to
35 cycles of 40 s at 94°C, 40 s at 54°C, and 60 s at 72°C;
and a final 10 min elongation step at 72°C. After confirmation of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis, the fragments were cleaned using the 3S Spin PCR
Product Purification Kit (Biocolor Bioscience & Technology Company, China). The purified PCR products were
then sequenced with the primer ITS5 using an ABI 3730
XL DNA sequencer with BigDye 3.1 Terminators (Applied
Biosystems, USA).
Amplification of sequences for MAT1-2-1 gene
The MAT1-2-1 gene of O. sinensis was first cloned in our
laboratory using degenerate primers, and both flanks were
extended using DNA Walking SpeedUp™ Premix Kit
(Seegene, Korea) (Zhang et al., unpublished data). For this
study, MAT1-2-1 sequences were amplified with the primers MAT1-2F1 (5'-CCACCGATCCAAGTCTCCT-3') and
MAT1-2R2 (5'-CAGTTTCAGTCGCTGTCGTG-3'). The
assay included: 5 μl of 10× Pfu buffer, 5 μl of dNTP mixture (2.5 mM), 2 μl of each primer (10 μM), 1 μl of
genomic DNA, 0.5 μl of Pfu DNA polymerase, and water
to a final volume of 50 μl. The PCR profile consisted of:
94°C for 5 min; followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 40 s,
55°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 70 s; with a final 10 min incubation at 72°C. PCR products were purified, and sequencing was done in both directions using both the forward
and reverse primers following the protocol described
above.
SSCP analysis
SSCP is the electrophoretic separation of single-stranded
nucleic acids based on subtle differences in sequence
(often a single base pair). We used this technology to
identify ITS heterogeneity of O. sinensis. Based on the
results from analyses of ITS sequences, four samples from
northern regions (QH-YS-197B, QH-YS-189, XZ-NQ-154,
and XZ-NQ-166) and three samples from southern
regions (XZ-LZ07-30, XZ-LZ07-H1, and YN-6) were
selected for SSCP analyses. Each sample was divided into
two or three sections (stromata, sclerotia, and/or external
mycelial vela), and genomic DNA was extracted separately
from each section. ITS sequences were amplified with the
primers ITS1 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and
ITS4 using the same conditions described for amplification of nrDNA ITS sequences. The exception was that Taq
DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) instead of Pfu was used
for the convenience of subsequent cloning. The PCR products were ligated into the TA plasmid pMD18-T (TaKaRa,
Japan) and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Col-

ony PCR was then conducted to amplify the ITS1 region
with the primers ITS1 and ITS2 (5'-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3'). Clones with expected amplicons were used
for SSCP analyses following the procedure of Wang et al
[36]. Different migration profiles between clones were
compared using the Image J software. Representative
clones of distinct patterns were sequenced with the universal primer M13-47.

Sequence analyses
Sequences were aligned with Clustal X [37], and ambiguous regions in both sides were excluded from the subsequent analyses. For the ITS region, 531-535 bp of
sequences including partial 18S (5 bp), ITS1 (160 bp),
5.8S (157 bp), ITS2 (171-175 bp), and partial 28S (38 bp)
were used. For the MAT1-2-1 gene, 877-882 bp of
sequences from 14 bases upstream of the start codon to six
bases downstream of the stop codon were used. Pairwise
distance matrices and minimum evolutionary (ME) phylogenetic analyses were conducted with the Kimura 2Parameter model using MEGA 4 software [38]. To assess
the confidence of phylogenetic relationships, the bootstrap tests were conducted with 1000 resamplings. Ophiocordyceps robertsii was used as the outgroup. DnaSP
software (version 4.50.3) was used to estimate the genetic
parameters of nucleotide diversity [39]. Genetic differentiation between populations and the analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) were assessed using the program
Arlequin 3.11 [40].
