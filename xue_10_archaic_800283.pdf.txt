Abstract
Background: Many proteins or their regions known as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs) lack unique 3D structure in their native states under physiological conditions yet fulfill key
biological functions. Earlier bioinformatics studies showed that IDPs and IDRs are highly abundant in different
proteomes and carry out mostly regulatory functions related to molecular recognition and signal transduction.
Archaea belong to an intriguing domain of life whose members, being microbes, are characterized by a unique
mosaic-like combination of bacterial and eukaryotic properties and include inhabitants of some of the most
extreme environments on the planet. With the expansion of the archaea genome data (more than fifty archaea
species from five different phyla are known now), and with recent improvements in the accuracy of intrinsic
disorder prediction, it is time to re-examine the abundance of IDPs and IDRs in the archaea domain.
Results: The abundance of IDPs and IDRs in 53 archaea species is analyzed. The amino acid composition profiles
of these species are generally quite different from each other. The disordered content is highly species-dependent.
Thermoproteales proteomes have 14% of disordered residues, while in Halobacteria, this value increases to 34%.
In proteomes of these two phyla, proteins containing long disordered regions account for 12% and 46%, whereas
4% and 26% their proteins are wholly disordered. These three measures of disorder content are linearly correlated
with each other at the genome level. There is a weak correlation between the environmental factors (such as
salinity, pH and temperature of the habitats) and the abundance of intrinsic disorder in Archaea, with various
environmental factors possessing different disorder-promoting strengths. Harsh environmental conditions, especially
those combining several hostile factors, clearly favor increased disorder content. Intrinsic disorder is highly
abundant in functional Pfam domains of the archaea origin. The analysis based on the disordered content and
phylogenetic tree indicated diverse evolution of intrinsic disorder among various classes and species of Archaea.
Conclusions: Archaea proteins are rich in intrinsic disorder. Some of these IDPs and IDRs likely evolve to help
archaea to accommodate to their hostile habitats. Other archaean IDPs and IDRs possess crucial biological
functions similar to those of the bacterial and eukaryotic IDPs/IDRs.

Introduction
Introducing Archaea

It is known that all the living systems on the Earth can
be divided into three large domains, the Bacteria, the
Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing at least two
kingdoms [1-3]. The Bacteria and the Archaea domains

include single-celled microorganisms, prokaryotes.
Although archaea are similar to bacteria phenotypically
(both have no cell nucleus or any other cellular organelles inside their cells and are very often similar in size
and shape), and despite a bacterial organization of
archeae chromosome (messenger RNA with Shine-Dalgarno sequences, genes assembled in operons, a single
origin of bidirectional replication), these two domains of
life are clearly different at the molecular level, and some

of the archaea genes, metabolic pathways and proteins
(especially ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in
transcriptions and translation) are more closely related
to those of eukaryotes [4-11]. For example, all eubacteria
exhibit very similar subunit pattern in their RNA polymerases (in terms of numbers and sizes), whereas this
pattern is not related to that seen in the archaea or the
eukaryotes [4], and several archaea and eukaryotic ribosomal protein homologues have no apparent counterpart among the bacteria [5,6]. On the other hand,
archaea and eukaryotes are sufficiently dissimilar and
diverged early, and, therefore, they could not be placed
in a single domain of life either [1]. Generally speaking,
according to the detailed molecular analysis and comparative genomics, archaea are characterized by a combination of unique properties, such as left-handed
isoprenoids containing glycerolipids, and mosaic bacterial and eukaryotic features [12].
Based on sequences of ribosomal RNAs, archaea were
first classified as a separate group of prokaryotes in
1977 [13]. Before that time prokaryotes were considered
as a single group. The term “archaea” was introduced in
1987 to denote apparent primitive nature of corresponding organisms especially in comparison with the eukaryotes [2]. It is estimated that the total number of phyla
in the archaea domain range from 18 to 23, of which
only 8 phyla have representatives that have been grown
in culture and studied directly [14]. In fact, most of the
culturable and well-investigated species of archaea
belong to the two main phyla, Crenarchaeota, and
Euryarchaeota. Three new phyla, Thaumarchaeota,
Nanoarchaeota, and Korarchaeota, were discovered
very recently. Nanoarchaeota contains a nanosized
symbiotic hyperthermophilic archaeon Nanoarchaeum
equitans from a submarine hot vent, which grows
attached to the surface of a specific archaeal host, a new
member of the genus Ignicoccus[15]. Based on the
small subunit rRNA phylogeny it has been concluded
that Korarchaeota comprises a group of microorganisms that may have diverged early from the major
archaeal phyla Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota,
share many features of both of these main phyla, but are
most closely related to the Crenarchaeota[16]. Members of the Thaumarchaeota phylum are mesophilic
archaea which are different from hyperthermophilic
Crenarchaeota to which they were originally ascribed
[17].
It is recognized now that archaea are an important
component of the biosphere [11], play important roles
in the carbon and nitrogen cycle, and may contribute up
to 20% of the total biomass on Earth [18]. The unique
feature of some archaea is their ability to produce
methane gas in anaerobic environments; i.e., methanogenesis. Another uniqueness of the archaea is their

Page 2 of 21

ability to utilize a great variety of energy sources ranging
from sugars, to using ammonia, sulfur, metal ions and
even hydrogen gas as nutrients; some salt-tolerant
archaea (the Halobacteria) use sunlight as a source of
energy; other archaea use CO2 in the atmosphere as a
source of carbon via the carbon-fixation process, which
is powered by inorganic sources of energy, rather than
by capturing sunlight [19-21]. Many archaea are able to
grow at temperatures above 100 o C and are found in
geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. The archaeon
Methanopyrus kandleri (Strain 116) can effectively grow
at 122°C and high hydrostatic pressure (20 MPa), which
is the highest recorded temperature at which an organism will grow [22]. Others are found in very cold habitats and still others can survive in highly saline, acidic
(at pHs as low as 0, which is equivalent to 1.2 M sulfuric acid), or alkaline water [23]. In addition to these
extremophiles (halophiles, hyperthermophiles, thermophiles, psychrophiles, alkaliphiles, and acidophiles),
many archaea are mesophiles that grow in much milder
conditions, such as marshland, sewage, the oceans, and
soils [24]. Although for a long time Archaea, in particular Crenarchaeota, were considered ecologically insignificant, presuming to occupy mainly extreme and
unusual environments, it is becoming increasingly evident that previously unrecognized members of the
Archaea are abundant, globally distributed, and welladapted to more pedestrian lifestyles and niches, including symbiotic partnership with eukaryotic hosts [25].
Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and
the archaea in plankton (as part of the picoplankton)
may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms
on the planet, accounting for up to 40% of the bacterioplankton in deep ocean waters [26]. Therefore, it has
been pointed out that the study of archaea is essential
to understand the history of molecular mechanisms and
metabolism diversity and to unravel the mechanisms by
which life can sustain in extreme environments [12].
Introducing intrinsically disordered proteins

As verified by an increasing number of experimental
observations, more and more proteins or their regions
have been found to lack unique 3D structure in their
native states under physiological conditions. These
regions and proteins, known as Intrinsically Disordered
Regions (IDR) or Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP)
among different other names [27-30], present in solution as conformational ensembles containing large number of widely different conformations that are in rapid
interconversion on different time scales. The protein
intrinsic disorder phenomenon is rapidly becoming wellaccepted in modern protein science. Unlike structured
proteins, IDPs stay as an ensemble of flexible conformations [27,31-33]. Although without stable 3D structures

Xue et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4(Suppl 1):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/S1/S1

and in contradiction to the traditional sequence-structure-function paradigm, IDPs play a number of crucial
functional roles in living organisms, especially in vital
biological processes, such as signaling, recognition, and
regulation [27,31,32]. According to a statistical study on
SwissProt database, 238 out of 710 SwissProt functional
keywords are strongly positively correlated with intrinsic
disorder, while another 302 functional keywords mostly
characterizing various catalytic activities are strongly
negatively correlated with IDR [34].
Due to their crucial functional roles, IDPs are highly
abundant in all species. According to computational
predictions by PONDR®-VLXT, typically 7-30% prokaryotic proteins contain long disordered regions of more
than 30 consecutive residues, whereas in eukaryotes the
amount of such proteins reaches 45-50% [28,35-38].
Another estimation based on DISOPRED2 achieved
similar results: around 2.0%, 4.2%, and 33.0% of proteins
in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryota have long disordered
segments with 30 or more residues [39]. Higher contents of long IDR were reported in a study using
another computational tool, DisEMBL [40]. In that
study, 23~56%, 15~40%, and 25~78% of proteins in
archaea, bacteria, and eukaryota were predicted to have
IDR longer than 40 residues. In spite of the disagreement between the reported values, the general trend
among the three domains of life is quite consistent: at
the proteome level, eukaryotes have much more disordered proteins than bacteria and archaea. This is a
reflection of the vital roles of IDPs and IDRs in signaling
and regulation. Furthermore, not only at proteome level,
but even in PDB, which is biased to structured proteins,
intrinsic disorder is also very abundant, and almost 70%
of proteins in PDB have IDRs which are indicated by
missing electron density [41].
Despite of the solid proofs of the relative abundance
of IDPs in nature, their origin is still a mystery. Where
are they coming from? How do they evolve? Although
all of the three domains of life have a considerable
amount of intrinsic disorder, modern species have
evolved so effectively that ancient information is no
longer easy to retrieve. In this meaning, archaea could
be an excellent candidate to tell the story of what happened thousands of millions years ago. Since archaea
are prokaryotes (they have no cell nucleus or any other
organelles within the cell), they seem to have appeared
early in the evolution. Furthermore, many archaea live
and grow at extreme conditions, such as high temperature, which are believed to be very similar to the conditions at the early time of planet formation. Finally,
archaea have genes and several metabolic pathways
which are more similar to eukaryotes than bacteria.
Hence, by taking into account the facts that eukaryotes
need more signaling and regulation due to their

Page 3 of 21

biological complexity, and that eukaryotes are highly
enriched in IDRs and IDPs, archaea may provide interesting information about the evolution of intrinsic
disorder.
Previous studies discussed above provided very enlightening information on the abundance of intrinsic disorder in archaea. However, at that time the number of
species available for the bioinformatics analysis was
rather limited. Studies utilizing PONDR®-VLXT, DISOPRED2, and DisEMBL had only 7, 6, and 20 archaea
species, respectively [39,40,42]. This limited number of
species restricted the study on the phylogenetic relations
among the archaea species. Hence, with the expansion
of archaea genome data (more than fifty archaea species
from five different phyla are known now), it is necessary
to re-examine the previous results and to explore new
information. Here, we systematically studied the abundance of intrinsic disorder in archaea and explored the
functional and evolutionary roles of intrinsic disorder in
this domain of life.

Methods
Datasets

All protein sequences from the completed 53 archaea
genome were downloaded from the ExPASy proteomics
server as of Jan. 2009 [43]. The taxonomy of these
archaea is listed in Table S1 (see additional file 1). Note:
In the following discussion, names of phyla are in bold;
names of classes and orders are in bold italic; whereas
names of species are in italic. All five known phyla of
archaea are included in this study: Crenarchaeota and
Euryarchaeota have 15 and 32 species, respectively,
each of the Thaumarchaeota and Nanoarchaeota phyla
has two species; and finally there is only one species in
the Korarchaeota phyla. All the species in Korarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Nanoarchaeota can be
grouped into one class corresponding to that phylum.
Although Crenarchaeota has 15 species, all of these
species also belong to a single class, Thermoprotei.
Hence, these species could be combined together and be
analyzed as a single one. Euryarchaeota is the most
complicated phylum of archaea. It has 7 classes with
one to twelve species in each of them. In order to take
this complexity into consideration, following analysis
will be conducted at three different levels: 5 phyla,
11 classes, and 53 species.
Disorder predictions

In this study, two types of intrinsic disorder predictors
were utilized, per-residue predictors and binary classifiers. Per-residue predictors provide the distribution of
the propensity for intrinsic disorder over the amino acid
sequence, whereas binary classifiers identify entire
protein as wholly ordered or wholly disordered. The

Xue et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4(Suppl 1):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/S1/S1

per-residue predictors were used to generate two means
for the evaluation of abundance of intrinsic disorder in
a given protein, the total amount of disordered residues
and the number of long disordered regions containing
>30 consecutive amino acid residues predicted to be disordered. The binary classifiers were used to evaluate the
number of wholly disordered proteins in a given
proteome.
Per-residue disorder predictions

In this study, per-residue disorder predictors PONDR®VLXT [36] and PONDR®-VSL2 [44] were utilized.

Page 4 of 21

PONDR®-VLXT is the first disorder predictor which was
designed by using neural networks. It is very sensitive to
the changes of local compositional profile. One of its
prominent properties is the frequently occurring dips on
the plot of disorder score (see Figure 1). These dips correspond to hydrophobic segments with the increased
propensity to order that are flanked by disordered
regions. many of these segments are found to be very
important in molecular recognition, signaling and regulation. They are now recognized as a Molecular Recognition Feature (MoRF) [38,45]. PONDR®-VSL2 is

is the disorder score of PONDR-VLXT, while the dashed line is from PONDR-VSL2. The line at (a) shows a dip in VLXT prediction while VSL2
predicts the long segment to be disordered. The circle in (b) represents a long disordered region predicted by VLXT, but missed by VSL2.

Xue et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4(Suppl 1):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/S1/S1

composed of a set of support vector machines and was
trained on datasets containing disordered regions of various lengths. It is one of the most accurate predictors
developed so far. Both PONDR®-VLXT and VSL2 have
been applied in genome-wide studies on protein intrinsic disorder. The results of these analyses clearly indicated the existence of noticeable differences between
these two predictors. However, the sources of these differences and their underlying biological significance
have not been clearly uncovered as of yet. Figure 1
represents the illustrative example of the disorder evaluation by PONDR®-VLXT and PONDR®-VSL2 predictors in two unrelated proteins. This figure illustrates the
typical feature of the PONDR®-VLXT plot which contains many sharp dips. As a result, long disordered
regions are divided into a series of short disordered
regions by these dips. Consequently, PONDR®-VLXT
may under-estimate the ratio of long disordered regions
as shown in Figure 1(a). On the other hand, although
PONDR®-VSL2 is more accurate than PONDR®-VLXT
on short disordered/structured regions, it was also
trained using a set of short protein segments. As a
result, for proteins that tend to have intersected disordered/structured segments, PONDR®-VSL2 may also
have lower ratio for long disordered regions as indicated
by Figure 1(b). Hence, it would be beneficial to combine
the results of several different predictors. However, in
this study, due to reasons discussed above, we will focus
on the results from the PONDR®-VSL2.
Binary disorder classification

Based on the per-residue disorder prediction, a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) can be obtained to
describe the disorder status of the entire protein
[37,42,46]. Basically, CDF is based on a cumulated histogram of disordered residues at various disorder scores.
By definition, structured proteins will have more structured residues and less disordered residues. Therefore,
the CDF curve of a structured protein will increase very
quickly on the side of low disorder score, and then go
flat on the side of high disorder score. On the other
hand, for disordered proteins, the CDF curve will move
upward slightly in regions of low disorder score, then
rapidly increase in the regions with high disorder scores.
Hence, on the 2D CDF plot, structured proteins tend to
be located in the upper left half, whereas disordered
proteins are predominantly located at the lower right
half of the plot. By comparing the locations of CDF
curves for a group of fully disordered and fully structured proteins, a boundary line between these two
groups of proteins can be identified. Then, this boundary can be used to classify any given protein as wholly
ordered or wholly disordered. Proteins whose CDF
curves are above the boundary line are mostly structured, whereas proteins with CDF curves located below

Page 5 of 21

the boundary are mostly disordered [37,42,46]. The distance of a curve from the CDF boundary can also be
used as a kind of measure of the disordered (structured)
status of a protein. This distance is further referred as
CDF-distance. Originally, CDF analysis was developed
based on the results of the PONDR®-VLXT [28].
Recently, other five CDF predictors were built using the
outputs of the PONDR®-VSL2 [44], PONDR®-VL3 [47],
IUPred [48], FoldIndex [49], and TopIDP [50]. Among
these various CDFs, PONDR®-VSL2-CDF achieved the
highest accuracy, 5-10% higher than the accuracy of the
second best predictor [46].
Another method of measuring the disordered status of
the entire protein is a Charge-Hydropathy (CH) plot
[29]. CH-plot takes the averaged Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity [51] and an absolute mean net charge of a
protein chain as the coordinates of the X- and Y-axis,
respectively. This plot represents each protein as a single point in such a 2D graph. Since extended disordered
proteins typically contain fewer hydrophobic residues
and more charged residues than ordered proteins, these
two types occupy different areas in the CH-phase diagram and can even be separated by a linear boundary
[29]. According to this analysis, all of the proteins
located above this boundary line are highly likely to be
disordered, whereas proteins below this line are structured. On the CH-plot, the vertical distance from the
location of a protein to the boundary line is then taken
as a scale of disorder (or structure) tendency of a protein. This distance is further referred as CH-distance.
CDF- and CH-plots have different underlying principles. The CDF-plot, being based on the disorder predictors of the PONDR® family, is strongly related to the
method of machine learning. Essentially, it is a statistical
analysis based on known structures in PDB. The CH
measurement has a very intuitive physicochemical background. Charged residues intend to interact with solvent
molecules, while hydrophobic residues prefer to avoid
contacts with solvent, therefore aggregating together.
Hence, the CH-distance provides very important information about the general compactness and conformation of a polypeptide chain. By combining CDF- and
CH-distances in one graph, we have another method
called the CH-CDF-plot [37,52]. On this plot, each
point corresponds to a single protein and represents its
CDF-distance at the X-axis and the CH-distance at the
Y-axis. CH>0 and CH<0 denote proteins predicted to be
disordered and ordered by the CH-plot, respectively. On
the other hand, values of CDF>0 represent structured
proteins, and CDF<0 correspond to disordered proteins.
Hence, the entire field can be divided into four quadrants by cutting lines CH=0 and CDF=0. Lower right
quadrant corresponds to proteins predicted to be structured by both CH and CDF, whereas upper left

Results and discussion
Major characteristics of the Archaea proteomes

Archaea are very abundant in nature, play a number of
important roles in the cycle of carbon and nitrogen on
earth [18]. Although most of archaea live in ocean,
many of these microbes are extremophiles since they
live, grow and prosper in extremely harsh environments, such environments of highly salty lakes or hot/
boiling springs. For the cells of “normal” organisms
(e.g., mammals), these types of environment are absolutely lethal, since high temperatures or high salt concentrations will inevitably denature proteins of these
organisms, invalidate their functions, and terminate
crucial biological pathways, eventually leading to the
cell death. However, compared to these normal cells,
archaea developed special mechanisms to counteract
the harmful influence of these environments. The
major components involved in these protective
mechanisms should directly target the most abundant
bio-substance: proteins. Therefore, the comparative
analysis of proteomes of various species living at various habitats should provide crucial information on the
similarities and differences of these organisms and on
the mechanisms of the adaptation.
Figure 2 presents the size distribution of proteomes of
various archaea species analyzed in this study. Although
15 species in the first phylum, Crenarchaeota, belong
to the same class, they can be divided into three orders:
the first order is Desulfurococcales with 4 species; the
second order is Sulfolobales having another 4 species;
and the last order is Thermoproteales which contains 7

No. of Proteins

To gain insight into the relationships between sequence
and disorder, the amino acid compositions of Archaea
proteomes were compared using an approach developed
for the analysis of intrinsically disordered proteins
[28,53]. To this end, the fractional difference in composition between a given protein set (an Archaean proteome), and proteins from the Fully Disordered Dataset
(FDD) [46,54] was calculated for each amino acid residues as described in [28,53]. The fractional difference
was calculated as (CX-CFDD)/CFDD, where CX is the content of a given amino acid in a given proteome, and
C FDD is the corresponding content in FDD proteins.
These fractional differences for each proteome are then
plotted for each amino acid. This analysis was performed using a Composition Profiler, a computational
tool that automates this task and graphically summarizes
the results [53]. Composition Profiler is available at
http://profiler.cs.ucr.edu.

species. After this division is taken into account, the
trends in the proteome sizes of these 15 species became
obvious. Figure 2 shows that the members of the Desulfurococcales order are relatively uniform and have the
smallest proteomes size in this phylum. Two other
orders (Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales) still possess
large variability in their proteome sizes. In Euryarchaeota, as shown by taxonomy (2.1) – (2.7) and corresponding proteome size in Figure 2, Halobacteria has
the largest proteomes; Methanococci and Thermococci
have fewer proteins in their proteomes; whereas Methanomicrobia have the largest fluctuations in proteome
size among various species. Apparently, all the species
with small proteomes are characterized by a globule-like
morphology. The relatively large number of proteins in
Halobacteria is also expected, since extra proteins may
be needed to help these species deal with the high concentrations of ions in their environment. Finally, Uncultured methanogenic archaeon which belong to the
Euryarchaeota phylum has more than 3000 proteins
and ranks as one of the largest proteomes in Archaea.
Korarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota have middle-sized
proteomes. Nanoarchaeota have the only representative
Nanoarchaeum equitans, which is the simplest species
in Archaea being characterized by the smallest proteome
and having only 536 proteins.

Length
Figure 3 Length distribution of proteins in five phyla (a) and eight classes (b) of Euryarchaeota. X-axis: “X” length of protein; Y-axis:
percentage of proteins with “X” length. The upper limit of the x-axis is taken as 1500 residues for visualization purposes. However, there are still
scattered distributions of proteins beyond this uplimit.

Not only the size of proteome is important, but also
the size of proteins in each genome. The length distributions for 5 phyla and 7 classes of Euryarchaeota
phylum are shown in Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b),
respectively. Clearly, in general, distributions of protein
length among all the species are very similar, although
some important subtle differences can be found. The
general shape of the distribution is similar to the power-

law distribution. All of the species have less than 2%
extremely short proteins (less than 50aa). The most
optimal protein length for all species is around 100 –
200 residues. Proteins with these lengths constitute
approximately 25% of any given proteome. Larger proteins are also very common in all the species: the content of proteins longer than 500aa is around 10% or
even higher. Very long proteins (longer than 1000 aa)

Xue et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4(Suppl 1):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/S1/S1

are not very common and account for several percent,
comparable to the proportion of the extremely short
proteins. As shown in Figure 3(a), Thaumarchaeota
and Korarchaeota have fewer extremely short and short
proteins. However, the members of the Korarchaeota
phylum have more middle-sized proteins (150 – 250aa),
whereas Thaumarchaeota have more proteins with
250 – 500 residues. In addition, Nanoarchaeota has
around 5% percent more middle-sized proteins with
50 – 100 residues. In Figure 3(b), Archaeoglobi and
Halobacteria have around 4 times more extremely
short proteins than the other 5 classes. The other 5
classes are enriched in longer proteins with 250 – 450

residues. In Methanococci, the content of proteins with
50 – 450 residues is always the highest.
Amino acid compositions of the Archaea proteomes

At the next stage, the amino acid compositions of proteins from various Archaea were analyzed. The results
of this analysis are shown in Figure 4 as the relative
composition profiles calculated for various species as
described by Vacic and colleagues [53]. Here, the fractional difference in composition between a given protein
set and a set of completely disordered proteins was calculated for each amino acid residue. The fractional difference was evaluated as (CX-CFDD)/CFDD, where CX is

the content of a given amino acid in a given protein set,
and CFDD is the corresponding content in the Fully Disordered Dataset (FDD) [46,54]. The usefulness of this
analysis is determined by the fact that the propensity of
a given protein to be intrinsically disordered is determined by a set of specific features of its amino acid
sequence and composition [28,29,50,53,55]. For example,
intrinsically disordered proteins are significantly
depleted in bulky hydrophobic (I, L, and V) and aromatic amino acid residues (W, Y, and F), which would
normally form the hydrophobic core of a folded globular
protein, and also possess a low content of C and N residues. These depleted residues, I, L, V, W, F, Y, C and
N, were proposed to be called order-promoting amino
acids. On the other hand, intrinsically disordered proteins and regions were shown to be substantially
enriched in disorder-promoting amino acids: E, K, R, G,
Q, S, P and A.
Application of this tool to the analysis of the Archaea
proteomes revealed a number of interesting features.
Figure 4(a) clearly shows that all 5 phyla contain many
more structure-promoting residues (W, C, F, I, Y, V, L)
and fewer disorder-promoting residues (Q, S, P, E, K)
than the FDD proteins. In Figure 4(a), the content of F,
I, Q, P, E, and K are rather consistent between the 5
phyla, where compared to FDD isoleucine had the highest abundance in all 5 phyla. By comparing each phylum, Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota have more
similarity with each other. They both have a low content
of cystein, but are rich in tryptophan. In comparison
with other phyla, they are also very similar in their content of H, T, R, and D. Figure 4(b) shows that the contents of L, Q, S, and P are stable among various classes
of Euryarchaeota. Halobacteria are very special due to
their low content of structure-promoting residues (C, F,
I, and Y), abnormally large increments in A, T, R, G,
and D, and a dramatic decrease in K abundance.
Methanococci show a large increase in (I, N, and K)

and a noticeable decrease in (H, A, and R). Methanopyri show a very large increase in V, and R, and a
decrease in S, N, and K. Thermoplasmata have much
more I, Y, and M than other classes.
Table 1 presents the averaged Kullback-Leibler
[54,56,57] divergence among all the phyla and classes.
As stated in our previous study, values below 0.01 correspond to high similarities between two datasets; values
between 0.01 and 0.05 indicate a gray zone; values larger
than 0.05 correspond to the datasets which are unlikely
to be similar; and values greater than 0.1 correspond to
the non-similar datasets [54]. This Table provides a very
straightforward description of the similarity among the
various Archaea species and shows that several species
are similar to each other in terms of their amino acid
compositions.
Disorder distribution in the Archaea proteomes

The differences in the protein length distributions
among the proteomes of various Archaea and in their
amino acid compositions lead to another important
question: Is intrinsic disorder distributed evenly in all
these species or not? The comparison of various disorder contents among 53 species is shown in Figure 5,
where the amount of disorder in different Archea proteomes is annotated as the percentage of predicted disordered residues (Figure 5(a)), the amount of long
disordered regions (Figure 5(b)), and the amount of
wholly disordered proteins (Figure 5(c)). Figure 5 clearly
shows that Crenarchaeota have a relatively lower content of disorder than the other four phyla. On the other
hand, Korarchaeota have the highest disorder content.
In Euryarchaeota, the ratios diverged: Halobacteria
have much higher disorder content than other species
and Thermococci have the lowest disorder content.
These observations indicated the influence of environment on the abundance of intrinsic disorder in a given
organism. Halobacteria need to be more adaptive in

ordered proteins to resist the influence of high environment temperature.
Figure 5(d) represents the relation among the various
means used to evaluate the disorder content in the
Archaea proteomes. As shown by this plot, the total
number of disordered residues, the amount of long
IDRs, and the number of wholly disordered IDPs are

well-correlated at the proteome level. In other words,
this analysis clearly shows that the proteomes with the
larger total amount of disordered residues typically contain a larger amount of long disordered regions and larger number of wholly disordered proteins.
To better understand the distribution of wholly disordered proteins in various Archaea proteomes, we further
analyzed their CH-CDF phase space. The averaged data

are shown in Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b), respectively.
As shown by Figure 6(a), the averaged CH-distance
values are decreasing, while averaged CDF-distances are
increasing in the order of Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, Korarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota. This trend indicates the correspondingly
decreased content of charged residues, increased content
of structured-promoting residues, or a combination of

these two factors. Error bars give the estimation of the
distribution of all the relevant distances for that species.
Apparently, larger error bars correspond to a broader
distribution. Hence, while the distributions of CDF-distances are similar among all five phyla, Thaumarchaeota has broadest distribution of the CH-distances. In
Figure 6(b), Halobacteria and Methanopyri have
obviously larger averaged CH-distance and smaller

Intrinsic disorder and habitats of the Archaea

In order to understand a correlation between the
abundance of IDPs in various Archaea and their natural
habitats, we searched for several environmental characteristics, such as optimal salinity, optimal pH and optimal temperature (see Table S1 in Additional file 1).

averaged CDF-distance than other 5 classes. Halobacteria has much broader distribution of the CDF-distances. The other 5 Thaumarchaeota classes have
somewhat overlapped values.
The abundance of intrinsically disordered proteins in
various Archaea proteomes is further illustrated by Figures S1 and S2 (see additional file 1) which represent
CH-CDF plots for Archaea phyla (Additional file 1, Figure S1) and for the 8 Euryarchaeota classes (Additional
file 1, Figure S2). In these plots, each spot corresponds
to a single protein and its coordinates are calculated as
a distance of this protein from the boundary in the corresponding CH-plot (Y-coordinate) and an averaged
distance of the corresponding CDF curve from the
boundary (X-coordinate). Positive and negative Y values
correspond to proteins which, according to CH-plot
analysis, are predicted to be natively unfolded or compact, respectively. Whereas positive and negative X
values are attributed to proteins that, by the CDF analysis, are predicted to be ordered or intrinsically disordered, respectively. Therefore, each plot contains four
quadrants: (-, -) contains proteins predicted to be disordered by CDF, but compact by CH-plot (i.e., proteins
with molten globule-like properties); (-, +) includes proteins predicted to be disordered by both methods (i.e.,
random coils and pre-molten globules); (+, -) contains
ordered proteins; (+, +) includes proteins predicted to
be disordered by CH-plot, but ordered by the CDF analysis. Both figures also give the number of proteins
found in the corresponding quadrants. Analysis of the
(-, -) and (-, +) quadrants in Additional file 1, Figure S1
shows that the majority of the wholly disordered proteins from Crenarchaeota, Korarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, and Thaumarchaeota likely possess molten
globule-like properties. In contrast, the proteomes of
Nanoarchaeota are generally characterized by a more
balanced distribution between compact and extended
disordered proteins. The analysis of these two quadrants
in the Euryarchaeota phylum (see Figure S2 in Additional file 1) shows that proteomes of Archaeoglobi,
Methanococci, Methanomicrobia, Methanopyri, Thermococci, and UNCMA all have more molten globulelike IDPs than extended IDPs. The situation is reversed
in Halobacteria and Thermoplasmata which are predicted to have more extended IDPs than native molten
globules.

as a function of optimal pH. We used three measures of

large disorder diversity. On the other hand, all the acidophilic Archaea are characterized by the relatively low
abundance of intrinsic disorder, whereas the only alkaliphile, Natronomonas pharaonis, has the highest content
of intrinsic disorder as measured by the overall number
of disordered residues, the number of long disordered
regions and the number of completely disordered proteins in its proteome.
The dependence of the disorder content in the
Archaea on the salinity of their habitats is shown in Figure 8, which clearly shows that all the halophiles are
characterized by a very large amount of disorder. This
observation supports the notion that extra IDPs are
likely to be needed to these species to help them dealing
with the high concentrations of ions in their environment. Of special interest is a Cenarchaeum symbiosum,
which live in the low salinity environments but is still
characterized by high abundance of IDPs (see circled
point in Figure 8). The peculiar difference of this organism is that this symbiotic archaeon is a psychrophilic
crenarchaeon which inhabits a marine sponge. Another
peculiar organism with large amount of disorder is
Methanopyrus kandleri (see squared point in Figure 8).
Although the living environment of this archaeon is
characterized by the normal salinity, it is known to grow
at the hostile conditions of very high temperatures
(between 100 and 110°C) and high hydrostatic pressure.
In fact, Methanopyrus kandleri was isolated from the
overheated walls of the black smoker from the Gulf of
California found at the depth of 2000 m.
Finally, Figure 9 represents the dependence of the
amount of disorder in various Archaea as a function of
temperature of their habitats. Figure 9 shows that generally there is a slight negative correlation between these
two parameters. The obvious exceptions from this trend
are halophilic proteomes (see squared points in Figure 9),
as well as already discussed Methanopyrus kandler (see
triangled point in Figure 9) and Cenarchaeum symbiosum
(see circled point in Figure 9).
Altogether, data represented in Figure 7, 8 and 9 show
that the amount of intrinsic disorder in Archaea correlates with the peculiarities of their environment. Generally, organisms prospering at the extremely hazardous
conditions (such as very high temperature, highly alkaline pH, very high salinity) are enriched in IDPs. Of special interest is the fact that various environmental
factors possess different strength in promoting intrinsic
disorder. For example, organisms living in an extremely
hostile, highly acidic environment possess relatively low
amount of disorder. Even proteins of the archaeon
Picrophilus torridus which lives in and grows at the lowest pH values known among all organisms, including
conditions such as 1 M sulfuric acid, effectively grows
only below pH 3.5 (optimal pH = 0.7) and possesses

significant growth even at a pH around 0, contain only
15% of disordered residues. On the other hand, among
the most prominent enhancers of intrinsic disorder are
habitats with very high salinity and alkaline pH. The
combination of extremely high temperature and high
hydrostatic pressure potentially also represent environment favoring intrinsic disorder. Another strong

disorder-promoting factor is the symbiotic life style. All
this suggests that intrinsic disorder can be used by the
Archaean organisms to better adjust for their harsh living conditions or, in the case the symbiotic microbes,
for the accommodation to the conditions inside the
sponge and for better communication with the cells of
the host.

Earlier studies clearly showed that protein intrinsic disorder is of great functional importance [27,31,32]. Proteins often contain one or more functional domains,
different combinations of which give rise to the diverse
range of proteins found in nature. It has been recognized that the identification of domains that occur
within proteins can therefore provide insights into their
function. To find a correlation between intrinsic disorder and function in the Archaea proteins we analyzed
the abundance of intrinsic disorder in the Pfam database, which contains information on protein domains
and families and uses hidden Markov models and multiple sequence alignments to identify members of its
families emphasizing the evolutionary conservation of
protein domains [58-60]. Each curated family in Pfam is
represented by a seed and full alignment. The seed contains representative members of the family, while the
full alignment contains all members of the family as
detected with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM)
[58]. Since Pfam represent an important tool for understanding protein structure and function and since this
database contains large amount of information on functional domains, the Archaea seed domains in the version
23.0 of the Pfam database were analyzed. There are
more than 12,700 Pfam domain seeds of the Archaean
origin, which vary in length from 16 to 1462 residues,
whereas the mean length of the Archaean Pfam domains
is 156 residues (Figure S3, in Additional file 1).
Figure S4 in Additional file 1 ) shows that intrinsic disorder is rather abundant in the Archaean Pfam seed
domains. On average, 15.4 % of residues in functional
domains of the Archaea origin are predicted to be disordered (Figure S4A). In fact, several Archaean domains are
completely disordered and only ~2,000 domains are completely devoid disordered regions (Figure S4A, additional
file 1). Many of the domains contain at least one disordered region, with some domains possessing more than 10
disordered regions (Figure S4B, Additional file 1). The
length of disordered regions in the domains varies from 1
to 201 residues (Figure S4C, Additional file 1).
The intrinsic disorder propensity among the Archaean
members of the Pfam database is further illustrated by
Figure S5 (see Additional file 1) which represents a
three dimensional plot of total percent disorder, disordered region length (where there are up to 26 disordered regions per domain), and domain length for all
Archaea seed domains in version 23.0 of the Pfam database. Figure S6 (see Additional file 1) represents the
data as a three dimensional plot of the log of the number of disordered regions, the log of the number of disordered residues, and the log of the percent disorder in
each of all of the Archaea seed domains in version 23.0
of the Pfam database. In this plot, all domains with one

Xue et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4(Suppl 1):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/S1/S1

disordered region are represented in the cluster on the
left. Domains with between ten and 26 disordered
regions are represented at 1 and above on the right.
Domains with no disordered regions are not included.
These figures suggest that there is a weak correlation
between percent disorder and disordered region length,
but no correlation between these observations and Pfam
domain length.
Therefore, data presented here clearly show that many
functional domains in Archaea are predicted to contain
various amounts of disordered residues. Table 2 lists
several domains with high disorder content and shows
that these intrinsically disordered domains play crucial
roles in interaction with RNA, DNA, and proteins and
are important for recognition, regulation and signal
transduction. In other words, Archaean disordered
domains fulfill functions similar to those of prokaryotic
and eukaryotic proteins [27,31,32].
Further evidence on the biological importance of
intrinsic disorder found in the archaea proteins is given
by Figure 10 which illustrates predicted and experimentally verified disordered regions in the Archaea translation initiation factor 2 (aIF2). aIF2 facilitates translation
by recruiting methonyl-tRNA to the ribosome and aiding in the identification of the start codon, hydrolyzing
GTP in the process [61]. aIF2 consists of three subunits:
regulatory a and b subunits, and the GTP hydrolyzing g
subunit. aIF2b of Sulfolobus solfataricus is an intrinsically disordered protein consisting of both ordered and
disordered regions (Figure S5, see additional file 1). The
N-terminus of aIF2b has been shown to be disordered
[62] and also in the homologous protein from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum[63]. However, this
region is responsible for mediating binding to aIF2g
through a MoRF-type interaction. This interaction is
shown in Figure 10, where the aIF2g binding region corresponds to a local prediction of order in the N-terminus of aIF2b. Additionally, aIF2b has a central core
domain and a C-terminal zinc finger domain, both of
which play roles in RNA recognition [64]. Presumably

Page 15 of 21

the MoRF interaction provides flexibility to these
domains to facilitate molecular recognition [64].
Phylogenetic tree of the Archaea and intrinsic disorder

Figure 11 overlaps the disorder content of various species with the Archaea phylogenetic tree. In this figure,
colors of the branches correspond to the abundance of
disordered residues in the corresponding species.
Clearly, as indicated by the same color on the related
branches of the tree, proteomes belonging to the same
phylum typically have comparable contents of disordered residues in their proteins. For example, all the
species in the Crenarchaeota phylum are characterized
by the relatively small amount of disordered proteins,
containing in average ~15% intrinsically disordered
amino acids (IDAA). The correlation is even stronger
for species belonging to the same order, where the
amount of intrinsic disorder remains relatively constant.
For example, all the species from the Thermoproteales
order have low IDAA content (less than 14%). This
value increases to ~16% in various Sulfolobales and
further increases to up to 20% in Desulfurococcales.
Analysis of the Eutyarchaeota phylum also revealed a
comparable trend in the distribution of IDAA. Here, all
the members of the Archaeoglobi, Halobacteria,
Methanococci, and Methanomicrobia, contain a relatively high amount of disorder (ranging from ~16 to
~36%). Once again, each Eutyarchaeota class was characterized by the relatively uniform distribution of disorder: for example, the amount of disorder in the
Halobacteria ranged from 32 to 35.6%, whereas Methanomicrobia contained from 16.7 to 20.1 % IDAA.
Interestingly, Figure 11 provides some insights into
the correlation between the evolution of Archaea and
the intrinsic disorder distribution in these organisms. In
the Methanococci – Methanopyri – Thermococci
branch, Methanoccoci deviated first from other Archaea
with the high IDAA of ~20%. Later on, Methanopyri
left the main branch with ratio of IDAA up to 27%.
Although Thermococci generally possess a relatively low

Figure 10 PONDR® prediction and experimentally solved structure of aIF2b from Sulfolobus solfataricus. The PONDR® VSL2 prediction is
given in the plot, where scores greater than 0.5 are predictions of disordered residues and scores less then 0.5 are predictions of ordered
residues. Horizontal bars represent regions with known structure, or are likely to be structured, which are (from N- to C- termini): the aIF2gbinding MoRF region (red bar), the core domain (cyan bar), and the C-terminal zinc finger domain (green bar). Additionally, structures of the
aIF2g-binding MoRF region (red ribbon) bound to aIF2g (blue surface) and aIF2a (green surface), and of the core domain (cyan ribbon) are
shown (coordinates from PDB entries 2QN6 and 2NXU, respectively).

amount of disorder in comparison with other members
of this branch, Pyrococcus horikoshi being close to
Methanoccoci and Methanopyri, is characterized by the
highest disorder content (~18%), whereas other members of this class are close to the Crenarchaeota phylum and are correspondingly characterized by the lower
amount of disorder (~16%). In the Crenarchaeota phylum, where the majority of members are characterized
by the disorder content ranging from 12.5 to 14.0%,
Hyperthermus butylicus, Thermofilum pendens, and
Aeropyrum pernix, all located in the close branches,
which deviated from the major branch relatively late,
possess 17-20% IDAA. Therefore, these observations
suggest that in general the amount of disorder increases
with evolution. There is only one counter-example to
this rule, which is found in the class of Methanoicrobia,
where Methanocorpusculum labreanum is not the oldest
species in that class, but has an apparently lower content of disordered residues than other older species.

Need for the habitat-specific disorder predictors

Data presented in this paper indicate that there is a correlation between the amount of intrinsic disorder in a
proteome of a given archaeaon and the peculiarities of
its habitat. Intriguingly, not only the amounts of intrinsic disorder in the proteomes of archaea prospering in
various hostile conditions are different and depend on
the environmental peculiarities, proteins of these proteomes possess a number of environment-dependent
characteristic features (e.g., specific biases in the amino
acid compositions). Data shown in Figure 4(b) suggest
that these sequence features are unique and different
enough to potentially allow the development of habitatspecific predictors of intrinsic disorder for archaea.
In fact, this hypothesis is in agreement with our recent
study of integral transmembrane proteins which
revealed that the disordered regions from helical bundle
integral membrane proteins, those from b-barrel integral
membrane proteins, and those from water soluble

increased. Numbers nearby the species name represent the relative content of disordered residues in that species. Colors of the tree are

proteins all exhibit statistically distinct amino acid compositional biases [54]. Although the detailed analysis
showed that, despite these differences in composition,
current algorithms make reasonably accurate predictions
of disorder for these membrane proteins, it has been
proposed that developing new predictors that make use
of data from disordered regions in helical bundles and
beta barrels will likely lead to significantly more accurate
disorder predictions for these two classes of integral
membrane proteins [54].

Conclusions
In this paper, we systematically analyzed the abundance
of intrinsically disordered proteins and the intrinsically
disordered regions in 53 Archaea species, which are
grouped into 5 phyla and 11 classes. The size of proteomes of these species extends from 536 proteins to
4,234 proteins with the majority of Archaea having
around 2,000 proteins. The abundance of intrinsic disorder was species-dependent. The averaged ratio of
predicted disordered residues varied from ~14% in
Thermoproteales to ~34% in Halobacteria. Further

analysis based on amino acid composition profiles confirmed large differences between various species. However, even between closely related species, the content of
disordered residues changed greatly. Staphylothermus
marinus and Ignicoccus hospitalis are two species in the
same order Desulfurococcales of the Thermoprotei class
in the Crenarchaeota phylum, but Ignicoccus hospitalis
had 7% more disordered residues than Staphylothermus
marinus. In Thermoproteales of the same phylum and
class, Thermofilum pendens had around 6% more disordered residues than Caldivirga maquilingensis.
The relation between various measures of disordered
content; i.e., the relative content of disordered residues,
the content of proteins containing long disordered
regions, and the number of fully disordered proteins was
also analyzed. All of these measures of intrinsic disorder
content are shown to be linearly correlated with each
other at the genome level. This relationship provided
important information for the general understanding of
disordered proteins. However, more computational
experiments are needed to verify this conclusion since
this result comes from the predictions on 53 species.

Next we analyzed the correlation between the abundance of intrinsic disorder in a given Archaeaon and
peculiarities of its habitat. Since many of the Archaea
are know to survive at extremely harsh environmental
conditions, this exercise was interesting and important.
Analysis revealed that various environmental factors
possessed different strength in promoting intrinsic disorder. The most prominent enhancers of intrinsic disorder were habitats with very high salinity, alkaline pH or
characterized by the combination of extremely high
temperature and high hydrostatic pressure. Symbiotic
archaeaon, Cenarchaeum symbiosum, was also shown to
contain high level of intrinsically disordered proteins.
This clearly suggested that Archaea generally utilized
intrinsic disorder for adjustment to their living
conditions.
Many functional Pfam seed domains of the Archaea
origin were shown to possess various levels of intrinsic
disorder. Only about 15% of these functional domains
were completely devoid of disorder. Disordered Pfam
domains were involved in various crucial functions, such
as signaling, regulation and interaction with nucleic
acids and proteins, suggesting that similar to proteins
from other domains of life, intrinsic disorder is heavily
used by the Archaean proteins in their functions.
We also designed a new protocol by combining disorder predictions and phylogenetic tree to show the correlation between evolutionary development and disorder.
A gradual increase in the amount of intrinsic disorder
with the evolution of species was observed. More interestingly, the ratios of disordered residues can also be
reduced in the process of evolution. Based on the
hypothesis that disordered proteins are crucial for signaling and regulation, it is not difficult to understand
the need for an increased level of intrinsic disorder in
newly evolved species. However, data for Methanocorpusculum labreanum raised the question on whether
the decreased amount of intrinsic disorder found in this
organism can be considered as an atavism. In fact, one
of the Methanocorpusculum labreanum paralogues,
Methanosaete thermophila, has a smaller proteome but
higher content of disordered residues, whereas two
other paralogues, Methanoculleus marisnigri and Methanospirillum hungatai, have a higher content of disordered residues and larger proteomes.
