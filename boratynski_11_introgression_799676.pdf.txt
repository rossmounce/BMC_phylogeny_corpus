Introgression of mitochondrial DNA among
Myodes voles: consequences for energetics?

Abstract
Background: Introgression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is among the most frequently described cases of
reticulate evolution. The tendency of mtDNA to cross interspecific barriers is somewhat counter-intuitive
considering the key function of enzymes that it encodes in the oxidative-phosphorylation process, which could
give rise to hybrid dysfunction. How mtDNA reticulation affects the evolution of metabolic functions is, however,
uncertain. Here we investigated how morpho-physiological traits vary in natural populations of a common rodent
(the bank vole, Myodes glareolus) and whether this variation could be associated with mtDNA introgression. First,
we confirmed that M. glareolus harbour mtDNA introgressed from M. rutilus by analyzing mtDNA (cytochrome b,
954 bp) and nuclear DNA (four markers; 2333 bp in total) sequence variation and reconstructing loci phylogenies
among six natural populations in Finland. We then studied geographic variation in body size and basal metabolic
rate (BMR) among the populations of M. glareolus and tested its relationship with mtDNA type.
Results: Myodes glareolus and its arctic neighbour, M. rutilus, are reciprocally monophyletic at the analyzed nuclear
DNA loci. In contrast, the two northernmost populations of M. glareolus have a fixed mitotype that is shared with
M. rutilus, likely due to introgressive hybridization. The analyses of phenotypic traits revealed that the body mass
and whole-body, but not mass corrected, BMR are significantly reduced in M. glareolus females from northern
Finland that also have the introgressed mitotype. Restricting the analysis to the single population where the
mitotypes coexist, the association of mtDNA type with whole-body BMR remained but those with mass corrected
BMR and body mass did not. Mitochondrial sequence variation in the introgressed haplotypes is compatible with
demographic growth of the populations, but may also be a result of positive selection.
Conclusion: Our results show that the phenotypic traits vary markedly along the north-south axis of populations
of M. glareolus. This variation may be related to adaptation to local environments and coincides with the gradient
of genome reticulation between M. glareolus and M. rutilus, which was assessed by mtDNA introgression.
Introgression of mtDNA may have affected morpho-physiological traits but do not show strong effects on either
body mass or basal metabolic rate alone. We discuss the causes and biological meaning of our results and the
means to clarify these questions in future research.

Background
Widely distributed species face different selection pressures along climatic and ecological gradients. In this
respect, basal metabolic rate (BMR) is particularly prone
to evolve adaptively, since it has been shown to be heritable and correlates with fitness components in
endotherms [1-8]. Several comparative studies have proposed that patterns of variation in metabolic rate match

certain climatic variables in widely distributed groups of
species [9,10], suggesting that the level of BMR responds
to different selection regimes generated by local conditions. BMR is generated mainly in physiologically important internal organs including the kidneys, brain and
liver [11,12] with most of the physiological activity localized in certain compartments of cells in these organs.
Mitochondria are the main cellular energy “factories”,
supplying organisms with energy stored in ATP molecules. The rate of energy production by mitochondria is
crucial for an individual’s fitness and is thought to be
determined by natural selection [13-15]. Mitochondria

are characterized by their own genome and harbour
enzymatic elements of aerobic metabolic pathways.
However, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the
process responsible for energy production, depends not
only on the enzymes encoded in the internal organelle
genome (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA]), but also on
nuclear-encoded polypeptides which interact to enable
the enzymatic reactions. Therefore, selection may act on
and constrain the co-evolution of mitochondrial and
nuclear genes [16]. Interestingly, between-species transfer of mtDNA has been frequently observed among
many group of animals and plants [17-22]. Such transfer
has been traditionally considered neutral, however, it
may be maladaptive, if introgression breaks the coevolved mito-nuclear complexes [16], or adaptive, as
mtDNA function may represent important selective
value [23-26].
Interspecific mtDNA transfer observed among the
broadly distributed rodent genus Myodes [27-30] offers
an ideal situation to test 1) if reticulate evolution has an
important and recognizable phenotypic effect and 2)
whether natural selection may influence mtDNA introgression. The bank vole, Myodes glareolus, is dispersed
across different climatic and geographic zones, from the
Mediterranean to beyond the Arctic Circle [29,31] (Figure 1). The distribution of its close relative, the northern

Page 2 of 12

red-backed vole (or red vole), M. rutilus, is restricted to
northern parts of the circum-boreal zone, extending to
the Arctic zone [29,32]. The red vole occurs from northern Fennoscandia and northern Eurasia, where it is
partly sympatric with the bank vole, to the northern latitudes in North America. Introgressive hybridization
between the bank vole and the red vole has been documented across a vast geographic area, from Sweden to
central and southern Russia [33,34] including northern
Finland [27]. All these cases showed introgression of
mtDNA alone and no introgression of the nuclear genome has been reported [27,28].
In this work we revisited a geographic region where
mtDNA introgression between M. glareolus and M. rutilus has been previously described [27]. First, using
sequence data both from mtDNA and nuclear DNA, we
confirm that mtDNA introgression from M. rutilus into
M. glareolus occurs naturally in Finland, with the introgressed haplotype being fixed in the northernmost
populations. Since the mitochondria house the energy
machinery of the cells, we analyzed variation in two
morpho-physiological traits (body size and basal metabolic rate) among M. glareolus populations, and found
differences between females from populations with different mtDNA types, although the effect of geography
could not be excluded. The underpinnings and consequences of this variation are discussed.

enlarged map of Finland refer to the localizations of trapped
populations: 1 - Tammela (SW), 2 - Virolahti (SE), 3 - Kannus (CW), 4
- Sotkamo (CE), 5 - Kolari (NW) and 6 - Savukoski (NE). Species
distributions after: Amori et al. 2009 and Linzey et al. 2009.

In total, 201 voles trapped during summer 2008 in 6
localities in Finland (Figure 1) were analyzed for variation in mitochondrial and nuclear markers (Additional
file 1: Table S1, Additional file 2: Table S2, Additional
file 3: Table S3, Additional file 4: Table S4 and Additional File 5; Accession numbers: [GenBank: JF929975JF930131]). After allelic phase determination (number of
removed haplotypes per gene, with a lower probability
of 0.95, for LCAT, G6pd, BRCA1 and GHR were 1, 0, 0
and 5, respectively) the number of alleles present in M.
glareolus nuclear genes varied between 7 and 10 (Table
1). The phylogenies reconstructed for each of the
nuclear genes were consistent across methods and coincided with the expected assignment of individuals to the
species (Figure 2), since both M. glareolus and M. rutilus (see geographic distribution in Figure 1) were recovered as monophyletic with high statistical support
(Figure 2). The cyt b sequences obtained were most
likely of mitochondrial origin and not of nuclear integrated copies, as the reading frame was unbroken (no
stop codons were found) and the composition of the
third codon position was typical (A 40.5%, C 39.4%, G
2.2% and T 17.8%) compared to the average in mammals (A 39%, C 36%, G 3% and T 21%; [35]).

grouped 57 (65 when including Swedish and specimens
sampled 2009) individuals of M. glareolus together with
M. rutilus specimens, suggesting mtDNA introgression.
The second clade, M. glareolus-type mtDNA (GLA),
only grouped haplotypes specific for M. glareolus (Figure
3). The geographic distribution of each of these haplogroups was partly disjoint, with Southern and Central
Finland (1-4 on Figure 1) being occupied by the GLA
type mtDNA, whereas the North and Central-East (4-6)
populations had the RUT type. One population located
in Central-Eastern Finland exhibited both mitotypes
(population 4: Figure 1).
Nuclear DNA sequence variation within M. glareolus
was also detected (Table 1). The frequency spectrum of
mutations did not significantly differ from the neutral
mutation-drift expectations for most genes, as determined by Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs (Table 1). For cyt b,
sequence diversity of individuals with the GLA and RUT
mitotype was comparable and high (Table 2). GLA and
RUT type cyt b sequences differed by 0.098 (0.014) and
0.102 (0.014) substitutions per site, respectively, from M.
rufocanus sequences, while the divergence between GLA
and RUT mitotypes was 0.070 (0.011) (net between
group average distances and its standard errors calculated by bootstrapping 1000 times). The mismatch analysis of cyt b sequences from M. glareolus showed a
bimodal distribution of the number of pairwise differences (Figure 4a), which illustrates the existence of two
divergent lineages. Similar results were obtained for the
population from East-Central Finland (population 4,
Sotkamo; Additional file 6: Figure S1d), where the
mtDNA lineages coexist. The mismatch distributions
analyzed separately for each of the mtDNA type (Figures
4b and 4c) and population were unimodal (Additional
file 6: Figure S1). The goodness of fit test for deviation
from the expectation under the Sudden Expansion
Model rejected the model for the data set including all
bank voles with their own mtDNA (Figure 3b; p =
0.019). All significant Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs values were
negative (Table 2). Both the unimodality of the cyt b
mismatch distribution within clades/populations and
negative and significant values of tests of selective neutrality are expected for populations undergoing recent
demographic growth or/and under positive selection.

Given the average rate of cytochrome b divergence for
rodents [36] of 0.176% per site per Myr and the parameters derived from the mismatch distribution (τ = 3.5;
CI = 1.9-4.7) for the introgressed haplogroup, this translates to an expansion time of approximately10 500 (5
500-14 000) years ago. The unimodal distribution and
star-like network may imply that introgression of
mtDNA happened only once into the Finnish populations of bank voles (Figure 3). Despite the excess of rare
alleles that were generally detected in M. glareolus in
the cyt b and not in the nuclear genes, the multilocus
HKA test [37] did not reject the null neutral model of
evolution (p > 0.05).

latitude and their interaction did not affect variation in
females’ body mass and were sequentially excluded
from the model (p > 0.1). Within the sympatric population of two mitotypes (Figure 1; population 4), 8
females and 8 males of M. glareolus were detected
with M. rutilus mtDNA (Table 4). The introgressed
females had significantly lower values of whole-body
BMR than sympatric females with native mtDNA (p =
0.049, Figure 5a). Mass corrected BMR showed the
same trend but was not significant (p = 0.262). These
effects were also similar for males and in the same
direction, but were also insignificant. No significant
differences between sympatric mitotypes in body mass
were detected in this population (Table 4; Figure 4b).

Phenotypic variation

All traits measured were positively correlated (N =
191, r = 0.66, 0.57 and 0.43 for BMR-BM, HW-BM
and BMR-HW; p < 0.001) and all repeatability estimates (coefficients of intraclass correlation) were high
and statistically significant (τ > 0.62, p < 0.0003, Table
3). As body mass and BMR were significantly influenced by a latitude-sex interaction in the initial analyses of variance (logBM: F = 3.13, p = 0.046, logBMR:
F = 3.41, p = 0.035, Additional file 7: Figure S2),
further tests were performed separately within sexes.
Whole body BMR was higher in the GLA than in the
RUT mitotype in M. glareolus females (p = 0.032;
Table 4, Figure 5a). For males, whole body and masscorrected BMR decreased toward the North (p = 0.002
and 0.015) but did not differ between mitotypes (the
effect was generated mainly by Southern populations,
which had the highest values of BMR, Additional file
7: Figure S2). Female M. glareolus with the GLA mitotype were significantly heavier than females with the
RUT mitotype (p = 0.004, Figure 5b). Longitude,

Discussion
Although mitochondria serve important physiological
functions in organisms, its evolution has traditionally
been considered neutral. Accordingly, mtDNA variation
should have little phenotypic consequences in natural
populations [26]. However, during the last decade evidence is accumulating that the evolution of mtDNA is
often subject to natural selection [38,39]. Over 20 years
ago, mtDNA flow between two species of Myodes voles,
the bank vole, Myodes glareolus, and the red vole, M.
rutilus, was first described [27], providing a potentially
good model to test whether naturally occurring mtDNA
introgression may influence phenotypic traits. Here, in
addition to sampling some M. rutilus specimens, we
sampled M. glareolus in 6 Finnish populations, including
the northern range of the species where it overlaps with
M. rutilus, where mtDNA introgression might occur.
We assessed mtDNA introgression by comparing the
mtDNA-based phylogeny with that of 4 nuclear DNA
markers. As expected, we detected congruence between

species assignment of the individual voles with the variation in four nuclear markers (Figure 2), and found that
most of the mtDNA haplotypes sampled in M. glareolus
from northern Finland (Figure 1) cluster within the
clade of M. rutilus (Figure 3), which is a typical consequence of mtDNA introgression [18-21,23]. Indeed, it is
striking to note that the mtDNA haplotypes from M.
rutilus are fixed in the northern populations of M. glareolus and only in one population did we find both the
native and the introgressed mitotypes (Figure 1).

Having identified among the sampled specimens those
with native and introgressed mtDNA, we aimed to test
whether introgression explains differences in two key
phenotypic measures: body size and basal metabolic
rate. These traits were studied because size and energetic physiology are important predictors for life history
traits in animals [8,12,40]. Also, some of the most recent
data and theoretical predictions link variation in those
traits with different fitness components [1,2,6]. We
found that the repeatability of size and metabolism was
significant (Table 3) and that phenotypes varied markedly between distantly located populations of bank
voles. It has been postulated that the geographic variation in morpho-physiological traits might be caused by
climatic differences among distant localities [10,41]. If
so, the phenotypic differences are predicted to be
noticeable and caused by phenotypic plasticity or adaptation to different habitats along environmental gradients, which here could include information inherited in
mtDNA as a possible mechanism of physiological adaptation [42].

An interesting observation from our results is that the
northern (and introgressed) Myodes glareolus voles were
smaller and had lower BMR values than voles from the
southern populations (and with the native mitotype,
Additional file 7: Figure S2). Sex specific tests showed
that females with different mtDNA types differed in
body mass and absolute (whole-body) metabolic rate but
not in mass-corrected BMR, whereas males from northern populations had lower values of absolute and masscorrected BMR, but not body mass, and their traits did
not vary significantly between mtDNA types (Table 4).
Whether the inferred differences across populations are
due to mtDNA introgression or related to genome reticulation is difficult to assess because bank voles from
northern populations are also exclusively introgressed.
To circumvent this problem we analyzed a subsample of
the data from the single population where both mitotypes coexist, thus eliminating the geographic factor.
Although we did not find a significant difference in
body size between introgressed and non-introgressed
voles (Figure 5b), we found that introgressed females
had lower absolute BMR values than non-introgressed
ones (Table 4, Figure 5a). However, this association was
not significant when BMR was mass-corrected. Though,
only 8 females with M. rutilus mtDNA type were
sampled in this population, which yields little power to
detect effects on body size and mass corrected BMR.
The absence of a strong relationship between mtDNA
type and variation in phenotypic characters could have
resulted from relatively recent divergence between vole
species, and consequently, the functional similarity
between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, as shown in

recent experimental transitions of whole genomes in
Drosophila species [43]. Otherwise, the co-introgression
of some nuclear genes that have not been included in
current analyses, but may be important for energetic
physiology and body growth rate, may have balanced
the incompatibility and influenced particular phenotypes
[44,45]. The observed sex-specific effects of mtDNA on
phenotypes, visible at least in the between-population
analyses carried out here and in another study [46],
could be explained by different requirements between
sexes connected to their reproductive biology [8,47]. In
fact, recent models predict e.g. that the level of the rate
of basal metabolism in endotherms is a consequence of
directional selection operating on reproductive performance [48,49]. Accordingly, such processes are related
to two energetically-costly female reproductive processes: pregnancy and lactation. It has been also experimentally confirmed that directional selection can
perform differentially on size and metabolic rate
between sexes in mammals [1,2]. However, the most
important prediction for differential effects of mtDNA
on phenotype comes from the fact that in mammals,
mitochondria are almost exclusively transmitted through
females. Consequently, mtDNA can only have direct
adaptive effect for females and the mtDNA effects on
male phenotype are expected to result from counterbalancing effects of nuclear genes [50].
The prevalence of the introgressed mtDNA haplotype
in the northern populations of M. glareolus in extreme
frequencies - the foreign haplotype seems fixed in these
populations - is striking, and we thus raised the hypothesis that mtDNA introgression could have been

Variation in body mass (BM, g), head width (HW, mm) and basal metabolic rate (BMR, ml O2 min-1) is presented for bank voles from “all populations” and from
Sotkamo “Sympatric population” where mitotypes coexist. Significance of the effects: type of the mtDNA (rutilus vs. glareolus), latitude (lat.) and longitude
(insignificant and excluded from table) of population (6 populations) were tested in ANOVA or ANCOVA (for BMR with BM as covariate) models on log
transformed traits as dependent variables. Marginal means (and their SDs) for mtDNA types for ANCOVA models were calculated accounting for variation in BM.

promoted by natural selection. We assessed if the frequency spectrum of mutations of the introgressed haplotypes could be biased towards an excess of rare alleles,
a pattern compatible with post-introgression positive
selection. Our analysis of sequence variation among the
introgressed cyt b haplotypes indeed shows a pattern
that is not compatible with a model of population equilibrium (bell-shaped mismatch distribution and negative
and significant Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs values; Table 2).
This could result from adaptive introgression of
mtDNA, promoting the expansion of the novel haplotype northward. However, selection is expected to affect
solely the locus in question, while the effect of population expansion and other demographic phenomena
should affect the whole genome equally, on average. As
the HKA test did not indicate any deviation from neutral expectations of the multilocus ratios of divergence
to polymorphism (see Results) and both mitotypes identified in M. glareolus (GLA, and the introgressed RUT)
showed similar expansion signals, our results suggest
that the species itself may have undergone recent population expansion, spreading the traces of mtDNA introgression throughout the northern range of M. glareolus.
Indeed, if hybridization occurs between a resident and
an invading species, introgression is expected to occur
into the spatially expanding one, in a stochastically neutral phenomenon [51,52]. This scenario has been used
to explain massive mtDNA introgression among hares
[53,54] and (potentially) in other organisms [55]. In this
demographic replacement process, markers with lower
intraspecific migration rates, as is often the case with
mtDNA, are expected to introgress more easily because
the influx of native alleles into the invasion front is
lower [51,52]. Thus, the northern expansion of M. glareolus into the range of M. rutilus could have favoured

Page 7 of 12

mtDNA introgression in a purely neutral manner, and
could also explain the asymmetry of the observed introgression. Such asymmetry could be explained by femalebiased assortative mating [56]. In a situation of interspecific contact with imbalanced frequencies of the interacting species, the females of the rare species (in this
case, presumably the out-competed M. rutilus) tend to
mate more easily with the heterospecific males, i.e., the
expanding M. glareolus. The continuous backcrossing of
hybrids with the same frequency-dependence over generations would cause introgression of the maternally
transmitted mtDNA in the direction of the more abundant species (M. glareolus). This asymmetry could also
occur if the invasion of the range of M. rutilus by M.
glareolus was pioneered by males, which are known to
disperse farther than females in this species [57].

Conclusion
This study uncovered marked differences in body mass
and BMR across Finnish populations of M. glareolus
along a north-south axis. These differences correspond
with massive mtDNA introgression from M. rutilus into
the populations of M. glareolus, which suggests that
genome reticulation may presumably be related to the
differences in phenotype. Given its role in energy processing, mtDNA is an obvious candidate to underlie
physiological phenotypic differences more directly.
Although a signal of association between mtDNA introgression and whole-body BMR was detected from the
analysis of the population where the native and foreign
mtDNA haplotypes coexist, the results failed to show a
relationship between mass-corrected BMR or body mass
alone and the mitochondrial DNA. Further analyses
using increased sample sizes and more populations
where mtDNA types exist in sympatry will help to clarify this result. Also, the co-introgression of nuclear elements may be responsible for the altered phenotype and
counterbalance eventual incompatibilities between
nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Obvious candidates
for co-introgression with mtDNA are nuclear genes
involved in physiological pathways, most notably those
involved in mitochondrial function, which are known to
co-evolve with mtDNA [16]. The construction of congenic strains in breeding experiments [58,59], where the
mtDNA form M. rutilus is fixed in a nuclear background of M. glareolus, would allow testing if mtDNA
alone alters phenotype, and ultimately, whether the
mtDNA introgression has any significant fitness effects.
Methods
Sampling

Voles were trapped in six populations along NorthSouth and East-West gradients in Finland, near the
towns of Tammela (SW Finland: 60°48’N:23°58’E),

Boratyński et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:355
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/355

Virolahti (SE: 60°35’N:27°34’E), Kannus (CW: 63°
50’N:23°55’E), Sotkamo (CE: 64°07’N:28°23’E), Kolari
(NW: 67°19’N:23°46’E) and Savukoski (NE: 67°17’N:28°
09’E; Figure 1) in July and early of August 2008. Trappings were repeated during August 2009 in Sotkamo,
where two mitotypes coexist in sympatry. Voles were
trapped using 200 to 300 live traps in each population
(Ugglan Special multiple-capture, Grahnab, Hillerstorp,
Sweden). Several trap lines (≥ 9) were distantly distributed from each other (> 2 km) to lower the chance of
trapping close relatives. Captured voles were assigned to
species and individually marked with transponders (ID100, Trovan). These species are easily distinguishable
since M. rutilus has a bright red back, which is much
darker in M. glareolus, and the relative tail to body
length differs greatly between the species [0.50 in M.
glareolus and 0.25 in M. rutilus; [60]]. After capture (>
30 specimens per population) the voles were transported
to the laboratory where they were housed in individual
cages with wood shavings and hay as bedding, in a
16L:8D photoperiod and 20 ± 2°C with standard food
(Labfor 36, Lactamin AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and
water available ad libitum. The use of the animals
adhered to ethical guidelines for animal research in Finland (permission numbers: ESLH-2008-04660/Ym-23
and ESLH-2009-09663/Ym-23) as well as all the institutional guidelines.
Molecular laboratory procedures

Genetic polymorphism in the mitochondrial cytochrome
b (cyt b) and 4 nuclear genes (LCAT - lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase exons 2 through 5, G6pd - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase partial intron, BRCA1
- Breast cancer 1 gene partial exon 11, GHR - growth
hormone receptor partial exon 10) were analyzed for
264 voles trapped in 6 localities (including 53 voles
trapped in 2009, Figure 1) in Finland and in one locality
in Sweden (10 individuals). Additional reference
sequences from these genes for Apodemus, Microtus and
Myodes species were included [GenBank: GQ267517,
AB086024, AY295009, AM910792, AY167187 and
AB303226]. Total genomic DNA was extracted from
ethanol preserved pieces of ear (2-3 mm2) collected during field expeditions using a Qiagen extraction protocol.
Purification was conducted in a KingFisher apparatus.
The cyt b gene was amplified using primers specific to
the bank vole (Additional file 1: Table S1) [33]. PCR
reactions for cyt b were performed in 30 μl volume
mixes containing 3 μl of DNA, 0.24 μl of Taq polymerase, 1.8 μl of F and R primers (5 μM), 1.2 μl of MgCl2
(2 mM), 3 μl of dNTP, 3 μl of reaction buffer and 15.96
μl of H2O. Reactions for nuclear genes were performed
on individuals trapped in 2008 in Finland as described
above with following modifications including usage of

Page 8 of 12

1X PCR buffer (BioTools), 200 μM of dNTPs, 0.5 U of
Taq polymerase and optimum MgCl2 concentrations
and specific primers (Additional file 1: Table S1). PCR
reactions were performed using the following protocol:
3 min of preliminary activation of Taq polymerase at
95°C were followed by 32 (34 for nuclear genes) threestep cycles of denaturation at 94°C (30 sec), annealing
temperature specific for primer (30 sec; see Additional
file 1: Table S1) and extension at 72°C (70 sec), and a
final extension at 72°C (10 min).
PCR products were purified by the Exo - SAP assay
(Amersham Biosciences). Sequence analysis was performed with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions
were performed using the PCR primers (Additional file
1: Table S1) in 16 μl mixes containing 1 μl of primer
(3.3 μM) and 3 μl of PCR product according to ABI
sequencing protocol. Sequencing was conducted in two
directions using a BigDye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. Both forward and reverse strands were merged
using the SeqScape v 2.1.1 and aligned using ClustalX v
2.0.10 softwares.
Sequence analyses

Initially, the allelic phase determinations for each of the
nuclear gene were obtained with PHASE v2.1.1 [61]. In
the subsequent phylogenetic analyses, only alleles with
phase calls with posterior probabilities over 0.95 were
used. DnaSP v 5.10.01 [62] and ARLEQUIN 3.11 [63]
were used to detect the number of haplotypes and number of variable sites within each gene and species. Phylogenetic relationships among sequences were
reconstructed using three different methods. First, using
the Neighbour Joining method, phylogenies were
inferred from a distance matrix obtained with the JukesCantor nucleotide substitution model and the robustness of the trees were assessed by bootstrap resampling
(BS: 1000 random replications) in MEGA 4 software
[64]. Based on the reconstructed initial trees a hierarchical likelihood ratio test and AIC based model selection
were then conducted in ModelTest v 3.0 [65], as implemented in HyPhy package [66] which determined the
simplest model of sequence evolution that best fits variation in data. The chosen models were further included
in the phylogenetic reconstructions. The robustness of
Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic analyses (ML) [67]
was assessed by bootstrap resampling (1000 random
replications) performed in the software PHYML v 2.4.4
[68]. The Bayesian inference (BI) approach was applied
to reconstruct the phylogenies using the program
MrBayes v 3.1.2 [69]. Four Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulations were started from the tree with
random topology and branch lengths. Simulations were

Boratyński et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:355
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/355

run for 10 million (1 million for nuclear markers) generations with trees sampled every 100 generations (100
000 trees saved) with the first 7 000 (700 for nuclear
markers) trees discarded from further analyses (burn-in).
The remaining trees were used to construct the consensus tree and estimate posterior probabilities for all
nodes in the BI tree using the 50% majority rule.
The relationships among cyt b haplotypes were additionally analyzed and visualized with the statistical parsimony method implemented in TCS 1.21 [70]. These
analyses were run together and separately for two types
of mtDNA, bank vole - GLA and red vole - RUT (the
latter group included haplotypes found both on bank
voles and red vole specimens). We also estimated
nucleotide diversity (π), θs computed from number of
segregating sites, haplotype diversity (h) and mismatch
distributions (ARLEQUIN 3.11) [63]. The mismatch distributions were calculated [71] and the goodness-of-fit
tests of the observed to the expected distributions
according to the Sudden Expansion Model were tested
[72]. The Sudden Expansion Model assumes that initial
population at equilibrium (of size: θ0) grew rapidly to a
new size (θ1), mutational times ago: τ = 2ut (u - mutation rate, t - time since the expansion in generation).
The confidence intervals for τ were calculated with 1000
bootstrap replicates for the alpha level of 0.010. The
assumption of selective neutrality and population equilibrium were tested with Tajima’s D [73] and Fu’s Fs [74]
statistics with 5000 simulated samples.
Multilocus ratios of polymorphism in M. glareolus to
divergence between this species and M. rufocanus were
contrasted with the expectations of a neutral model
using a Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade (HKA) test [37] as
implemented in the HKA program (http://lifesci.rutgers.
edu/~heylab/).
Metabolic measurements

After two months of acclimatization to laboratory conditions, measurements of oxygen consumption (ml h-1)
were conducted in an eight-channel open-flow respirometric system (Sable Systems, Henderson, NV) based
on the Fc-1B O2 (Sable Systems) analyzer. The system
was adapted to measure 7 animals (with the eighth
channel as a reference) per day. Prior to measurements,
animals were weighed and placed in Plexiglas chambers
(180 ml) without water or food at 30.0 ± 0.5°C, which is
within the species thermal neutral zone. The chambers
were connected to a system of dry air flow (after passing through a column with silica gel) of approximately
260 ml min-1 (accurate flows were measured with FlowBar, Sable Systems, Henderson, NV, and included in
metabolic rate calculations). Oxygen consumption was
recorded for a period of 7 h 30 min (from 09:00 to

Page 9 of 12

16:30). The samples of dried air (passed through Drierite desiccant) were taken sequentially from the seven
occupied measurement chambers and the reference
chamber every 15 min (with flow rate: 150 ml min-1).
In each cycle, each measurement chamber was active
for at least 110 seconds (first and reference chambers
were active 10 sec longer each) during which O2 values
were sampled every 1 sec. From each chamber, measurements taken during the last 20 seconds were used
for the calculation of average oxygen consumption.
Oxygen consumption (metabolic rate) was calculated
using O2 measures according to the formula VO2 = {Vi
(FdO 2 )/[1 - FeO 2 (1 - RQ)]}, [equation 1b from [75]]
where VO 2 is the oxygen consumption rate, Vi is the
flow rate measured before measurement chamber, FdO2
is the difference of O2 fractional concentrations in dry
air flow before and after passing through the measurement chamber, and FeO2 is the fractional concentration
of O 2 in dry air flow after passing the measurement
chamber. A respiratory quotient (RQ = CO2 eliminated/
O 2 consumed) of 0.75 for nearly starved animals was
assumed in the equation [75]. A total of 29 oxygen consumption values were calculated for each animal
throughout one measurement trial: every 15 minutes
over the 7 h 30 min period. Since the lowest of such
values may be subject to high error rates, mainly due to
the different physiological status of animals prior to the
measurement, we defined BMR as a mean of the third,
fourth and fifth lowest values, which proved to be quite
accurate [76],.
Statistical analyses

To normalize the data (BMR was right skewed: K-S test,
p = 0.005), body mass, head width and basal metabolic
rate measurements were log transformed prior to analyses. Pearson partial correlations between measured
characters included sex, population of origin and
mtDNA type as cofactors. Repeatabilities (τ) of traits
were estimated on two consecutive measurements (collected between 16 to 51 days; mean = 35.5 days) as
intraclass correlation coefficients, derived either from
simple analyses of variance or analyses of covariance
with body mass as a continuous predictor [77]. Geographic variation in body mass (BM, g), head width
(HW, mm) and basal metabolic rate (BMR, ml O2 h-1)
were tested with general linear models. In the models,
log transformed traits (BM, HW and BMR) were
included as dependent variables, while sex, type of
mtDNA (rutilus vs. glareolus), longitude (2 levels) and
latitude (3 levels) of populations were included as fixed
independent factors. Analyses were also conducted on
residual values of BMR, derived from linear regression
of log BMR on log BM.
