Abstract
Background: Accurate determination of orthology is central to comparative genomics. For
vertebrates in particular, very large gene families, high rates of gene duplication and loss, multiple
mechanisms of gene duplication, and high rates of retrotransposition all combine to make inference
of orthology between genes difficult. Many methods have been developed to identify orthologous
genes, mostly based upon analysis of the inferred protein sequence of the genes. More recently,
methods have been proposed that use genomic context in addition to protein sequence to improve
orthology assignment in vertebrates. Such methods have been most successfully implemented in
fungal genomes and have long been used in prokaryotic genomes, where gene order is far less
variable than in vertebrates. However, to our knowledge, no explicit comparison of synteny and
sequence based definitions of orthology has been reported in vertebrates, or, more specifically, in
mammals.
Results: We test a simple method for the measurement and utilization of gene order (local
synteny) in the identification of mammalian orthologs by investigating the agreement between
coding sequence based orthology (Inparanoid) and local synteny based orthology. In the 5
mammalian genomes studied, 93% of the sampled inter-species pairs were found to be concordant
between the two orthology methods, illustrating that local synteny is a robust substitute to coding
sequence for identifying orthologs. However, 7% of pairs were found to be discordant between
local synteny and Inparanoid. These cases of discordance result from evolutionary events including
retrotransposition and genome rearrangements.
Conclusions: By analyzing cases of discordance between local synteny and Inparanoid we show
that local synteny can distinguish between true orthologs and recent retrogenes, can resolve
ambiguous many-to-many orthology relationships into one-to-one ortholog pairs, and might be
used to identify cases of non-orthologous gene displacement by retroduplicated paralogs.

Background
The accurate determination of orthology is central to comparative genomics. Pinpointing the origin of new genes,
understanding the evolution of new gene families, and
assessing the impact of gene and genome duplication

events all require the accurate assignment of orthology
between genes in distinct genomes. In complex genomes
with large gene families this task requires differentiating
between genes that have diverged through a speciation
event (orthologs) and those derived through duplication

events within a species (paralogs). Determination of
orthology and paralogy is especially challenging in vertebrates species such as the mammals. Very large gene families, high rates of gene duplication and loss, multiple
mechanisms of gene duplication, and high rates of retrotransposition all combine to make the determination of
orthology between vertebrate genes difficult.
Given the importance of accurate orthology assignment,
many methods have been developed to identify orthologous genes. Most of these methods rely upon analysis of
the inferred protein sequence of the genes in question by
clustering the results of protein sequence comparisons
results in the classification of putative orthologs. Examples of this approach include reciprocal best BLAST hits
and more inclusive BLAST based clustering methods.
Splitting of these clusters based on relative similarity can
distinguish between older and newer duplication events
and is implemented in the widely used Inparanoid algorithm [1] and related approaches [2]. While these methods are robust and easily implemented, they rely upon a
single character, the protein sequence, for classifying
genes into orthologous groups.
More recently, methods have been proposed that use
genomic context in addition to protein sequence to
improve orthology assignment. These methods have been
most successfully implemented in fungal genomes [3,4],
and have long been used in prokaryotic genomes [5,6],
where gene order is far less variable than in eukaryotes. An
interesting implementation of this approach is found in
the SOAR and MSOAR algorithms [7,8], which seek to
assign orthology by minimizing the recombination distance between two genomes. In most of these approaches,
synteny blocks covering some percentage of the genome
are used hierarchically with protein coding information to
assign orthology between similar genes. Approaches that
exploit synteny information can be particularly useful in
resolving ambiguous sequence based matches between
putative orthologs. Recently, Han and Hahn [9] used local
synteny information to identify parent-daughter relationships among duplicated genes. However, it is worth noting that "phylogenetic shadowing" [10] approaches used
in genome assembly might lead to a lack of independence
between sequence and synteny information.
In this study, we evaluate a simple method for using gene
order (local synteny) in the identification of mammalian
orthologs. We explicitly compare the relative performance
of local synteny and Inparanoid for inferring orthology
within this clade and show that local synteny alone is sufficient to identify orthologs with an accuracy comparable
to that of Inparanoid. By analyzing cases of discordance
between local synteny and Inparanoid we show that local
synteny can distinguish between true orthologs and recent

retrogenes, can resolve ambiguous many-to-many orthology relationships into one-to-one ortholog pairs, and can
highlight possible cases of parental gene displacement by
retrogenes.

Results
Using Local Synteny to Infer Orthology
Several orthology inference methods, such as Inparanoid
[1] and OrthoMCL [2], use coding sequence similarity
(for example Blastp score [11] or Protdist [12]) as primary
orthology signal. In this paper, we use local synteny information to determine orthology. We define the local synteny of two genes as the maximum number of unique
homologous matches between their six neighboring genes
(three upstream and three downstream immediate neighbors for each gene, see Figure 1). Homology between two
neighboring genes is defined as Blastp E-value < 1e-5.

To validate the use of local synteny for inferring orthology, we evaluated the correlation between Protdist and
local synteny using a dataset derived from the Pfam protein family database. Pfam families are highly accurate
protein families based on protein domains [13]. We randomly selected 1,000 cross-species homologous protein
pairs (homologs belonging to a given Pfam family) from
five mammalian genomes: Homo sapiens (human), Pan
troglodytes (chimp), Mus musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), and Canis familiaris (dog). To avoid protein family-specific bias in this analysis, we chose one
homologous pair from each Pfam family. For each pair we
computed Protdist and the degree of local synteny
between the two genes. Figure 2a shows that there is negative correlation between Protdist and the local synteny of
these samples (r = -0.67 with p-value < 0.0001). This is
not surprising as gene order is conserved between DNA
segments resulting from speciation or large-scale segmental duplication events. However, because local synteny is
not directly computed based on the coding sequence, we
can use local synteny to test hypotheses of orthology
between two genes independent of their coding sequence.
Theoretically two non-orthologous genes should not
share homologous neighboring genes. However, there is a
small probability of homology matches occurring by
chance. Moreover rearrangements, insertions, and deletions will lead to loss of local synteny between orthologous genes. In order to account for these events, we
wanted to determine an optimal window size and match
percentage that could reliably identify orthologs based on
local synteny. In Figure 2b, we test the impact of the
number of matches between six neighboring genes to
determine local synteny. Student's t tests comparing Protdist means illustrate that 0, 1, and >1 matches have significantly different Protdist means (p-value ≤ 0.05). In order
to choose the threshold of homologous matches, we cal-

Diagram illustrating the computation of the maximum number of unique homologous matches. We counted the
homologous matches between 3 neighboring genes (shown as filled arrows with corresponding gene orientations) on each side
of the two genes of interest (GOI, shown as two black boxes). Homology between neighboring genes (shown as line between
genes) is defined as Blastp E-value < 1e-5. The homologous matches do not need to be between the genes with the same orientations (1) or on the same strand (2). Also they do not need to be co-linear (3). When there are many-to-many homologous
matches, we choose the maximum unique matches (4). The number of maximum unique homologous matches in this case is 5.

culate the false positive rate (FP) and false negative rate
(FN) to Inparanoid orthologs and Ensembl orthologs
then choose the threshold that minimizes the sum of FP
and FN events. For six neighbors, the pairs with more than
one homologous match minimizes FP and FN rates
(0.152 to Inparanoid orthologs, and 0.151 to Ensembl
orthologs (see Additional file 1)). Increasing the window
size to 10 or 20 flanking genes does not show a significant
difference in detecting orthology (see Additional file 1).
Based on these results we define orthology by local synteny when the number of maximum unique homologous
matches between the six neighboring genes is greater than
one. We will refer to those pairs as syntenic from now on.

False Positive/False Negative Rates Estimated by LCA
(Latent Class Analysis)
Since many orthology detection methods use more complicated algorithms than just coding sequence similarity,
a high correlation between Protdist and local synteny
(Figure 2) is not sufficient evidence that local synteny captures true orthology. For a more rigorous analysis we compared local synteny based orthology to the orthology
relationships inferred by six well-known orthology detection methods: Inparanoid [1], OrthoMCL [2], RBH
(Reciprocal Best Hit), SBH (Single-way or One-way Best
Hit), BLASTP, and orthology data from Ensembl [14].
Since there is no gold standard of orthology, we per-

formed Latent Class Analysis (LCA) [15,16] to estimate
the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) in the absence of
a reliable standard. LCA estimates false positive (FP) and
false negative rates (FN) based on agreement and disagreement between various ortholog definitions. To minimize sampling bias 10 LCA's were performed on random
samples with a size of 1,000 orthologous genes from five
mammalian genomes using the same sampling method
described in the previous section. For one sample 1,000
Pfam families were randomly selected, then one cross-species protein pair was selected from each Pfam family for
analysis by the seven compared orthology inference methods. For all methods based on coding sequence similarity,
the longest proteins were used as the representative proteins of the genes. A more detailed description can be
found in the methods section.
Figure 3 shows that orthology inference based on local
synteny yields a lower FP rate than SBH/BLASTP and a
lower FN rate than OrthoMCL, reinforcing the interpretation that orthology can be accurately inferred without
coding sequence information. However, local synteny has
a slightly higher FN rate than the four orthology methods
based on coding sequence similarity (BLASTP, SBH, RBH
and Inparanoid). This is partially due to the fact that these
coding sequence based methods cannot distinguish retrotransposed genes from the original copies unless retrotransposed genes are sufficiently diverse. This might lead
to incorrect orthology assignments (retrotransposed copies replace the original ortholog genes) or ambiguous
orthology assignments (one-to-many or many-to-many
ortholog groups including retrotransposed copies as their
members) by these methods. Local synteny also has a
slightly higher FP rate than Inparanoid and RBH. This is
likely due to the fact that local synteny cannot distinguish
DNA-mediated duplicates from the original copies. We
analyze these discordances in more detail in the following
section.
Discordance between Inparanoid Orthology and Local
Synteny Based Orthology
Because Inparanoid is one of the most widely used
ortholog definition methods [17-19] and is purely based
on the coding sequence information, we decided to do a
more thorough comparison of Inparanoid and local synteny based orthology. Figure 4 shows the agreement and
disagreement between these two orthology prediction
methods. The majority of these samples are concordant
between two ortholog predictions (syntenic/Inparanoid
(55.1%) and non-syntenic/non-Inparanoid (37.9%)),
which agree with the LCA results (Figure 3). However,
2.5% of Inparanoid orthologs are non-syntenic, and 4.5%
of gene pairs are syntenic but not Inparanoid orthologs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/630

In order to identify the source of this discordance we
employed intron-based evidence. Specifically, for each
gene pair used in the test we computed the intron conservation ratio (ICR) between the two genes defined as follows (for more details see Methods):

ICR =

#(positional homologous introns)
#(intron positions in protein alignment)

Figure 4 shows ICR histograms for pairs of genes falling in
each of the four classes of agreement/disagreement
between Inparanoid and local synteny. In both concordance cases, namely for syntenic Inparanoid orthologs (Figure 4a) and non-syntenic non-Inparanoid orthologs
(Figure 4d), ICR is in strong agreement with the orthology
assignments made by the two methods. Indeed, most of
the syntenic Inparanoid orthologs have ICR of 1 (Figure
4a), and the majority of non-syntenic non-Inparanoid
orthologs have ICR < 0.5 (Figure 4d). In the two discordant cases (7% of the evaluated gene pairs) intron evidence
can be used to resolve the conflicting assignments made
by Inparanoid and local synteny. About 3/4 of syntenic
non-Inparanoid orthologs (Figure 4b) have ICR > 0.5 and
half of non-syntenic Inparanoid orthologs (Figure 4c)
have ICR = 0. This suggests that in these cases local synteny based orthology assignments are more often concordant with gene structure evidence (ICR) than those
based on coding sequence similarity. However, the ICR
histogram of non-syntenic Inparanoid orthologs (Figure
4c) has a bimodal distribution, which might arise from a
mixture of FNs from local synteny (pairs with high ICR)
and FPs from Inparanoid (pairs with low ICR). We further
investigate these cases in the following subsections.
Non-syntenic Inparanoid orthologs with zero ICR:
Retrotransposed copies
All the non-syntenic Inparanoid ortholog pairs with zero
ICR contain one intronless copy and one intron-bearing
member. Based on local synteny information and intron
conservation ratio, these intronless copies are probably
retrotransposed (RT) copies of the original orthologs. Of
all the samples, 1.2% are non-syntenic 0-ICR Inparanoid
orthologs. Inparanoid likely included RT copies in these
orthologous groups because the RT copies have not
diverged sufficiently to be distinguished from their parent
gene. In 0.2% of samples Inparanoid chose RT copies even
though there were other syntenic high-ICR copies. Figure
5 shows one of these pairs. In this case, the Blastp score of
the dog gene to the RT rat gene (shown as Rat A) is smaller
than to the syntenic high-ICR rat gene (Rat B), which
caused an Inparanoid miscall, assigning the RT paralog as
the ortholog. For the detailed information including
Blastp scores and Protdist in tabular format, see Additional file 2.

FN rates are estimated for each method by using LCA from
10 sampling replicates. Inset figure shows the FP and FN
rates of four orthology detection methods (Inparanoid, RBH,
Ensembl and local synteny based orthologs) having lowest FP
and FN rates. For details and each orthology detection
method, see Methods.

The rest of non-syntenic 0-ICR Inparanoid orthologs
(1.0%) of all samples are classified as one-to-many
orthologs by Inparanoid. In many of these one-to-many
orthologs, syntenic high-ICR pairs are chosen as "core
orthologs" (based on the Inparanoid scores) with additional RT copies added to the orthology group because
their protein sequences are still close to those of the original copies. By using local synteny, the RT copies in oneto-many orthologs would be distinguished from the other
members. Thus, local synteny based orthology separates
RT copies from those generated by speciation or other
duplication mechanisms and can be more informative in
recovering the evolutionary history of a gene family.
Non-syntenic Inparanoid orthologs with non-zero ICR:
Loss of local synteny
All non-syntenic Inparanoid orthologs with an ICR > 0
(1.3%) are likely to result from the loss of local synteny.
They each have one homologous match between neighboring genes (lower than the threshold of being syntenic)
and are selected from distant species pairs (i.e. not
human-chimp or mouse-rat). Each of these distant pairs is
part of larger orthology groups (5-species), in which the
counterparts in closer species pairs have higher local synteny (more than 1 match). This loss of local synteny likely
results from rearrangements and gene insertions or gene

losses in more distant species. See Additional file 3 for an
example.
Syntenic non-Inparanoid orthologs: Distant paralogs
There are 2.3% syntenic non-Inparanoid orthologs with
an ICR ≥ 0.5 (Figure 4b). The majority (2.1/2.3%) of syntenic non-Inparanoid orthologs with high ICR are likely
distant paralogs: both genes are in different syntenic
Inparanoid orthology groups with high ICR. This may
result from old DNA-mediated duplication events followed by speciation events without significant local
genome rearrangements. Local synteny cannot distinguish
between orthologs created by large-scale segmental duplications and by polyploidy events. Moreover, the syntenic
non-Inparanoid pairs with an ICR < 0.5 (1.1% of all tested
pairs) are also likely distant paralogs, by old tandem
duplications with different gene structures resulting in
lower ICR.
Non-syntenic non-Inparanoid orthologs with ICR of 1:
More distant paralogs
In the non-syntenic non-Inparanoid case (Figure 4d),
where the most of these pairs have low ICR, we still find
2.2% of pairs with ICR equal to 1. All these pairs are likely
distant paralogs. Table 1 contains the summary of all of
these cases.
Local Synteny Breaks the Tie
Since local synteny is able to differentiate some speciation
and duplication events, a phylogenetic tree (or duplication-speciation history) of ambiguous many-to-many
orthologs may be determined using local synteny information. In mouse-to-rat ortholog definitions from Inparanoid, there are 131 many-to-many ortholog groups. The
majority (~75%) of many-to-many groups are comprised
of DNA-mediated duplicated copies (usually from tandem duplications combined with one or two distant segmental duplication events) while ~20% have true
orthologs (confirmed by local synteny and ICR) as well as
non-syntenic intronless copies (probably from RT events).

We present two many-to-many Inparanoid ortholog
groups where the local synteny determines the order of
evolutionary events in the gene family. One of them is an
example of orthologs from distant DNA-mediated duplication event(s) followed by possible rearrangements or
gene gains/losses, and then speciation event (Figure 6). In
this ortholog group, there are three mouse gene members,

Intron based orthology
Intron conservation ratio (ICR) histograms in four concordant and discordant cases between Inparanoid
orthology and local synteny based orthology. 7.0% of disagreement between Inparanoid orthology and local synteny
based orthology and the majority (93%) of sample pairs are concordant between two orthology methods. Most of the pairs
concordant between local synteny and Inparanoid, (a) syntenic Inparanoid ortholog (denoted as LS(+)/Inp(+) ) and (d) non-syntenic non-Inparanoid pairs ( LS(-)/Inp(-) ), are also concordant with ICR: orthologs have a high ICR and non-orthologs have a
low ICR. However in discordant cases, (b) syntenic non-Inparanoid ( LS(+)/Inp(-) ) and (c) non-syntenic Inparanoid orthologs (
LS(-)/Inp(+) ), ICR histograms show a partial agreement with two orthology definitions. Also there are small numbers of nonsyntenic non-Inparanoid pairs ( LS(-)/Inp(-) ) having perfect ICR in panel (d).

tein coding) genes are known. Since all the cross-species
pairwise sequence similarity measures are equal, Inparanoid could not pick distinct orthologs nor could phylogenetic tree-building programs determine the tree (for
Blastp results see Additional file 4). Neither could ICR
break the tie due to a high conservation of gene structure.
Finally, no Ensembl ortholog prediction is made between
these genes. However, in the figure, two Calm1 genes
(ENSMUSG00000001175 and ENSRNOG00000004060)
and two Calm3 genes (ENSMUSG00000019370 and
ENSRNOG00000016770) have high local synteny (4 and
5 matches, respectively) and any other local synteny is
either 0 or 1. In this specific case, local synteny helps break
the tie in sequence based similarity. Using this information we can infer an old segmental duplication (SD) event
before mouse-rat speciation giving rise to the Calm1 and
Calm3 ancestors followed by rearrangements reducing the
local synteny between these two mouse and rat ortholog
pairs (Figure 6). The third mouse gene (Calm3x) has just
one match with mouse Calm1 gene and rat Calm1 gene,
and high levels of intron conservation, indicating a DNA

duplication event, but we do not have enough local synteny information to tell precisely when the duplication
occurred. Also since the mouse Calm3x gene has only one
match with the rat Calm1 gene, local synteny does not
find this apparent ortholog. For the detailed information
in tabular format, see Additional file 4.
Another case where local synteny clarifies the history of
closely related groups of duplicates can be seen in a
mouse-rat many-to-many Inparanoid ortholog group
including RT copies (Figure 7). This example contains two
members from each species, ENSMUSG00000013701
(MGI symbol: Timm23 referred as Mm1 in the figure),
ENSMUSG00000069622 (Timm23 as Mm2) and
ENSRNOG00000019811
(Timm23
as
Rn1),
ENSRNOG00000032900 (TIM23_RAT as Rn2), where
each has one known transcript on different chromosomes. Again, neither Inparanoid nor pairwise Protdist
analysis could discriminate orthologs due to identical
cross-species Blastp measures (for Blastp results see Additional file 5). Ensembl has a bigger ortholog group includ-

ing these four genes, but no better information about
which are orthologs or RT copies. However two intron
bearing genes have perfect local synteny (= 6) and an ICR
= 1, and two intronless copies do not have any local syntenic match to the two intron bearing genes. Therefore, we
can infer that two intron bearing genes are the main
orthologs and two intronless genes are RT copies of these
orthologs. Furthermore, since intronless genes are not
syntenic to each other, we infer that the two intronless
genes are the result of two separate RT events on each species lineage. For detailed information in tabular format,
see Additional file 5.

Discussion
FP and FN Estimates by Using LCA
The accurate determination of orthology is critically
important to comparative genomics. However it has been
a challenge to compare the various orthology determination methods without a reliable gold-standard orthology
dataset [15]. The statistical technique of Latent Class Analysis allows estimates of false positive and false negative
rates from data based on agreement and disagreement
between various ortholog definitions. Because error rates
estimated in this way may be affected by which methods
are included in the analysis, we must consider the FP and

from a genome-wide implementation of these methods.
There is an ongoing effort on standardizing protein datasets for benchmarking orthology determination methods
[20] which would help resolve this issue.

retaining flanking genes, but diverging in their coding
sequences enough to be distinguishable by Blastp. RT miscalls by Inparanoid (e.g. Figure 5) are also likely to have
contributed to the relative FN rate of local synteny based
orthology.

In Figure 3, Inparanoid and RBH agree more closely than
any other pair of orthology definitions. This is in accord
with the fact that Inparanoid uses the reciprocal best hit to
start core ortholog identification. SBH and BLASTP have
zero FN rates and higher FP rates than Inparanoid and RBH
due to less stringent conditions used for ortholog detection
in these methods. The order of FP rates (BLASTP > SBH >
RBH) is concordant with the stringency of each method.
The FP rate of local synteny based orthology falls between
SBH and RBH. This is reasonable considering the fact that
SBH and local synteny based orthology cannot distinguish
close paralogs from ortholog pairs, but local synteny can
separate RT close paralog copies from orthologs.

Due to the fact that OrthoMCL detected the smallest
number of orthologs in any sample (data not shown) the
estimated FN rates from OrthoMCL are the highest in this
experiment (approximately 0.3). This is opposite from the
result of Chen et al. [15] where OrthoMCL and Inparanoid
were shown to have lowest estimated FP and FN rates and
OrthoMCL has lower FN rates than Inparanoid. The apparent disparity between these results could be explained by
the fact that LCA is designed to estimate consensus FP and
FN rates without any guarantee that the estimated rates are
close to absolute values, and by the difference in the species
sets used in the two experiments: our dataset of five mammalian genomes and the comparatively distant seven
eukaryotic genomes used in Chen et al.

The FN rate of local synteny based orthology is higher
than those of Blastp based orthologies (Inparanoid, RBH,
SBH, and BLASTP). This may be due to distant paralogs

orthologous gene pairs [8,21] and to reconstruct phylogenetic trees [22]. These synteny blocks are generally used as
"genomic anchors" [11] or to place gene loss/deletion
events on phylogenetic trees [23,24], not as a definitive
measure to distinguish close paralogs from distant paralogs. In Zheng et al. [21], one of three methods to define
orthologs between human and mouse used a genomic
anchor approach. They identified synteny anchors and
synteny blocks [25,26] then introduced a local synteny
approach for the anchor-poor regions by accepting the
pairs of genes flanked by previously identified ortholog
pairs. With this approach they found 11% more orthologs
than by RBH alone.
Another similar approach to local synteny was used to
reconstruct phylogenetic gene trees from coding sequence
similarity and local gene order [22]. In the algorithm SYNERGY, Wapinski et al. measure a synteny similarity score
for a pair of genes by counting the neighboring genes in
syntenic blocks. However, SYNERGY has not been tested
in mammalian genomes.
Finally, MSOAR [8] uses combinatorial optimization on
global gene order to identify orthologs based on minimal
rearrangement scenarios. However, Fu et al. point out that

the global optimization might lead to false ortholog links
in some scenarios. Because our local synteny exploits
proximate synteny information we expect lower false positive ratios than those obtained with MSOAR.
Most importantly, when the orthology is defined by
codon sequence similarity, testing any hypothesis of selective pressures on orthologous gene presents tautological
challenges. Since orthology detection by local synteny is
not based on the comparison of coding sequence information between candidate orthologs, testing the selective
pressure between orthologs becomes a valid comparison
of largely independent variables. However, gene order
also degrades over evolutionary time. How well synteny
will be able to effectively identify ancient orthologs
remains to be seen.
Gene Duplication Mechanisms and Orthologs
Gene duplications are a major force in genome evolution
[27]. Genes are duplicated through two main duplication
mechanisms; DNA-mediated and RNA-mediated [27,28].
DNA-mediated duplications can include multiple genes
and associated intergenic sequences and introns. On the
other hand, RNA-mediated duplication, or retrotransposition (RT), only copies coding sequences in the duplicaPage 9 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:630

tion event. Retrotransposed genes had been considered
mostly "dead on arrival", but recent studies [29,30] show
that there are many functional RT copies in the human
and mouse genomes.
Sometimes the difference between coding sequences of
parental genes and RT copies is not large enough to distinguish the RT copy from the parent. RT copies, however, do
not share introns or flanking genes with the parental paralog. Therefore, local synteny and gene structure can often
separate the RT copy from the original gene. However,
when neither has an intron, only local synteny will distinguish parental and RT copies. Based on our random sampling, approximately 8~10% of Pfam orthologs are
intronless gene pairs.
Gene Order Helps Illuminate Gene Family Evolution
Reconstructing phylogenetic trees informs our understanding of the evolutionary history of gene families.
Using tree reconciliation between a species tree and gene
tree we can identify duplication and lost events on the
tree. However by distinguishing two duplication mechanisms, DNA-mediated and RNA-mediated, not just identifying duplication events, we can sometimes place
duplication events in an appropriate phylogenetic context. For example, as Figure 6 and Figure 7 show, when
coding sequence does not distinguish paralogs, local synteny can determine whether DNA or RNA-mediated
duplication occurred first. Local synteny can also help
place RT duplication events before or after speciation (Figure 7). Even when the coding sequence of RT duplicates
drifts apart, pre-speciation RT genes often retain local synteny. Conversely, when RT duplicates are young enough
to be indistinguishable by coding sequence comparison,
synteny can discriminate between pre-speciation duplications, and independent RT duplication events in parallel
lineages. Finally, local synteny information can often
resolve the order of iterative DNA-mediated duplication
events in large gene families (see also [9]).

Conclusions
In this paper, we investigate the concordance between
coding sequence based orthology (Inparanoid) and local
synteny based orthology. In the 5 mammalian genomes
studied, 93% of the sampled inter-species pairs were
found to be concordant between the two orthology methods, illustrating that local synteny can largely substitute
for coding sequence in identifying orthologs. However,
7% of pairs were found to be discordant. Discordance is
often associated with evolutionary events like retrotransposition, iterative DNA-mediated duplication, and
genome rearrangement. Analysis of discordant cases
between local synteny and Inparanoid shows that local
synteny can differentiate between true orthologs and
recent retrogenes, can split ambiguous many-to-many

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/630

orthology groups into more precise one-to-one ortholog
pairs, and, when employed in a genome-wide screen,
might help in highlighting possible cases of non-orthologous gene displacement by retrocopied paralogs in mammalian genomes.

Methods
Datasets for Ortholog Definitions
Five species analyzed (human, chimp, mouse, rat and
dog) were obtained from Ensembl release 48 [31]. We
only used protein coding genes in the Ensembl database.
For genes with multiple alternative transcripts we used the
longest transcripts as the representative ones. We used
Pfam families [13] to choose ortholog candidates. Since
there are more than hundreds of millions possible protein
pairs among five genomes in Pfam families, we sampled
our datasets in the following way. First, we randomly
selected 1,000 families from 3,418 Pfam families which
have at least two representative proteins from different
genomes. One cross-species protein pair was selected
from each Pfam family in order to avoid a bias from big
families. We used 10 sample datasets for the LCA experiment and one of them was used in the discordance analysis.
Local Synteny
Local synteny is measured by homology between the
neighboring genes of two genes of interest. In this study
the maximum unique homology matches between two
sets of six neighboring genes (three upstream and three
downstream neighbors) was used. The matches do not
need to be co-linear or between genes on the same strand/
orientation either (see Figure 1), which allows for genome
micro-rearrangements as well as gene losses and insertions in the flanking region. The homology between
neighboring genes is decided by pre-calculated Blastp [11]
results in the Ensembl Compara database [14]. To avoid
having high local synteny due to proximate tandem array
genes, we considered the tandem array genes as one
neighboring gene. Within a tandem array, each gene was
counted separately.
Orthology Definitions and LCA
We used five orthology detection methods and Ensembl
orthology in comparison with our local synteny based
orthology. For each of the five orthology detection methods -- namely Inparanoid [1], OrthoMCL [2], SBH (single
or one-way best hits), RBH (reciprocal best hits) and
BLASTP (one-way Blastp hits with the threshold) -- we
used the pre-computed Blastp outputs in Ensembl database as input data. Parameters and thresholds used for
each method are as follows:

1) BLASTP: homology detection using E-value cutoff
(= 1e-5)

Page 10 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:630

2) SBH: Single-way or One-way Best Hit. 'Best-hit' is
defined as the hit (or multiple hits tied) with the highest E-value (E-value cutoff = 1e-5)
3) RBH: Reciprocal Best Hit. 'Best-hit' is defined as
same as SBH (E-value cutoff = 1e-5)
4) Inparanoid (v2.0): bit score cutoff = 50 bits and
sequence overlap cutoff = 0.5
5) OrthoMCL (v1.4): E-value cutoff = 1e-5 and MCL
inflation index = 1.5; MCL package (v02-063) was
used.
The frequency table of agreements and disagreements
between orthology detection methods was calculated and
used for LCA. LCA was performed using the LEM package
[32] with default parameters to estimate the false positive
and false negative rates. We used a basic latent model to
produce Figure 3 assuming independence between various orthology detection methods. However, all methods
we considered are solely or partially based on protein
sequences. In order to account for these dependencies, we
applied another latent model with an extra latent variable.
With such a model, called latent class model with random
effects or a continuous factor (CFactor) model, the
responses of different tests are assumed to be independent
[15,33]. Although the estimated error rates from the CFactor model (Additional file 6) are less tightly distributed
than ones from the basic model, the relative values are not
changed significantly compared with Figure 3. The looser
distribution of values in the CFactor model is likely due to
a lack of convergence in these runs. For detailed description of two LCA models and the FP/FN graph by the CFactor model, see Additional file 6.
Intron Conservation Ratio (ICR)
Gene structure similarity is measured by the intron conservation ratio (ICR) between two intron-bearing genes
[34]. For genes with multiple alternative transcripts we
developed a collapsed gene model that incorporates all
potential exons of that gene. Resulting exon coordinates
were used to obtain the protein alignments and also to
align the positions of introns. ICR between two homologous genes was calculated as the ratio of the number of
positionally homologous introns divided by the total
number of intron positions from the protein/intron alignment, similar to the method in Rogozin et al. [34]. Introns
with less than 40BP were ignored in ICR calculation.
Case Analysis
For the discordant cases between Inparanoid, local synteny, and/or ICR based orthology (Panels b and c of Figure 4 and part of data in Figure 4d), we investigated:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/630

1) any significant Blastp hits other than the sampled
pairs (with ICR = 0 in Figure 4c or with ICR ≥ 0.5 in
Figure 4b) in order to find RT miscalls by Inparanoid
(e.g., Figure 5)
2) the other Inparanoid orthologs in all 5 species in
order to confirm rearrangement history in those families (with ICR > 0 in Figure 4c), and
3) Inparanoid orthologous counterparts of non-Inparanoid sampled pairs in Figure 4b and Figure 4d to confirm these sampled pairs from distant paralogs.
Mouse-rat many-to-many Inparanoid ortholog groups
were collected and analyzed to reconstruct their evolutionary history by considering the genomic location and
intron content of their member genes. Two example
ortholog groups (Figure 66 and Figure 7) were chosen due
to their unambiguous evolutionary history: for most
groups it is difficult to unambiguously reconstruct the full
evolution due to the presence of intermingled events.
