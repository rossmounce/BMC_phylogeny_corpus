Abstract
Background: Piroplasmosis in cattle is caused by tick-borne haemoprotozoan parasites of the
genera Theileria and Babesia. Molecular detection techniques offer higher sensitivity and specificity
than microscopy examination methods and serological tests. A reverse line blot (RLB) macroarray
that included generic and species-specific probes for Theileria annulata, Theileria buffeli, Babesia bovis,
Babesia bigemina, Babesia divergens and Babesia major was used to study the presence and identity
of the piroplasm species infecting 263 bovine blood samples from 79 farms, most of them in
Northern Spain. Microscopy examination of blood smears and haematology were also performed
whenever possible to identify animals with parasitaemia.
Results: RLB hybridisation identified infection in 54.0% of the samples, whereas only 28.8% were
positive by microscopy examination. The most frequently found species was T. buffeli, present in
42.6% of the samples. T. annulata was found in 22 samples (8.4%) from 12 farms, including 9 farms
(14 samples) located in Northern Spain where presence of the vector is not very common. Babesia
infections were less frequently detected: B. major was found in 3.0% of the samples, B. bigemina in
2.7%, B. bovis in 2.3% and B. divergens in 1.1%. Mixed infections were detected in 14 samples,
accounting for six different combinations of species.
Conclusion: This is the first report in which B. major and B. divergens have been detected in Spain
using molecular identification techniques and the first time that B. bovis has been detected in
Northern Spain. The detection of T. annulata in Northern Spain suggests that the distribution of
Mediterranean theileriosis might be changing. Samples with positive RLB hybridisation but negative
microscopy had haematology values within the normal ranges suggesting that they corresponded
to chronic carriers that may serve as reservoirs of the infection. In this sense, sensitive and specific
laboratorial tests like RLB that clearly identify the parasite and can detect subclinical infections are
essential to establish good control measures.

Background
Piroplasmosis in cattle is caused by tick-borne haemoprotozoan parasites comprising several Theileria and Babesia
species [1,2]. These diseases are of serious health and economic concern in several parts of the world, including
tropical and temperate countries. In Spain the main
malignant piroplasm species causing severe theileriosis
signs is Theileria annulata, with infections described in
Southern and Mediterranean areas [3-6], where the tick
vector (Hyalomma sp.) is present [7,8]. However, the most
widespread theileria is Theileria buffeli, which is in general
considered a benign species. Regarding Babesia spp., several pathogenic species have been reported in Central and
Southern Spain (B. major, B. bovis, B. divergens and B.
bigemina) [7], though only B. bigemina and B. bovis have
been detected in these areas in recent epidemiological
studies using molecular methods [3,9]. Different weather
conditions in different parts of Spain determine tick vector distribution, and therefore, the incidence of piroplasmosis. Unlike the dry and hot Mediterranean climate of
eastern and southern parts, Northern Spain covers two
different climatic zones: an Atlantic climate in the northern coast with frequent rainfall and mild temperatures,
and a Continental Mediterranean climate in the interior
central plateau with colder winters and warmer summers.
Hence, the main tick species infesting cattle in Northern
Spain are Ixodes ricinus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Dermacentor spp. and Rhipicephalus bursa [10,11]. Moving in a
southerly direction, ticks of the genus Hyalomma become
more prevalent, and similarly, other tick species such as I.
ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus become nearly absent
[7,8]. Therefore, a different situation regarding bovine
piroplasms diversity would be expected in this northern
area compared to other parts of Spain. However, there are
no studies on bovine piroplasmosis in Northern Spain
using molecular identification techniques.
Laboratorial diagnosis of clinical infection by piroplasms
in cattle is usually based on the detection of the parasite
in Giemsa-stained blood smears. Carrier animals, in
which low numbers of erythrocytes remain infected, are
important contributors to the transmission of the infection by tick bites. Hence, detection of piroplasms in carrier animals is very important to control the infection.
However, detection of piroplasms by microscopy is not
easy and it is generally not possible to discriminate pathogenic from non-pathogenic species that may occur
simultaneously within the same host. Although serological tests can be used to detect circulating antibodies, crossreactivity with antibodies directed against other species of
piroplasms has been reported [12]. Moreover, antibodies
tend to disappear in long-term carriers, whereas
piroplasms persist. Therefore, animals with a negative
serological test can still be the source of the infection and
infect ticks. Several PCR-based diagnosis procedures for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/16

the identification of these parasites have been developed
[13-16]. However, increased sensitivity and specificity can
be achieved by combining PCR with a specific hybridisation by means of reverse line blot (RLB), a macroarray that
is also capable of identifying mixed infections [9,17-20].
The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and
identity of piroplasm species infecting the bovine blood
samples with suspicion of piroplasmosis submitted to the
Diagnostic Service of our Institute from Northern Spain in
recent years using reverse line blot (RLB) macroarrays.

Results
Microscopy examination of blood samples identified
intracellular forms morphologically compatible with
piroplasms in 28.8% of them (Table 1), 82.5% corresponding to Theileria spp. and 17.5% to Babesia spp.
Piroplasms were detected by microscopy in 37.8 % of the
animals with clinical signs compatible with piroplasmosis
and in 24.6% of those with unspecific signs. In samples
with Babesia infection red cell parameters (erythrocyte
count 4.18 ± 1.19 × 106 mm-3, PCV 0.19 ± 0.039 l/l, and
haemoglobin 5.9 ± 1.54 g/dl) were significantly lower (P
< 0.05) than in those with Theileria spp. (erythrocyte
count 5.58 ± 0.50 × 106 mm-3, PCV 0.27 ± 0.023 l/l, and
haemoglobin 9.7 ± 0.79 g/dl) or negative (erythrocyte
count 5.85 ± 1.41 ×106 mm-3, PCV 0.30 ± 0.096 l/l, and
haemoglobin 10.4 ± 1.78 g/dl). Red cell parameters in
samples with Theileria spp. were lower than in negative
samples but differences were not significant. Samples with
mixed infections (Babesia spp. and Theileria spp.) presented intermediate values (erythrocyte count 5.01 ± 1.53
× 106 mm-3, PCV 0.25 ± 0.065 l/l, and haemoglobin 8.4 ±
2.11 g/dl) that were significantly lower than in negative
samples in terms of PCV. Leukocyte countings were also
significantly lower (4.46 ± 0.96 × 103 mm-3) in animals
with Babesia than in negative (7.18 ± 0.56 × 103 mm-3) or
Theileria-infected animals (7.38 ± 0.77 × 103 mm-3) (P <
0.05).
142 of the blood samples analysed hybridised with at
least one of the species-specific probes of the RLB array,
finding positive signals with all six probes (Fig. 1). Thus,
positive samples increased to 54.0% when analysed by
RLB (Table 1), with piroplasms being detected in 60.9%
of the animals with suspicion of piroplasmosis and in
50.0% of those with unspecific signs. T. buffeli was the
most frequently found species being present in 42.6% of
the samples (112/263), mainly as a single infection
(90.2%, 101/112) but also in mixed infections (9.8%, 11/
112). The highly pathogenic species T. annulata was second in detection with 8.4% of the samples positive (22/
263), in 15 of them as a single infection (68.2%) and as
part of mixed infections in the remaining 7 samples
(31.8%). T. annulata was found in 12 farms distributed

throughout Spain, including the 3 farms from the
endemic regions (2 from Southern Spain and 1 from the
Mediterranean area) that accounted for 8 animals with
single infection. The remaining 9 farms positive to T.
annulata were in Northern Spain and they appeared both
as single and mixed infections. In six of these farms only
1 or 2 animals were analysed, being all of them positive to
T. annulata (as a mixed infection in half of them). In the
other three farms the number of animals sampled varied
among 4 (1 animal positive to T. annulata), 5 (2 positive)

and 13 (3 positive), and other piroplasm species besides
T. annulata were also found in all three farms.
Presence of Babesia species was less frequently detected,
with 24 samples positive (9.1%) either as single or mixed
infection (Table 1). The species most frequently found
was B. major, present in 8 animals (3.0%) from 3 farms. In
five samples it was found as a single infection whereas in
the remaining 3 it appeared combined with T. buffeli. B.
bigemina was detected in 7 animals (2.7%) from 5 farms

and it always appeared as part of a mixed infection with
one or both species of Theileria. Conversely, B. bovis was
only found as a single infection present in 6 animals
(2.2%) from 3 farms from Northern Spain. Finally, B.
divergens was only found in 3 samples (1.1%) from 3
farms, in one animal it occurred as a single infection while
in the other two, B. divergens was detected along with T.
buffeli.
There was no significant difference in the percentage of
animals infected with T. annulata or T. buffelli between the
group of animals with clinical suspicion of piroplasmosis
and those with unspecific signs. However, detection of B.
major and B. bovis was significantly associated to the group
of animals with clinical suspicion of piroplasmosis (P <
0.05).
Mixed infections were detected in a total of 14 samples,
accounting for six different combinations of species
(Table 1). One of them included three species and the
remaining five were composed of a combination of two
species. Whereas T. buffeli and T. annulata were found
together in 4 samples (2 in combination with B.
bigemina), no mixed infections with two Babesia species
were detected. T. buffeli, the most prevalent species, was
found in combination with all the other species except
with B. bovis, which was only found in single infections.
When compared with microscopy, RLB detected a positive
signal in 40.0% of the samples with negative microscopy
(72 samples), identifying T. buffeli in 75.0% of them,T.
annulata in 15.3%, and several species of Babesia in
13.9%. However, 10 samples positive by microscopy were
not detected by RLB analysis. When looking only to the
RLB results of the animals with negative microscopy (subclinical infections), the lowest red cell parameters were
found in one animal infected with B. major (n = 1, erythrocyte count 3.02 × 106 mm-3, PCV 0.17 l/l, and haemoglobin 5.23 g/dl) and the animals infected with B. bovis (n
= 6, erythrocyte count 5.12 ± 1.04 × 106 mm-3, PCV 0.24
± 0.042 l/l, and haemoglobin 7.02 ± 1.95 g/dl), whereas

animals infected with species of Theileria had lower values
than negative animals but within the normal ranges.
Although the number of samples submitted from each
farm was in general quite small (more than one sample
was only submitted from 52% of the farms), 2 pathogenic
species (i.e. different to T. buffeli) were found in 5 farms,
located all of them in Northern Spain. T. annulata was
present in all five, along with B. bigemina in four of them
and with B. bovis in the fifth.

Discussion
The technique used in this study allowed the simultaneous detection and identification of different bovine Theileria and Babesia species using oligonucleotide probes
whose specificity has been previously determined
[9,17,19]. Moreover, the combination of a generic Babesia
and Theileria PCR targeting the V4 region of the 18S rRNA
gene and a hybridisation with specific probes provided
high sensitivity [9,19]. Since detection of the parasite in
Giemsa-stained blood smears is the technique that has
been traditionally used for diagnosis of piroplasmosis,
whenever possible RLB and microscopy examination were
performed in parallel. Besides, positive microscopy
allowed us to identify animals with parasitaemia. Thus,
RLB hybridisation detected piroplasms in 72 samples that
were negative by microscopy examination reaching a total
of 54.0% of positive samples, while only 28.8% could be
detected by microscopy. In any case, and even though RLB
was significantly more sensitive than microscopy,
piroplasms were detected by microscopy in 10 samples
negative by RLB. This discrepancy could be due to subjective interpretation of microscopy examination or bad conditions of the samples (e.g. haemolysis or presence of
clots). Whatever the reason, the inclusion of the catchall
and genus-specific probes guarantees that this discrepancy
cannot be ascribed to infection with new piroplasm species.
T. buffeli was the most prevalent species with 42.6% of the
samples positive by RLB. This value is much lower than

that reported in Eastern Spain using the same technology
[3], but higher than in Northeastern Portugal [21]. T. buffeli was mainly found as a single infection, but it was also
the most common species found in mixed infections.
Although Stockham and cols. [22] described a case of clinical disease associated to T. buffeli infection, this species is
generally considered as non-pathogenic. The results
obtained in this study would confirm this idea, since samples with organisms morphologically compatible with
Theileria spp. by microscopy examination and identified
as T. buffeli by RLB presented red cell parameters within
the normal ranges. However, this does not exclude the
possibility that subclinical infections with T. buffeli might
cause a production decrease. Further research is therefore
needed to establish the significance and effect on bovine
production of this highly prevalent species. Conversely, T.
annulata is clearly recognised as a very pathogenic theileria
that has been mainly described in temperate areas as the
causative agent of Mediterranean theileriosis. In Spain
most of the cases are generally restricted to southern and
eastern parts of the country, where the tick vector
(Hyalomma spp.) is endemic [4,7,8]. In this study T. annulata was found in 22 samples from 12 farms, 3 in the
endemic regions and 9 in Northern Spain. The lower incidence of T. annulata compared to T. buffeli (8.4% vs.
42.6%) is in agreement with the different geographic distribution of the tick vectors associated to each species.
Thus, whereas the vector of T. buffeli (Haemaphysalis spp.)
is quite common in Northern Spain [23,24], ticks of the
genus Hyalomma seem to be endemic of southern and
eastern parts of the country and reports on its presence in
Northern Spain are only sporadic [7,8,25]. In this sense,
recent data (S. Jiménez, personal communication) have
revealed the recent emergence of Hyalomma ticks in cattle
in La Rioja (a province in Northern Spain), suggesting that
the distribution of Mediterranean theileriosis might be
changing, probably due to changes in climatic conditions
and vegetation that affect vector distribution.
Infection with Babesia species accounted for 9.1% of the
samples corresponding to 3.0% of B. major, 2.7% of B.
bigemina, 2.2% of B. bovis and 1.1% of B. divergens. However, this is the first time that B. major and B. divergens are
detected in Spain using molecular techniques. In previous
reports species identification had been based on morphological examinations by microscopy. Tick vectors associated to these species seem to be H. punctata and I. ricinus,
respectively [26], which are very abundant in Northern
Spain [23,24]. B. bovis is regarded as the most pathogenic
bovine Babesia species and so far in Spain it had only been
reported in Balearic Islands (Eastern Spain) [27], although
it had been identified before in Southern and Western
Spain by microscopy examination [7]. B. bovis is transmitted by ticks of three genera (Ixodes, Rhipicephalus and
Boophilus) [26], although only the first two are found in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/16

Northern Spain. In our study we found 6 positive samples
from 3 farms in Northern Spain with a history of piroplasmosis. In two farms B. bovis was detected in 3 of 4 samples, and 2 out of 6, respectively. In the third farm,
samples had been submitted to the laboratory at four different time points (four samples) throughout 3 years with
reports of unspecific clinical signs. In addition to B. bovis,
T. annulata and T. buffeli were also detected in one animal
each, suggesting that different piroplasms were circulating
within that farm. However, in none of the 6 positive samples was B. bovis found in a mixed infection.
Again, as in the case of single infections, T. buffeli was also
the most prevalent species in mixed infections. It
appeared in 11 of them (78.6%), in combinations of two
or even three, with all the other species except B. bovis.
This was the only species never found in combination
with other piroplasms in our study, although Almeria et
al. [3] found it in a mixed infection with Theileria sp.
Opposite to B. bovis, B. bigemina was only detected as a
mixed infection with either T. buffeli or T. annulata or
both. This same situation was also found by Almeria et al.
[3]. Although the number of samples with mixed infections is relatively small, the association of certain
piroplasm species and not others in mixed infections
might be linked to the tick vectors present in the vegetation of a certain area.
The 72 samples with positive RLB hybridisation but negative microscopy, corresponded in most of the cases to
infections with Theileria species (75.0% of T. buffeli and
15.3% of T. annulata) and to lesser extent with Babesia species (13.9%). These samples (except for B. major and B.
bovis) had haematology values within the normal ranges
suggesting that they would correspond to animals that
have overcome the parasitaemia but remain as carriers of
the haemoparasite. These chronic asymptomatic carriers
may serve as reservoirs of the infection and therefore be of
serious concern in terms of piroplasmosis control. The
lower prevalence of Babesia species detected among carrier
cattle as compared to carriers of Theileria spp., also
observed in sheep and horses [18,19], would be explained
by the fluctuations in parasitaemia that occur during the
chronic phase of infection by Babesia species [9,28,29] or
the low numbers of intraerythrocytic piroplasms in the
circulating bloodstream of Babesia carriers [30].

Conclusion
This study revealed that subclinical infections are common and that bovine piroplasmosis does not have a clear
pattern that allows clinicians to undoubtedly identify animals with babesiosis or theileriosis, particularly in the latter case, in which clinical signs can be highly unspecific.
Therefore, sensitive and specific laboratorial tests like RLB,
which clearly identify the parasite and can detect asymp-

tomatic carriers, are essential to establish good control
measures and to avoid unnecessary treatments. In the
light of the advantages of RLB, a universal macroarray
could be designed to identify all possible piroplasms
infecting livestock. The present work is the continuation
of our previous studies dealing with the genetic diversity,
epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of piroplasms
infecting horses and sheep [18,19]. The application of
macroarrays to piroplasm discrimination would help to
investigate the host susceptibility and parasite-host specificity relationships.

Methods
Clinical samples
A total of 263 bovine blood samples submitted between
the years 2000 and 2004 to the Diagnostic Service of
NEIKER were included in this study: 88 with clinical suspicion of piroplasmosis (hyperthermia, anaemia, and/or
haemoglobinuria, icterus, associated to tick infection)
and 175 from animals with unspecific signs (anorexia,
body weight loss, reduced milk production, abortion and
reproductive failure) for which haemoparasites analysis
was requested. Samples were collected from 77 farms
from the northern half of Spain and two from Southern
Spain. The number of samples submitted from each farm
varied from 1 to 30 with the following distribution: 1
sample from 38 farms, 2–10 samples from 36 farms and
11–30 samples in 5 farms. Blood samples submitted in
EDTA containing tubes were analysed by haematological
and parasitological examination, and stored at -20°C
until subsequent DNA purification and hybridisation
analysis.
Haematological and microscopy examination
Leukocyte and erythrocyte counting was carried out with
an electronic counter (Iber-cell, Barcelona, Spain). Packed
cell volume (PCV) was measured by the standard microhaematocrit method, and haemoglobin concentration
was determined by a colorimetric assay in a spectrophotometer. Leukocyte differential counting was carried out
by thin blood smears stained with Giemsa and analysed
under an oil-immersion objective, differentiating at least
100 cells. Giemsa-stained slides were searched for intracellular forms with morphology compatible with Theileria
or Babesia under an oil-immersion objective (100 ×).
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for DNA purification from whole
blood and DNA yields were determined with a NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, DE, USA).

PCR amplification and RLB hybridisation
Prior to reverse line blot (RLB) hybridisation the hypervariable V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene of the genera
Theileria and Babesia was amplified using primers RLB-F
(5'-GACACAGGGAGGTAGTGACAAG-3') and RLB-R
(biotin-5'-CTAAGAATTTCACCTCTGACAGT-3') (MWG
Biotech AG, Germany), as adapted by Georges et al. [17].
Reactions were performed in 25 µl volumes as previously
described [18,19]. Oligonucleotide probes containing a
N-(trifluoroacetamidohexyl-cyanoethyl, N,N-diisopropyl
phosphoramidite [TFA])-C6 amino linker were synthesised by MWG Biotech AG (Germany). Sequences of the
oligonucleotide probes used are summarised in Table 2.
The oligonucleotides were diluted in 160 µl of 500 mM
NaHCO3 (pH 8.4) to a final concentration of 8 µM. Preparation of RLB membrane and hybridisation were carried
out as previously described [18,19]. After developing, the
PCR products were stripped from the membrane [18,19]
and membranes reprobed a maximum of 8 times.

Plasmids including the amplicon of the V4 region of the
18S rRNA gene of each of the six species analysed were
constructed as previously described [18,19] and used as
positive controls. To monitor for false-positive results,
negative controls included during DNA extraction and
PCR amplification were subjected to RLB hybridisation.
Statistical analysis
Haematimetric variables, microscopic and RLB data were
submitted to analysis of variance and comparison of
means using the GLM procedure on the SAS statistical
package (Version 8.0). Comparison of frequencies for testing associations between piroplasm types and clinical disease were carried out with Chi square or Fisher exact tests.
P values less than 0.05 were considered significant, and
quantitative results are presented as mean ± standard
error.
