Abstract
Background: Complex mutants can be selected under sequential selective pressure by HBV therapy. To determine
hepatitis B virus genomic evolution during antiviral therapy we characterized the HBV quasi-species in a patient
who did no respond to therapy following lamivudine breakthrough for a period of 14 years.
Case Presentation: The polymerase and precore/core genes were amplified and sequenced at determined
intervals in a period of 14 years. HBV viral load and HBeAg/Anti-HBe serological profiles as well as amino
transferase levels were also measured. A mixture of lamivudine-resistant genotype A2 HBV strains harboring the
rtM204V mutation coexisted in the patient following viral breakthrough to lamivudine. The L180M+M204V
dominant mutant displayed strong lamivudine-resistance. As therapy was changed to adefovir, then to entecavir,
and finally to entecavir-tenofovir the viral load showed fluctuations but lamivudine-resistant strains continued to be
selected, with minor contributions to the HBV quasi-species composition of additional resistance-associated
mutations. At the end of the 14-year follow up period, high viral loads were predominant, with viral strains
harboring the lamivudine-resistance signature rtL180M+M204V. The precore/core frame A1762T and G1764A
double mutation was detected before treatment and remaining in this condition during the entire follow-up.
Specific entecavir and tenofovir primary resistance-associated mutations were not detected at any time. Plasma
concentrations of tenofovir indicated adequate metabolism of the drug.
Conclusions: We report the selection of HBV mutants carrying well-defined primary resistance mutations that
escaped lamivudine in a fourteen-year follow-up period. With the exception of tenofovir resistance mutations,
subsequent unselected primary resistance mutations were detected as minor populations into the HBV
quasispecies composition during adefovir or entecavir monotherapies. Although tenofovir is considered an
appropriate therapeutic alternative for the treatment of entecavir-unresponsive patients, its use was not effective in
the case reported here.

Background
Hepatitis B infection affects two billion people worldwide and nearly 350 million individuals are chronically
infected. If left untreated, about one-third will develop
progressive and possibly fatal liver disease [1]. Drugs
inhibiting viral replication achieve higher treatment
response compared to IFN-[alpha] or pegylated-IFN[alpha], although relapse is common when treatment is
interrupted. Treatment with lamivudine, a viral polymerase inhibitor, results in a rapid 4-5 Log10 decline in viral
load and it has shown to improve liver histology after
one-year treatment [2-4]. A major limitation is the
emerging resistance mutations within the viral polymerase gene, resulting in a resistance rate of approximately
20% per year [5]. Adefovir dipivoxil is an alternative
which develops slow resistance rates compared to lamivudine, with different patterns [6,7].
Another alternative is entecavir, rapidly metabolized to
its active triphosphate metabolite [8]. A 7 Log10 and a 5
Log10 decline is observed when 0.5 mg dose is used in
nucleoside-naïve hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive
and HBeAg-negative patients, respectively. When a double dose is administered (1 mg daily), it is also effective
against lamivudine-resistant strains, yet with lower viral
load reduction vs. wild type [9-11]. The resistance rates
observed with entecavir are still lower considering that
HBV DNA rebounds were exhibited in only 2% of
nucleoside-naïve patients treated with entecavir for up to
2-year therapy [12]. Such rate was also minor in those
lamivudine-refractory patients during 2 years of entecavir
treatment [13].
Another drug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate -an acyclic
nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor-, showed
potent activity in wild-type and lamivudine-resistant
HBV in HIV-HBV coinfected and HBV monoinfected
patients [14-17].
In this 14-year follow-up study (1996-2010), we
described a therapeutic dilemma where adefovir, entecavir
and entecavir-tenofovir non-response is progressively
observed in a patient that previously experienced lamivudine resistance.
Case Presentation
A 47-year-old woman (weight: 62 kg) was diagnosed with
chronic active HBeAg-positive hepatitis B in 1996. Viral
parameters such as HBeAg, antiHBe IgG and HBV plasma
viral load from frozen samples were simultaneously measured by a unique operator to reduce intra and inter-assay
variations. HBeAg and anti-HBe were determined by electrochemiluminescence (ELECSYS 2010, Roche Diagnostic). HBV viral load levels were determined by real time
PCR (COBAS TaqMan Roche Molecular Systems,
dynamic range 30 IU/ml to 110,000,000 IU/ml) [18]. Liver

inflammation was measured by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.
For sequence analysis, HBV pol and preC-core genes
were sequentially sequenced with primers as previously
described [19]. The analysis was performed using an
ABI3100 instrument (Applied Biosystems), and the
sequences introduced in this work as well as those
obtained from the GenBank database were aligned with
ClustalX v1.83 [20] and edited with Bioedit v7.0.9.0 [21].
The HBV genotype was assessed by phylogenetic inference using the Neighbor-joining algorithm with the
Kimura-two-parameter model of molecular evolution in
the MEGA v3.1 software [22].
Sequences from both genes were obtained at different
time-points during antiviral therapy (Figure 1). A more
detailed HBV pol gene clonal analysis was performed on
seven selected viral isolates from serum samples harvested during sequential therapies. Each selected PCR
product of pol gene was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) and at least 15 clones were
further analyzed by sequencing. This allowed analysing
the evolution of viral quasispecies under the successive
antiviral pressures based on analysis of the pol gene.
The anti-HBV treatment interventions accompanied by
the HBV viral load and ALT level kinetics are depicted in
figure 1. Therapy was initiated when HBV viral load rose
to 6.5 × 106 IU/ml. In 1998 when the patient was treated
with IFN-[alpha] 5 MU thrice weekly for 30 weeks, the
HBV DNA level was lower than the detection limit. This
therapy was interrupted and replaced in 1999 by lamivudine (150 mg once a day). After 2 years of continuous
treatment, HBV DNA was detectable (15.5 × 106 IU/ml).
HBeAg remained negative with detectable anti-HBe during this period of treatment. In 2001, after a 6-month discontinuation, HBV DNA level evidenced a post-treatment
flare (1 × 108 IU/ml). At the end of 2003 lamivudine therapy was reintroduced (150 mg once daily). It was accompanied by a rare event of reversion to an HBeAg-positive/
anti-HBe negative profile, which remained detectable for
two years. The viral load reached 3.1 × 106 IU/ml at this
point.
Ten months later, in 2006, the lamivudine regimen was
replaced by adefovir monotherapy (10 mg/day). Initially,
viral load levels were low (8.5 × 104 IU/ml) but after 48
weeks of therapy these levels reached 7.15 × 106 IU/ml.
ALT levels were normal during this interval. Reactivation
of HBV replication was assumed considering the simultaneous detection of HBeAg/anti-HBe [17] and the high
replication detected. The concurrence of HBeAg and
anti-HBe does not appear to be uncommon among antiviral treatment-naïve patients, but its prevalence in therapy-experienced patients is unknown. This serological

treatment (IFN: interferon; LMV: lamivudine; ADV: adefovir; ETV: entecavir; TDF: tenofovir). In the superior panel the HBeAg/antiHBe

pattern has been related to extensive hepatocyte damage
and severe immune-mediated liver injury and consequent
dysfunction [23]. Six months later, ALT level slightly
increased (1.5× upper-normal limit - UNL -) and entecavir monotherapy was instituted (1 mg daily).
After a 5-month entecavir monotherapy, tenofovir
(300 mg once daily) was added to the treatment regimen
for dual therapy. The HBV DNA declined to 1 × 10 5
IU/ml for four months, but three months later the viral
load reached > 1.1 × 10 8 IU/ml. Additionally, an
increase in the ALT level (20× UNL) denoted liver
inflammation. During the following 48 weeks, the viral
replication slightly decreased to 6.1 × 10 6 IU/ml but
rebounded first to 3.6 × 107 IU/ml and later to > 1.1 ×
108 IU/ml. More recently (second semester 2010), HBV
DNA levels fluctuated between 4.3 × 104 IU/ml and 4.9
× 107 IU/ml. By the end of the study follow-up, we were
able to measure tenofovir concentration in plasma by
high performance-liquid chromatography in three consecutive samples 20 hours after administration reaching
71.6 ng/ml ± 47.6 (mean ± SD).
The ALT-AST levels remained slightly elevated (2×
UNL) during the last two years of follow-up.

HBV isolates from the patient were ascribed to genotype A2 based on phylogenetic relatedness among partial
HBV genomic sequences from both pol and preC-C
genes. A further longitudinal genotypic analysis, including quasispecies composition of HBV strains isolated
from the patient revealed the presence of resistance
mutations based on pol gene sequences (Table 1). At the
beginning of lamivudine treatment, HBV was wild-type
in all clones. After 2 years under such therapy, this viral
population was completely replaced by mutation rtM204I
-homogenously exhibiting lamivudine resistance. When
this therapy was interrupted for 6 months, quasispecies
composition almost exclusively consisted of wild-type pol
nucleotide sequences, except for a minor contribution (<
10%) showing the adefovir resistance-associated mutation
I233V. Once lamivudine therapy was reintroduced, and
until entecavir plus tenofovir were administered, the dual
lamivudine resistance-associated mutations rtL180M and
rtM204I were invariably detected. Under the latter therapeutic scheme, only ephemerally and with minor contribution (~5%), the A181T and T184L lamivudine-adefovir
and entecavir resistance-associated mutations were
detected, respectively.

Additionally, another two variations were detected in
the reverse transcriptase catalytic domain at the time of
lamivudine resistance. These rtA200V and rtI253V variants remained present during entecavir therapy, and
were also detected in samples sequenced after breakthrough during entecavir therapy.
The HBV genomic characterization at preC-C level
showed the presence of A1762T and G1764A double
mutation that was early detected when the patient was
untreated, remaining in this condition during the entire
follow-up. The T1753C mutation was also consistently
detected. The presence of these core promoter mutations are also related to the above-mentioned HBeAgantiHBe concurrent profile found in this patient, as
recently reported [23].

Discussion
In this study, we described the dynamics of HBV genomic
changes and other related parameters (ALT level, HBeAg/
antiHBe profile and viral load) during a 14-year period
that included sequential monotherapy with lamivudine,
adefovir, entecavir, and entecavir-tenofovir in a chronically
HBV-infected patient. This patient initially treated with
interferon, later consecutively resistant to lamivudine, adefovir, and entecavir -either as monotherapy or combined
with tenofovir- showed viral and biochemical resistance
with higher HBV DNA levels and only transient viral suppression. It was expected to find viral replication impairment when rtA181T mutation was detected under
adefovir monotherapy, since this variant has a secretory
defect and exerts a dominant negative effect on wild-type
HBV virion secretion. Thus, this mutation is usually
detected as a mixed population with wild-type [24].
This patient showed persistent HBV replication as the
major determinant of the emerging genomic mutations
[7,25].

Entecavir is a 100-300 fold more potent inhibitor of the
wild-type viral polymerase compared to lamivudine-resistant polymerase, when the sensitivity is decreased in a 20150 fold [26,27]. In this clinical setting, entecavir 1 mg
once daily has been proven to be effective in the treatment
of lamivudine-resistant patients [9,11]. In presence of the
rtL180M and rtM204V as well as entecavir-associated
mutations, the susceptibility to entecavir decreased dramatically as seen by an increase in inhibitory concentration
50% (IC50) values from 280 to over 1500 fold [28].
Persistent viral replication and the error rate of HBV
reverse transcriptase (~10-4 base/replication cycle) are
major factors in the development of resistance [29].
The viral polymerase characterization in our patient at
quasispecies level showed lamivudine-associated mutations rtL180M and rtM204V/I during adefovir, entecavir
and entecavir-tenofovir therapies.
During the entecavir monotherapy we observed no
viral suppression and tenofovir 300 mg once daily was
added to the therapy resulting in a rapid 2 Log10 decline
in viral load. This level was sustained for seven months
until a viral rebound and biochemical breakthrough were
observed. In spite of the fact that the A181T adefovirresistance and the T184L entecavir-resistance mutations
were present in the background, they were only minor
components of the HBV quasispecies that emerged once
tenofovir was added in two consecutive samples separated by a five-month interval. The alanine at position
181 seems to be critical in the development of resistance
to nucleos(t)ide analog, since it is located in a-helix adjacent to the nucleotide binding site [30]. Taking into
account that the availability of free replication space is
necessary for the spread of the mutant virus, the kinetics
of emerging drug-resistant mutants is usually slow. Such
HBV variants became neither dominant in the two highly
replicative (~10 8 IU/ml) viral populations nor were

Cassino et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:178

detected three months later. The intrinsic resistance of
the mutant and its replicative fitness could explain the
time to its emergence as well as the ephemeral contribution to HBV quasispecies. In addition, taking into
account that the clonal analysis was performed on some
samples with low viremia levels, the consequent reduction in the number of viral species detected could hamper the interpretation of results.
This behaviour in HBV is remarkably different from that
described in two recently reported cases showing entecavir
resistance with a similar therapeutic background [31,32].
The A194T mutation that appears to lead to an over tenfold decrease in tenofovir sensitivity [33] was not detected
in the HBV quasispecies composition of those previous
isolates during entecavir-tenofovir therapy.
The combination of the rtL180M+ rtM204V mutations
harbored by our patient results in a replicative fitness of
about 50% of that shown by the wild-type virus [28,31].
Additional mutations able to restore replicative fitness to
similar levels in the wild type such as rtV173L and
rtP177S were not found. These factors may explain, in
part, the difference in resistance rates between entecavir
and lamivudine, as more profound genetic changes are
necessary for a mutant to become the dominant strain.
The role of the rtA200V and rtI253V mutations found
during lamivudine therapy is not clear. Their impact on
sensitivity and replication fitness is unknown, but nevertheless, they remained present during entecavir monotherapy or combined entecavir-tenofovir therapy, which
may imply a certain influence of these mutations [34].
Future in vitro research should clarify their impact on
drug sensitivity and replication fitness.
In spite of the fact that adefovir and tenofovir are active
against lamivudine resistant mutants, their activities
decrease [14,27,35,36], and lamivudine mutations appear
to have an impact on the therapeutic efficacy of adefovir
in this clinical setting [6,37]. Also, it is important to consider that adefovir monotherapy in lamivudine-experienced patients is a treatment modality that carries a
significant risk of resistance in the long term. Current
guidelines recommend that it could be overcome by the
adefovir-lamivudine combination therapy [38].
Considering that HBV viral load exhibited intermittent
long-term fluctuations under a constant therapy during
the follow-up, an inadequate adherence appears to be a
plausible cause for treatment failure since an inadequate
absorption or altered metabolism does not seem to
impact in this case in view of the concentration of drug
found in plasma [39]. The viral load decline was fast in
the short term, which additionally supports a probable
adequate drug metabolism but it needs to be determined by further accurate pharmacokinetic studies.
Based on our findings and the available data on HBV
resistance, and in lieu of the fact that tenofovir is an

Page 5 of 6

appropriate therapeutic alternative for entecavir-refractory patients, in this case tenofovir was not efficacious.

Conclusion
This case shows that the lack of response to tenofovir
combined with entecavir can occur in lamivudine-adefovir refractory patients chronically infected with HBV
with incomplete viral suppression. On the basis of our
findings, patients in whom tenofovir is used as a treatment option for entecavir-resistant hepatitis B should be
closely monitored.
