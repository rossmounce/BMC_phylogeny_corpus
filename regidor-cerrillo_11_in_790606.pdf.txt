Abstract
In this study, we examined the in vitro invasion and proliferation capacities of the Nc-Liv and ten Spanish Neospora
caninum isolates (Nc-Spain 1 H - Nc-Spain 10). The invasion rate was determined as the number of tachyzoites that
completed their internalisation into MARC-145 cells at 2, 4, and 6 h post-inoculation (pi). The proliferation rate was
evaluated by determining the doubling time during the exponential proliferation period. Significant differences in
the invasion rates of these isolates were detected at 2 and 4 h pi (P < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test). At 4 h pi, the NcSpain 4 H and Nc-Liv isolates displayed the highest, while the Nc-Spain 3 H and Nc-Spain 1 H isolates had the
lowest invasion rates (by Dunn’s test). Variations in the proliferation kinetics of these isolates were also observed.
Between different isolates, the lag phase, which occurs before the exponential growth phase, ranged from 8 to 44
h, and the doubling time ranged from 9.8 to 14.1 h (P = 0.0016, ANOVA test). Tachyzoite yield, which combines
invasion and proliferation data, was also assessed and confirmed marked differences between the highly and less
prolific isolates. Interestingly, a direct correlation between the invasion rates and tachyzoite yields, and the severity
of the disease that was exhibited by infected pregnant mice in previous works could be established for the isolates
in this study (Spearman’s coefficient > 0.62, P < 0.05). The results of this study may help us to explain the
differences in the pathogenicity that are displayed by different isolates.
Introduction
Neospora caninum is an obligate intracellular parasite
that is phylogenetically related to Toxoplasma gondii
and causes neuromuscular disease in dogs and abortion
in cattle, although it can infect other host species [1,2].
Neosporosis is currently recognised as one of the main
causes of infectious bovine abortion worldwide [1].
Previous studies have demonstrated that differences
occur in the genetic and biological characteristics of N.
caninum isolates. Thus, genetic diversity among N. caninum isolates has been detected using different polymorphic markers [3], including those that are based on
microsatellite sequences, which were demonstrated to be
the most suitable for typing N. caninum isolates [4-8].
Importantly, N. caninum isolates exhibit differences in

their capacity to produce pathology in cerebral mouse
models [9-12], and in their efficacy to be transmitted from
dams to offspring [13-16]. Genetic and biological intraspecific diversity of N. caninum isolates may influence
their capacity to produce disease in the natural host, and
the clinical presentation and epidemiology of neosporosis.
Very little information is known about the inherent
factors of this parasite that contribute to its intra-specific pathogenicity, but the capacity to produce pathology has been associated with the behaviour of different
N. caninum isolates in the host. The dissemination
capacity, the parasite burdens that are reached in target tissues, the ability to avoid the immune response
produced against the infection by the host and the rate
of tachyzoite-bradyzoite conversion in the host may all
contribute to the different levels of pathogenicity that
are caused by different isolates [11-13,16,17]. Previous
in vitro studies have reported that the growth [18,19]
and bradyzoite conversion rates [14,20,21] are variable

among different N. caninum isolates. Additionally, the
low pathogenicity levels of the Nc-Spain 1 H isolate in
mice and cattle have been attributed to the low viability rate and tachyzoite yield of this isolate in cell cultures [14,15]. Therefore, similar to T. gondii, the
inherent pathogenicity of different N. caninum isolates
may be directly related to specific virulence traits,
which include the migration capacity, the ability to
cross barriers and the cell invasion and intracellular
proliferation efficiencies [22-25].
In this work, we investigated the association between
the in vitro phenotypes that were displayed by N. caninum isolates and their pathogenicity. Specifically, we
examined the invasion efficiencies and the intracellular
proliferation kinetics of eleven N. caninum isolates,
including the naturally attenuated NcSpain-1 H isolate
and the highly pathogenic Nc-Liverpool isolate, which
showed profound differences in their vertical transmission characteristics and their capacities to induce
pathology in pregnant cattle [14,26].

Materials and methods
Cell cultures, parasites and preparation of N. caninum
isolates for in vitro assays

The N. caninum isolates that were used in this study are
shown in Table 1. The Spanish N. caninum isolates and
the Nc-Liverpool (Nc-Liv) isolate were routinely

maintained in a monolayer culture of the MARC-145
monkey kidney cell line after reactivation from cryovials,
as described previously [5]. The Nc-Liv isolate was
previously passaged in a mouse and re-isolated in
MARC-145 cell cultures as described previously [16], to
minimise the occurrence of potential alterations in its
biological characteristics due to prolonged cell culture
maintenance, as has been previously reported [27]. The
N. caninum isolates that were used in these in vitro
assays were subjected to a limited number of culture
passages (Table 1).
The tachyzoites that were used in the in vitro assays
were recovered from 3.5-day growth cultures, when the
majority of the parasites were still intracellular (at least
80% of the parasite vacuoles were undisrupted in the
cell monolayer), and purified using PD-10 (Sephadex
G-25) columns (GE-Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK)
prior to cell monolayer inoculations [28]. The tachyzoite
inoculation dose was previously optimised for the maintenance of each isolate to estimate the recovery of
tachyzoites from infected cultures under optimal conditions (actively replicating) at 3.5 days post-inoculation
(pi). Infected cell cultures were scraped with a plastic
cell scraper, harvested by centrifugation at 1 350 g for
10 min and suspended in Dulbecco Minimum Essential
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with a 2% antibioticantimycotic solution (Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK), 10 mM

HEPES and 2% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum
(FBS). The FBS employed in all in vitro assays was from
the same production batch. Disrupted cell cultures were
passed through 25 gauge needles, and tachyzoites were
purified with PD-10 columns that had been previously
equilibrated with the medium mentioned above. Tachyzoites were eluted from the columns with 5 mL of medium, and the number of tachyzoites was determined by
trypan blue exclusion followed by counting in a Neubauer chamber. Tachyzoites were then resuspended at
the required doses (2 × 105 tachyzoites/mL). Tachyzoite
purification was performed at 4°C, and MARC-145
monolayers were inoculated within one hour of tachyzoite collection from flasks.

analysed using a laser scanning cytometer. Polyclonal
rabbit anti-N. caninum antiserum was raised in female
New Zealand White rabbits (Harland Interfauna S.A.,
Barcelona, Spain) as described [30].
Laser scanning cytometry

The coverslips were analysed on a CompuCyte laser
scanning cytometer LSC (CompuCyte, Cambridge, MA,
USA) equipped with a BX50 upright fluorescence microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY, USA). A 60.8
mm2 (4.4 mm radius) circular area was scanned with a
20× objective, an argon ion excitation laser (488 nm),
and two detection filters (530/30 (green) and 650 LP
(red)). Data were acquired and analysed using Wincyte
3.4 software (CompuCyte).
Invasion rate determination

In vitro invasion assays

Host cell invasion was measured using a double (red/
green) immunostaining probe that was described previously [28] and a laser scanning-cytometer-based assay
that was previously described for T. gondii [29], with
several modifications. All of the isolates were assayed in
triplicate, and all of the assays were performed in three
independent experiments. The Nc-Liv isolate was
included as a control in each batch of experiments.
Additionally, MARC-145 monolayers that were not
inoculated were immunostained and included as negative controls in each assay.
Double immunofluorescence staining

Purified parasites (2 × 105 tachyzoites) were added onto
MARC-145 monolayers that had grown to confluence
on circular (13 mm diameter) glass coverslips and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator. At
specific time periods (2 h, 4 h and 6 h pi), the coverslips
were washed three times with 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed for 15 min in a 3% formaldehyde/0.05% glutaraldehyde solution and blocked with
3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) in PBS for 30 min. After blocking,
the samples were labelled for 1 h with a 1:4000 dilution
of a hyperimmune rabbit antiserum that was directed
against N. caninum tachyzoites in PBS/0.3% BSA,
washed three times with PBS and then labelled for 1 h
with a 1:100 dilution of a secondary goat anti-rabbit
IgG that was conjugated to PE-Cy5.5 (red, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). After washing, the samples were
permeabilised with 0.25% Triton X-100 and blocked
with PBS/3% BSA for 30 min. Parasites were then
labelled with the rabbit anti-tachyzoite serum as
described above, washed, and labelled with a 1:1000
dilution of a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated
to Alexa Fluor 488 (green, Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA). Finally, the coverslips were washed, mounted
on slides embedded with a 40% glycerol/2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in PBS and

The invasion rate (IR) was determined to be the number
of green events (extracellular and intracellular parasites)
minus the number of red events (extracellular parasites)
per scanned field at specific times (2 h, 4 h and 6 h pi).
Negative controls (the MARC-145 monolayer that was
not inoculated) were included to eliminate potential
fluorescent artefacts. No events were observed in the
negative control samples.
In vitro intracellular proliferation assays

Proliferation kinetics were determined by quantifying
the number of tachyzoites at specific times (4 h, 8 h,
20 h, 32 h, 44 h, 56 h, and 68 h pi) by real-time PCR
(qPCR). All of the isolates were assayed in triplicate, and
all of the assays were performed in three independent
experiments. The Nc-Liv isolate was included in each
batch of experiments as mentioned above, and MARC145 monolayers that were not inoculated were used as
negative controls for PCR analyses.
Culture conditions

MARC-145 cells were grown to confluency in 24-well
tissue culture plates. Purified N. caninum parasites (2 ×
105 tachyzoites) were added to the monolayers at time 0
and incubated for 4 h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Next, the
non-invading parasites were removed by washing the
monolayer three times with DMEM/2% heat-inactivated
FBS/2% antibiotic solution. The cultures were subsequently maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 for the time periods mentioned above. The samples were visualised by
light microscopy to monitor parasite proliferation prior
to their collection. Then, the media were removed
and the cell cultures were recovered in 200 μL of PBS,
180 μL of lysis buffer and 20 μL of proteinase K
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The samples were transferred
to Eppendorf tubes and were frozen at -80°C prior to
DNA extraction.
DNA extraction and real-time PCR

Genomic DNA was extracted from cellular samples
using the BioSprint 96 workstation and the BioSprint 96

Regidor-Cerrillo et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:41
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/41

DNA blood kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Genomic DNA was eluted in a final volume
of 100 μL.
Quantification of N. caninum DNA was performed by
real-time PCR targeting the Nc-5 region as described
previously [31]. A total of 5 μL (100 ng) DNA was used
for the PCR amplifications. The number of N. caninum
parasites was calculated by interpolating the corresponding Ct values (cycle threshold value, which represents
the fractional cycle number reflecting a positive PCR
result) on a standard curve that was generated in each
real-time PCR run by assaying 10-fold serial dilutions of
parasite DNA, which was equivalent to 10-1-105 tachyzoites. All of the tachyzoite quantifications were assessed
from average values obtained from duplicate determinations. DNA extracted from the uninfected MARC-145
monolayer was also included as a negative PCR control
in each batch of reactions.
Proliferation rate, doubling time and tachyzoite yield
determinations

The proliferation rate (μ) and doubling time (Td) were
assessed for each assay during the exponential multiplication period by applying non-linear regression analysis
and an exponential growth equation using GraphPad
Prism 5 Demo, v. 5.00 software (GraphPad, San Diego,
CA, USA). The μ and Td for each isolate were defined
as the average value obtained from all of the determinations that revealed a linear regression, R2 ≥ 0.95.
The tachyzoite yield (TY56h) was defined as the average value of the number of tachyzoites quantified by
qPCR at 56 h pi.
Data statistics and correlation analysis

Differences between IRs determined over successive
time points for each isolate were compared using the U
Mann-Whitney test (2 h versus 4 h, 2 h versus 6 h, 4 h
versus 6 h). The Kruskal-Wallis test was employed for
comparisons among the IRs shown for the different isolates within each time point (2 h, 4 h, and 6 h pi).
When statistically significant differences were found
with the Kruskal-Wallis test, a Dunn’s multiple-comparison test was applied to examine all of the possible pairwise comparisons. A one-way ANOVA test, followed by
the Tukey’s multiple range tests, was employed to compare the Tds and TY56hs assessed for each isolate. Statistical analyses were carried out using a dataset composed
of the values determined for each replicate obtained
from the three independent experiments. The significance for these analyses was established at P < 0.05.
The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (r) was
applied to investigate the potential association between
the in vitro parameters evaluated in this study (IR 2h ,
IR4h, IR6h, Td, TY56h) and the neonatal morbidity, mortality and vertical transmission rates induced by these

isolates in a well-established pregnant mouse model
(Table 1) [14,16].
Statistical and correlation analyses were performed,
and graphics were generated using GraphPad Prism 5
Demo, v. 5.00 software (GraphPad).

Results
Invasion rate comparisons

The IRs (the median number of intracellular events) of
almost all isolates significantly increased from 2 h to 4 h
pi or from 2 h to 6 h pi (P < 0.05, U Mann-Whitney
test), with the exception of the Nc-Spain 9 isolate. However, no significant differences were found between the
IRs of most of the isolates at 4 and 6 h pi. The IRs were
only observed to significantly increase from 4 h to 6 h
pi for the Nc-Spain 1 H and Nc-Spain 10 isolates.
Significant differences were also found among the IRs
of different isolates at 2 and 4 h pi (P < 0.0001, KruskalWallis test) (Figure 1A and B). At 2 h pi, the Nc-Spain
4 H, Nc-Spain 8 and Nc-Liv isolates exhibited the highest IRs (IR 2h ) in comparison to the IR 2h s of the NcSpain 3 H, Nc-Spain 6 and Nc-Spain 10 isolates, which
displayed the lowest values (by Dunn’s test). At 4 h pi,
the Nc-Spain 4 H and Nc-Liv isolates exhibited significantly higher IRs (IR4h) than the Nc-Spain 3 H and NcSpain 1 H isolates when they were analysed by the
Dunn’s test. Significant variations among the IRs of the
isolates were also detected at 6 h pi (P = 0.046, KruskalWallis test), although no differences were found in pairwise analyses between the IRs of the different isolates
(Figure 1C).
Proliferation kinetics, proliferation rate determination and
doubling time comparisons

The parasite proliferation kinetics of each N. caninum
isolate was studied by plotting the numbers of tachyzoites, which were determined by qPCR, against the
specific collection time periods (Figure 2A). After
being inoculated onto MARC-145 cell monolayers,
tachyzoites did not multiply for a specific period of
time, which is known as the lag phase. The lag phase
of the different isolates varied between the time
periods of 8 h (Nc-Spain 10), 20 h (Nc-Spain 4 H,
Nc-Spain 5 H, Nc-Spain 7, Nc-Spain 6 and Nc-Liv), 32
h (Nc-Spain 1 H, Nc-Spain 3 H and Nc-Spain 9) and 44
h (Nc-Spain 2 H, Nc-Spain 8) (Figure 2A). After the lag
phase, an exponential proliferation phase was observed
that persisted until 56 h pi for 3 of the 11 isolates
(Nc-Spain 4 H, Nc-Spain 5 H and Nc-Spain 7 isolates)
and until 68 h pi for the other 8 isolates (Figure 2B).
Microscopic visualisation of the inoculated cultures
prior to collection verified that some parasitophorous
vacuoles with tachyzoite pairs were first observed for
most of the isolates at 20 h pi. After 32 h, the number of

egression from cell monolayers. The TY 56 h values
were significantly different between isolates (P <
0.0001 by 1-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test)
and varied from 1 731 (Nc-Spain 8) to 36 170 tachyzoites (Nc-Spain 7) (Figure 4). At 56 h pi, the isolates
that were already undergoing exponential proliferation
from 20 h pi (Nc-Spain 4 H, Nc-Spain 5 H, Nc-Spain
6, Nc-Spain 7, Nc-Spain 10 and Nc-Liv) had significantly higher TY56 h values than the other four isolates
(Nc-Spain 1 H, Nc-Spain 2 H, Nc-Spain 3 H, and NcSpain 8), which began to exponentially proliferate after
20 h pi (Figure 4).

[14,16]. Wide ranges in the morbidity, mortality and
vertical transmission rates were observed (Table 1),
suggesting a relevant role of the implicated isolate in
the outcome of infection in pregnant mice. Because
the in vitro IRs, Td and TY56 h values also varied significantly within this population of isolates, Spearman
correlation analyses were applied to determine whether
a potential association existed between the in vitro
characteristics of isolates and their ability to be vertically transmitted and produce disease in mice. No correlations could be discerned between the Td or IR2 h
values and vertical transmission, neonatal morbidity or
neonatal mortality rates. Additionally, no correlation

Discussion
The apicomplexan parasite N. caninum is an obligate
intracellular parasite. The processes of parasite invasion,
adaptation to new intra-cytoplasmatic conditions, intracellular proliferation, and egress from host cells constitute successive steps involved in the lytic cycle of N.
caninum and other apicomplexa [32-34]. These processes are required for the maintenance and multiplication of the parasite in vitro and for parasite survival and
propagation in the course of animal infection in vivo. As

a result of a primo-infection or the reactivation of a
Neospora infection in a chronically infected animal,
tachyzoites rapidly disseminate throughout the body of
the host, invade cells of different organs and cause cell
death. Cell death results in the release of parasites,
which develop new lytic replication cycles, thus allowing
the infection to spread and cause disease [1]. Therefore,
the processes involved in parasite invasion and intracellular proliferation are crucially important for understanding the pathogenesis of disease and for the
development of protective vaccines and effective drug
therapies. Recently, different studies have been performed to understand the precise mechanisms involved
in the processes of the N. caninum lytic cycle, which
includes parasite invasion [28,35,36] and egress [37].
However, intraspecific differences related to the efficiency of the lytic cycle processes, such as invasion and
proliferation, and their association with isolate pathogenicity in vivo have been poorly investigated. The most
detailed study in this regard was performed by Schock
et al. [19], which revealed that differences occurred in
the growth rates of six N. caninum isolates, although
their potential correlation with virulence was not examined. Moreover, the isolates in this previous study were
maintained by an undetermined number of culture passages, which could modify the original growth rate and
pathogenicity of the isolates [27]. Attenuation of virulence, accompanied by faster multiplication in vitro has
been previously demonstrated in N. caninum and
T. gondii parasites maintained for extended periods in
cell cultures, which may have been due to adaptation of
the isolates to cell cultivation [27,38]. In this study, we
comparatively examined the in vitro invasion efficiencies
and proliferation kinetics of the active tachyzoite stage
of eleven different N. caninum isolates, which were
maintained with limited passages in cell cultures from
their original isolation [5,14].
The IRs determined in this study demonstrated that the
tachyzoites from most of the N. caninum isolates penetrated cell monolayers 2 to 4 h pi. In previous studies,
tachyzoites from the Nc-1 N. caninum isolate penetrated
bovine aorta endothelial cell cultures 45-60 min after

inoculation [28]. After the initial penetrations, an insignificant increase in the number of invading tachyzoites
was detected from 4 to 6 h pi. This slight increase was
likely due to the loose invasion capacity of the remaining
tachyzoites that had not invaded that monolayer at 4 h pi
[28,35]. These results were similar to the results reported
by Hemphill et al. [28], who observed that maintaining
Nc-1 tachyzoites extracellularly at 37°C for time periods
longer than 4-6 h resulted in decreased infectivity of the
parasite. The observed differences in the invasion time
periods of N. caninum tachyzoites may also have been
influenced by the experimental conditions and the host
cell types used in each experiment. N. caninum can be
maintained in vitro in a wide variety of well-established
cell cultures, and thus, this parasite can invade a wide
range of cell cultures, although N. caninum tachyzoites
from different isolates may have different affinities for
specific cell types. Based on this theory, the failure to isolate parasites in CV-1 and M617 cells from a clinically
affected KO mouse can be attributed to the limited invasion and growth characteristics of the specific isolate in
these cell lines [39]. This theory may also explain the natural host range and the tissue tropism displayed by N.
caninum during infection. Moreover, in previous studies,
substantial differences were observed in the cell invasion
processes of the closely related N. caninum and T. gondii
parasites, which could explain their dissimilar host preferences [35]. However, different N. caninum isolates,
including those that were assayed in this study, could all
be adapted to the MARC-145 cell line through a limited
number of cell passages [5,14,18]. Therefore, the significant differences in the invasion efficiencies observed in
this study could be attributed to the biological diversity
of these N. caninum isolates. Throughout the experiments, the IRs determined for the Nc-Spain 4 H and NcLiv isolates were significantly higher than the IR of the
Nc-Spain 3 H isolate. Furthermore, the IRs determined
for the Nc-Spain 4 H and Nc-Liv isolates were significantly higher than the IR of the Nc-Spain 1 H isolate at 4
h pi (Figure 1).
The intracellular proliferation kinetics also varied
between the isolates that were analysed. Significant

Regidor-Cerrillo et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:41
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/41

differences in the lag period, which ranged from 8 to 44
h pi, were observed between the isolates. Additionally,
after the exponential proliferation period, the egress period, which occurred 56 to 68 h pi, was only detected in
some of the isolates. Furthermore, we did not microscopically visualise parasitophorous vacuoles containing two
or more tachyzoites until 20 h pi, and the cellular rupture releasing the tachyzoites was observed for some of
the isolates from 56 h pi. The exponential proliferation
period is delimited by the lag phase and the tachyzoite
egress phase for each isolate.
The Td values, which signify the μ, also varied from
approximately 10 to 14 h, and significant differences in
the values were detected between the isolates. Our
results were similar to the results previously obtained
for the Nc-1 isolate, which displayed a lag period of
10-12 h and a Td of 14-15 h using human foreskin
fibroblasts [40]. However, we must consider, as we did
for the IRs, that the proliferation kinetics may have
been influenced by the host cell lines used in these
assays [39]. In fact, previous studies on T. gondii have
demonstrated that differences in tachyzoite multiplication occur based on the cell lines used as hosts [41].
Variations in the IR, Td (proliferation rate) and the
exponential proliferation period will determine the
number of tachyzoite division cycles reached and the
tachyzoite yield attained in vitro and in vivo. Significant differences in the TY 56 h values were apparent
between the isolates based on comparative analysis,
and the isolates clearly grouped into two populations:
“highly prolific” and “less prolific” (Figure 4). Interestingly, the severity of histopathological lesions and clinical signs have been directly related to the parasite
burdens in the brains of experimentally infected mice
[11,12,42-45] and to the spread of the parasite in foetal and placental tissues from infected pregnant cattle
[1,15,26,32,46]. Furthermore, an association between
the severity of histological lesions and parasite burdens was established in studies performed in bovine
foetuses that were naturally aborted during different
periods of pregnancy [47]. Therefore, the high dissemination rate, the ability to cross biological barriers
(blood-brain barrier and placenta) and the enhanced
invasion and proliferation rates of different N. caninum isolates may contribute to host tissue damage
and to the severity of clinical signs in vivo. In support
of this hypothesis, we observed that the isolates with
the highest IRs (Nc-Spain 4 H and Nc-Liv) caused the
highest morbidity in dams and the highest morbidity
and mortality in neonates (100% succumbed to infection), while the isolates with the lowest IRs (Nc-Spain
1 H and Nc-Spain 3H) induced lower neonatal mortality in a pregnant mouse model [14,16]. Furthermore ,
the “highly prolific” and “less prolific” isolate

Page 9 of 11

populations contained isolates that displayed the highest (Nc-Spain 5 H and Nc-Spain 7) and lowest (NcSpain 2 H and Nc-Spain 3H) parasite burdens and the
levels of histopathological lesions in the brain during
the chronic phase of infection in a cerebral mouse
model, respectively [12]. Interestingly, this system of
ordering grouped the isolates that had the highest and
lowest capacities to produce disease in the pregnant
mouse model together (Table 1) [14,16]. Based on
these observations, the association between the in
vitro IRs and TY 56 h values for these isolates and the
neonatal morbidity, mortality and vertical transmission
rates produced by these isolates in mice was investigated through a correlation analysis. A direct correlation between the IR4 h and IR6 h values when invasion
was completed, as well as the TY 56 h value and their
pathogenicity in mice was established, suggesting that
the in vitro invasion and proliferation rate traits are
related to the in vivo virulence of the N. caninum isolates, at least in the pregnant BALB/c mouse model.
Moreover, the Nc-Spain 1 H isolate (a “less prolific”
and less invasive isolate in this study) had a limited
ability to induce foetal death in a pregnant bovine
model [15]. High growth rates due to a higher reinvasion capacity, but not due to significant variations
between isolate-specific Tds, have also been recognised as a virulence trait in T. gondii [25], though
pathogenesis in toxoplasmosis has mainly been found
to be related to the inflammatory immune response
against infection by specific T. gondii types [22,48].
However, virulence factors, such as the ROP18 and
ROP16 rhoptry proteins, have recently been identified
in T. gondii, and the ability of ROP18 to increase the
intracellular proliferation of this parasite has been specifically suggested to cause enhanced virulence of the
parasite [23,25,49]. Because the outcome of N. caninum infection is affected by a combination of host,
parasite, and external factors, these factors need to be
considered collectively when establishing direct associations between the in vitro and in vivo behaviour of
N. caninum isolates. Various parasite factors, which
include the efficacy of disseminating and crossing host
barriers, may also be different between N. caninum
isolates, as described for T. gondii isolate types I, II
and III [22,23]. Therefore, differences may also exist
between N. caninum isolates in the number of parasites that are able to spread throughout the host and
colonise target organs (brain and placenta) and, consequently, the tachyzoite yield reached in the target tissues, the outcome of an infection and the
transmission of the parasite to foetuses in pregnant
animals. These differences may explain the lack of a
correlation found between the IRs and TY 56 h values
with vertical transmission rates.

Regidor-Cerrillo et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:41

Interestingly, the genetically identical Nc-Spain 1 Nc-Spain 10 and Nc-Spain 3 H - Nc-Spain 4 H isolates
displayed significant differences in their in vitro behaviour, as well as in their pathogenicity in mice [14,16].
Both pairs of isolates were obtained from the same dairy
herd, but from different calves, and therefore, they
could be considered as different isolates that may
include genetic variations in other loci that were not
examined.
In summary, this study showed that there is intraspecific diversity in the invasion rate and proliferation
kinetics of different N. caninum isolates. More interestingly, the correlation found between the in vitro
characteristics of the isolates with their in vivo pathogenicity in pregnant mice and their offspring confirms
that invasion and proliferation rates are virulence
traits in N. caninum. Within apicomplexan parasites,
host cell invasion and intracellular proliferation are
tightly regulated processes that involve the sequential
secretion of components from specialised organelles
(micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules). A large
number of these secreted elements and their interactions have already been identified in T. gondii [24].
Some of these elements, such as the ROP18 and
ROP16 proteins, are virulence factors in T. gondii
[23,25,49]. In contrast to T. gondii, the role of orthologous microneme, roptry and dense granule proteins in
N. caninum is still unclear. In addition, cell culturebased approaches have demonstrated significant differences between T. gondii and N. caninum species
[32,35]. Further studies are necessary to identify the
molecular mechanisms within N. caninum that are
directly involved in mediating the differences observed
between various isolates.
