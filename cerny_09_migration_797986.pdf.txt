Abstract
Background: Chad Basin, lying within the bidirectional corridor of African Sahel, is one of the most
populated places in Sub-Saharan Africa today. The origin of its settlement appears connected with
Holocene climatic ameliorations (aquatic resources) that started ~10,000 years before present (YBP).
Although both Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo language families are encountered here, the most diversified
group is the Chadic branch belonging to the Afro-Asiatic language phylum. In this article, we investigate
the proposed ancient migration of Chadic pastoralists from Eastern Africa based on linguistic data and test
for genetic traces of this migration in extant Chadic speaking populations.
Results: We performed whole mitochondrial genome sequencing of 16 L3f haplotypes, focused on clade
L3f3 that occurs almost exclusively in Chadic speaking people living in the Chad Basin. These data
supported the reconstruction of a L3f phylogenetic tree and calculation of times to the most recent
common ancestor for all internal clades. A date ~8,000 YBP was estimated for the L3f3 sub-haplogroup,
which is in good agreement with the supposed migration of Chadic speaking pastoralists and their linguistic
differentiation from other Afro-Asiatic groups of East Africa. As a whole, the Afro-Asiatic language family
presents low population structure, as 92.4% of mtDNA variation is found within populations and only 3.4%
of variation can be attributed to diversity among language branches. The Chadic speaking populations form
a relatively homogenous cluster, exhibiting lower diversification than the other Afro-Asiatic branches
(Berber, Semitic and Cushitic).
Conclusion: The results of our study support an East African origin of mitochondrial L3f3 clade that is
present almost exclusively within Chadic speaking people living in Chad Basin. Whole genome sequencebased dates show that the ancestral haplogroup L3f must have emerged soon after the Out-of-Africa
migration (around 57,100 ± 9,400 YBP), but the "Chadic" L3f3 clade has much less internal variation,
suggesting an expansion during the Holocene period about 8,000 ± 2,500 YBP. This time period in the
Chad Basin is known to have been particularly favourable for the expansion of pastoralists coming from
northeastern Africa, as suggested by archaeological, linguistic and climatic data.

Background
Africa is the site of the greatest human migrations [1] both
in terms of quantity and geographic range, but the extent
of this influence is not reflected in current genetic surveys.
To date, most studies of migrations within Africa have
focused almost exclusively on the Bantu migration, by
which Bantu languages together with some cultural innovations were distributed throughout Central, Eastern and
Southern Africa from the present Cameroon-Nigerian
border. Genetic consequences of this gene flow have been
well documented in present populations [2-5]. However,
the Bantu language-gene spread is likely not the only dispersal to have left genetic traces in African extant populations.
Another important dispersal within Sub-Saharan Africa
was the migration of Chadic speaking pastoralists, which
has been well studied by linguists and archaeologists but
not by geneticists. Chadic is one of the few well established branches of the complex Afro-Asiatic language phy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/63

lum and is mainly spoken in West-Central Africa (Chad,
Northern Cameroon, Northern Nigeria and Southeastern
Niger) in an area centered around Lake Chad (Figure 1). It
is considered the most diversified, with ~150 languages,
and perhaps the most ancient subgroup within the AfroAsiatic phylum [6,7]. Within the Afro-Asiatic family, some
authors relate Chadic to Cushitic, recognising a common
Cushitic-Chadic node [7], but this classification remains
controversial.
According to linguistic analyses of Afro-Asiatic branches,
the common ancestors of extant Chadic and Cushitic peoples inhabited East or Northeast Africa ~7,000–8,000
years before present (YBP) [8,6]. Subsequently, probably
in connection with progressive desertification of the
Sahara [9] and increased herding of livestock, two different migrations spread out of the "Cushitic-Chadic motherland". The westward migration (~7,000 YBP)
contributed to the separation and diversification of the
Chadic languages in Chad Basin, while the southward

migration (~5,000 YBP) contributed to the diversification
of Cushitic languages in Eastern Africa [10,8,6].
Since more than 2,000 kilometers separate the putative
proto-Afro-Asiatic homeland in Northeastern Africa from
Lake Chad and there are no Chadic or Cushitic speaking
populations living in between these regions, some
authors have proposed diverse hypotheses to explain the
process by which ancient Chadic speaking peoples arrived
to the Lake Chad region. Ehret [8] suggested a two step
migration model; proto-Chadic people expanded westward to the northern half of the Sahara and later migrated
southward through the central Sahara into the Lake Chad
Basin. The "Inter-Saharan hypothesis" was developed by
Blench [6], who suggested that Chadic speaking herders
left their Cushitic-Chadic motherland in the Nile Valley
and wandered through the large dry river system of Wadi
Howar towards Lake Chad. This second hypothesis is documented linguistically by similarities of words for domesticated animals shared in Cushitic and Chadic and also by
numerous archaeological findings. Some archaeological
finds are located in Western Sudan, such as the so-called
"leiterband" pottery that shows tight connections to Neolithic Khartoum [11,12] and were found at several sites
along the Wadi Howar where the ancient pastoralists
camped.
When Chadic speaking herders arrived at Lake Chad, they
were certainly not the first inhabitants of the area. From
the beginning of its settlement, the greater area of the
Chad Basin acted as a center of gravity for neighbouring
populations of both Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan origin [13]. Archaeological excavations around Lake Chad
have documented several cultural changes tightly linked
with oscillating climatic phases [14,15]. Uninterrupted
settlement is associated with the Early Holocene (~8,0005,000 YBP) and the establishment of the first settled communities [16-18,13]. The earliest evidence for settlement
is in Dufuna in the Upper Yobe valley along the Komadugu Guna River in Northern Nigeria where the oldest
boat (~8,000 YBP) on the African continent has been
unearthed [19]. More information comes from Konduga,
also in Nigeria and dated to 8,340 ± 250 YBP, which has
yielded Neolithic artefacts such as potsherds decorated
with combed incisions and polished stone industry. Additional archaeological findings, such as terracotta figurines
of Bos sp. and bones of goats and sheep and even domesticated cattle clearly demonstrate the presence of animal
husbandry [20,21]. However, there is no archaeological
evidence concerning the nature of contacts between
immigrating Chadic speakers and the original Sudanic
farmers. Linguistic evidence, however, suggests that both
groups may have cooperated in the past, i.e. Chadic loans
of some basic Saharo-Sahelian terms [8].

Complete mitochondrial genome sequences are the most
informative genetic data to evaluate hypotheses of past
human migrations from a maternal perspective. In fact,
the increased resolution of phylogenetic reconstructions
and more robust estimates of the time to the most recent
common ancestor (TMRCA) enabled by whole mitochondrial genome sequences have facilitated improved models
of human migrations, such as Out-of-Africa [22,23], the
settlement of Oceania [24-26] and the colonization of
Americas [27-30].
Previous research on mitochondrial diversity in the Chad
Basin (based on hypervariable segment I [HVS-I] and
diagnostic coding variants) led us to identify two potential autochthonous Chad Basin mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) haplogroups [31]. One was L3e5, with an age of
11,450 ± 3,800 years that is concordant with a Holocene
expansion; this haplogroup is also seen in North African
groups. The other haplogroup, tentatively named L3f2,
was found almost exclusively in Chadic speaking groups
with an estimated TMRCA of 28,950 ± 11,600 YBP.
The rarity of haplogroup 'L3f2' outside the Chad Basin
was confirmed in a broad phylogeographical survey of
624 complete L-type genomes in Africa by [5]. Only two
'L3f2' sequences were described: one from Chad and one
from Ethiopia. This work led also to some modifications
in L3f nomenclature: the L3f2 in [31] was changed to L3f3
in [5] while a new subhaplogroup L3f2 was defined based
on a polymorphisms at 16311, which is no longer used to
define L3f, and 745iT.
A unique feature of Chadic speaking people is their unusually high frequency of L3f3 haplotypes. We identified
this sub-haplogroup in 14 samples from 173 Chadic
speaking individuals (8.1%) and in only 2 samples from
275 non-Chadic speaking individuals (0.7%). In this
study, we perform whole genome sequence analysis of
L3f3 haplotypes in Chad Basin populations in order to
conduct a high-resolution characterization of the subhaplogroup and more robust TMRCA estimation of its
expansion. Specifically, we sequenced 16 different L3f
haplotypes from Chad Basin, of which 14 belong to the
L3f3 sub-haplogroup.

Results
L3f phylogeny
Sixteen new mtDNA genomes from Chad Basin populations and 29 whole L3f genomes published elsewhere (see
Additional file 1) were used to construct a phylogenetic
tree (Figure 2) and to estimate the time to the most common ancestor (TMRCA) (Table 1). The tree confirms the
main points of Behar study [5], but has important additional phylogenetic features based on the Chad Basin
sequences.

sented by two sub-haplogroups, ancestral L3f1 and
derived L3f1b that carries two control region variants
16292–16311 [3] as well as six coding variants. The long
branch leading to L3f1b may indicate constant population size and/or strong genetic drift throughout the dry climatic conditions during the last glacial period. On the
other hand, the recent age for sub-haplogroup L3f1b of
15,900 ± 2,600 YBP (or 15,000 ± 3,000 YBP if not including the divergent sequence number 13) and its star-like
phylogeny suggests a population expansion in the African
population bearing its ancestral motif during the climatic
improvement after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).
Subsequently, other L3f1b sub-haplogroups emerged in
the Holocene; L3f1b1 11,600 ± 3,900 YBP, L3f1b2 6,400
± 3,000 YBP, L3f1b3 12,800 ± 5,700 YBP and L3f1b4
11,600 ± 5,300 YBP. The youngest clade, L3f1b2, seems to
be more frequent in the Middle East. L3f1a seems to be
older (37,700 ± 10,000 YBP) than its sister sub-haplogroup L3f1b and is also less diversified. A few samples
from Chad belong to these sub-haplogroups: two to L3f1a
and one to L3f1b3.
Sub-haplogroup L3f2 is only defined by the highly recurrent control region variant 16311 and insertion 745T.
However, it contains very divergent lineages resulting in a

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:63

very old age for this sub-haplogroup (53,100 ± 11,200
YBP). One L3f2b sample was observed in Chad.
The clearest difference between the tree presented here
and the L3f portion of the Sub-Saharan L-tree depicted in
[5] is the "Chad Basin" clade L3f3. Robusticity of this
clade is unambiguously supported by 10 coding variants.
The TMRCA of this sub-haplogroup is 8,000 ± 2,500 YBP,
an estimate concordant with both archaeological and linguistic data. The only non-Chad Basin sequence in this
subhaplogroup is from Ethiopia, although it has a very
divergent sequence suggesting it is evolutionarily distinct
from the Chad Basin sequences; the TMRCA estimate for
L3f3 without this Ethiopian sequence is 6,500 ± 2,500
YBP.
In order to obtain additional information on L3f frequency distributions, we examined the current dataset of
5,046 published African HVS-I mtDNA sequences (Additional file 2) and identified 315 individuals with L3f
sequences for a total of 129 different haplotypes. We constructed a network based on these sequences (Additional
file 3) and were only able to identify sub-haplogroups
L3f1b, L3f1b1 and L3f3 (with some recurrence) because
of the lower resolution of HVS-I compared to whole
genome sequences. Nevertheless, the higher frequency of
L3f3 in Chadic speaking individuals is confirmed and the
TMRCA of the L3f ancestral motif (54.6 ± 12.1 kya) is in
good agreement with that obtained by Behar et al. [5] (see
their Supporting figure 1) and with our dates (see Figure 2
and Table 1). Again, as in [31], HVS-I age estimate for L3f3
is older (15.9 ± 7.5 kya excluding recurrent and 22.3 ± 7.1
kya including recurrent sites) than the one obtained based
on the coding-region information. However, the network
based on the expanded Africa dataset suggests a possible
new haplotype defined by the motif 16278-16294-1630116354. Tentatively, this cluster can be dated to 10,900 ±
4,100 years ago, so it chronologically corresponds with
most of the Holocene L3f1b clades and with the Chadic
L3f3 as well. This sub-haplogroup seems to be frequent in
Chadic and non-Chadic speaking populations of Central
Africa and northeastern Africa.
Population structure
Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses can provide further
insight into the genetic diversification of Chad Basin populations, allowing us to compare geography and language
as the main influences on population structure. First, we
tested the influence of linguistic affiliation on HVS-I
mtDNA variability by grouping Chad Basin and other
Afro-Asiatic populations living outside this area (a total of
44 populations) according to language groups (Semitic,
Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, Nilo-Saharan, and NigerCongo). We observed that only 3.4% of variation was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/63

found among linguistic groups and only 4.0% within
groups. Similarly, when these populations were grouped
according to their geographic location (North Africa,
Chad Basin, Ethiopia, and Tanzania), the distribution of
variability proportions was 5.5% among regional groups
and 3.0% within groups. These results show a similarly
low effect of language and geography in determining population structure in and around the Chad Basin. With
both linguistic and geographic groupings, the vast majority of mitochondrial variation (about 92%) partitioned
within populations, testifying to a low level of population
structure.
We then estimated pairwise FST genetic distances between
populations (Additional file 4) and displayed these on a
MDS plot (Figure 3). Interesting results are immediately
evident – while Chadic populations form a relatively
homogeneous group, the Cushitic populations split into
two completely different clusters. The first group is composed of Horn of African populations, such as Ethiopian
and Somali Cushitic populations, which are close to
neighbouring Ethiopian Semitic speaking groups and relatively close also to Chadic people from the Chad Basin.
The second Cushitic group is composed by more southern
groups from Tanzania, i.e. Burunge and Iraqw, who
occupy outlier positions even within the Afro-Asiatic MDS
plot. In the MDS plot, geography is more strongly associated with genetic distance than is linguistic affiliation.
Overall, we observe that Chadic speaking populations are
intermixed with other populations from Chad Basin,
including Niger-Congo, Semitic, and Berber speaking
people. In this context, it seems that the linguistic categories play a secondary role in structuring the genetic diversity.

Discussion
We use high-resolution genetic data to investigate the
genetic and linguistic support for hypotheses concerning
the population history in the Chad Basin. The mitochondrial L3f3 haplogroup is found almost exclusively in
Chadic speaking populations and its TMRCA corresponds
well with archaeological and linguistic dates of the proposed migration of Chadic speaking pastoralists from East
or North East Africa to the Chad Basin.
Our TMRCA estimates (Table 1) and signatures of population expansions (Figure 2) for L3f1b and L3f3 appear to
correlate well with the paleoclimatic record in African
Sahel, another highly overlooked data source in African
genetic studies. This omission is surprising as the Sahara
is a region of dramatic environmental changes, with many
oscillatory phases between arid-uninhabitable desert and
humid-fertile landscape of lakes and savannah. These
changes are driven by glacial cycles, with glacial conditions in the northern hemisphere being associated with

cold and arid conditions over northern Africa (reviewed in
[34]). Our results suggest that following the emergence of
L3f in East Africa soon after the Out-of-Africa migration
[5] around 57,100 ± 9,400 YBP, genetic drift and/or
demographic decline occurred throughout the dryer, second part of Late Pleistocene. This conclusion can be
inferred from the very long branches leading to many of
the L3f sub-haplogroups. A dryer period in the latter part
of the Late Pleistocene is supported by fossil evidence
showing that during the LGM, some 21,000 YBP, the
Sahara desert covered a much larger area than today [34].
Subsequently, in the post-Last Glacial Maximum when
climatic conditions had improved, an opportunity for
population expansion and consequent mutation fixation
again occurred, detectable mainly in our L3f1b data.
L3f1b is widespread throughout Africa and has also dispersed into the Middle East with evidence of several new
Holocene-emerging sub-haplogroups. In fact, the Sahara
was repopulated during the first half of the Holocene
when humid conditions and greening were established by
~10,000 YBP, leading to the Holocene Climatic Optimum. The Optimum lasted till ~6,000 YBP, when the shift

towards more permanent aridity occurred culminating
with the formation of the current Sahara Desert. Additionally, several lines of evidence suggest that a linguistically
distinct part of the East African population migrated to the
climatically suitable Chad Basin; specifically, our data
demonstrate that the Chadic-specific L3f3 clade expanded
during the Holocene. The age for L3f3 clade, based on
mtDNA coding region diversity (8.0 ± 2.5 kya), is remarkably concordant with archaeological findings for the
proto-Chadic migration. This clade might be then considered as a strong genetic signature of the Chadic migration,
which is highly correlated with paleoclimatic conditions.
We can parallel the role played by L3f sub-haplogroups in
climatic-related human population expansions in the
Sahara/Sahel region with the western Eurasian sub-haplogroups V [35], H1 and H3 [36-38]. These haplogroups are
European genetic signs of a re-settlement of the continent
from an Iberian refugium, after the improvement of climatic conditions post-Last Glacial Maximum. As phylogenetic inferences improve, genetic signs of population
contractions and expansions related with broad intense
climatic changes are expected to be detected.

Conclusion
We provide genetic support for an Early Holocene migration within Africa. A high-resolution phylogeny of haplogroup L3f based on whole mitochondrial genome
sequences shows several clades that are unevenly distributed throughout Africa and Near East. Specifically, clade
L3f3 is geographically limited to the Chad Basin where it
reaches high frequencies especially in Chadic-speaking
groups while almost absent in Niger-Congo and NiloSaharan people. Within the Afro-Asiatic language phylum, the Chadic branch is linguistically close to the East
African Cushitic branch although they are separated by
~2,000 km of territory in which different Semitic and
Nilo-Saharan peoples live today. We show that only
northern Cushitic groups from Ethiopia and Somalia are
genetically close to Chadic populations. Thus, the archaeologically and linguistically supported route of protoChadic pastoralists via Wadi Howar to the Chad Basin
may have genetic support. Moreover, our molecular
genetic date for the Chadic-specific L3f3 clade is consistent with the suggested Holocene dispersal.

Methods
Whole genome sequencing of L3f3
In two previous publications [39,31], HVS-I sequence
analysis of five Chadic-speaking populations from the
Chad Basin was performed. Study populations included
those from northern Cameroon such as the Hide and the
Mafa living in the Mandara Mountains (N = 23 and N =
32, respectively), the Kotoko of the Shari basin (N = 56),
the Masa of the Logon basin (N = 32) and the Buduma of
the northwestern shore and islands of Lake Chad in Niger
(N = 30). All populations speak their own language
broadly classified as Central Chadic branch within AfroAsiatic language phylum. Sequences were classified into
haplogroups, following specifications described in [31],
leading to the identification of a high proportion of L3f
haplotypes (defined by the sequence mutation motif
16209–16223 when compared to the revised Cambridge
Reference Sequence or rCRS [40].

In the present study, a total of 16 different L3f haplotypes
from the Chad Basin L3f sequences were chosen for whole
genome sequencing (accession numbers FJ625845–
FJ625860) using 32 primers (see [41] for primer
sequences and PCR specifications). Amplicons were purified and sequenced using the forward primers. In some
cases (e.g. the poly-C stretches between nts 568–573 and
16184–16193), the reverse primer was used. Sequencing
was performed on a ABI 3100 DNA Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Forster City, CA). Chromatograms were evaluated by two independent observers (MC and LP) with
the help of SeqScape (Applied Biosystems) and BioEdit
version 7.0.4.1 [42]. In cases of ambiguous results, new

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/63

PCR amplification and sequencing reactions were performed.
Phylogenetic analysis
A L3f phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the new
16 Chad sequences and 29 previously published whole
L3f genomes (see Additional file 1). A preliminary network analysis [43] and information published in [5] led
to a suggested branching order for the tree. Projected
shape of phylogenetic tree (estimation of the length of the
branches) was tested by means of PAML 3.13 [44], assuming the HKY85 mutation model with gamma-distributed
rates (approximated by a discrete distribution with 32 categories). For calculation of the time to the most recent
ancestor (TMRCA) for specific clades in the phylogeny, 
statistics (mean divergence from inferred ancestral haplotype) were used with a coding region (nts 577–16023)
mutation rate estimate of one transition per 5138 years
[45]. Standard errors were calculated as in [46].
HVS-I networks
We also constructed a L3f network using HVS-I sequences
(nts 16090–16365) that carried variant 16209 chosen
from an expanded African population database listed in
the Additional file 2 (all L0a2 sequences with 16209 were
discarded). Networks were constructed using the reduced
median algorithm (Network 4.5.0.0), followed by the
median joining algorithm to resolve intermediate nodes
[43]. For the total dataset of 315 haplotypes, a reducing
factor of one was used, instead of the default value of two
[43]. For calculation of the TMRCA,  statistics were used
with a HVS-I mutation rate of one transition per 20,180
years [47]. The standard deviation of the  estimator was
calculated according to [46].
Population structure
Analysis of population structure was calculated using Arlequin software version 3.0 [48]. For AMOVA, computations were based on haplotype frequencies. Two
groupings were performed: (1) by language branches and
(2) by geographic regions. FST genetic distances for all
populations in the Additional file 2 as well as for a subset
of Afro-Asiatic speaking populations and populations
inhabiting Chad Basin were calculated using HVS-I
mtDNA sequences. FST distances were transformed to Slatkin linearized form and visualized by non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) using PROXSCAL included in
the SPSS 10.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
