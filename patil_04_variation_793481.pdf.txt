Abstract
Background: In animal pathogenic bacteria, horizontal gene transfer events (HGT) have been
frequently observed in genomic regions that encode functions involved in biosynthesis of the outer
membrane located lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As a result, different strains of the same pathogen can
have substantially different lps biosynthetic gene clusters. Since LPS is highly antigenic, the variation
at lps loci is attributed to be of advantage in evading the host immune system. Although LPS has
been suggested as a potentiator of plant defense responses, interstrain variation at lps biosynthetic
gene clusters has not been reported for any plant pathogenic bacterium.
Results: We report here the complete sequence of a 12.2 kb virulence locus of Xanthomonas
oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) encoding six genes whose products are homologous to functions involved
in LPS biosynthesis and transport. All six open reading frames (ORFs) have atypical G+C content
and altered codon usage, which are the hallmarks of genomic islands that are acquired by horizontal
gene transfer. The lps locus is flanked by highly conserved genes, metB and etfA, respectively
encoding cystathionine gamma lyase and electron transport flavoprotein. Interestingly, two
different sets of lps genes are present at this locus in the plant pathogens, Xanthomonas campestris
pv. campestris (Xcc) and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac). The genomic island is present in a
number of Xoo strains from India and other Asian countries but is not present in two strains, one
from India (BXO8) and another from Nepal (Nepal624) as well as the closely related rice pathogen,
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoor). TAIL-PCR analysis indicates that sequences related to Xac
are present at the lps locus in both BXO8 and Nepal624. The Xoor strain has a hybrid lps gene
cluster, with sequences at the metB and etfA ends, being most closely related to sequences from
Xac and the tomato pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato respectively.
Conclusion: This is the first report of hypervariation at an lps locus between different strains of
a plant pathogenic bacterium. Our results indicate that multiple HGT events have occurred at this
locus in the xanthomonad group of plant pathogens.

Background
LPS is an important constituent of the outer membrane of

gram-negative bacteria. Variation in LPS composition can
have profound consequences for these cells by potentially

providing resistance against bacteriophages and antimicrobial compounds as well as facilitating evasion of the
host immune system in animal pathogens. Extreme variation at LPS gene clusters has been reported in animal pathogenic bacteria. Recently, eleven highly divergent gene
clusters were reported to occupy an LPSspecific locus in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen [1]. The acquisition by horizontal gene transfer of a
new LPS biosynthetic gene cluster in Vibrio cholerae is considered as a major cause for the cholera epidemic that
originated in India in 1992 [2]. In plant pathogenic bacteria, LPS is an important virulence factor and mutations in
the genes involved in LPS production result in severe virulence deficiency [3-8]. LPS has been shown to induce
resistance in plants against pathogens [9,10] and in some
recent studies, LPS is found to induce expression of plant
defense genes [11,12] as well as an oxidative burst reaction in cell cultures [13]. Since LPS recognition appears to
be an important aspect of plant defense responses, variation in lps gene repertoire is to be expected within different strains of plant pathogenic bacteria.
The genus Xathomonas includes a number of plant pathogenic bacteria. Two related members of this genus, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae
pv. oryzicola (Xoor) cause diseases of rice [14]. They
exhibit different tissue specificities with Xoo growing in
the xylem vessels while Xoor grows within the intercellular spaces of the parenchymatous tissue. Xoo causes bacterial leaf blight, the most serious bacterial disease of rice.
This disease is prevalent in many rice growing countries in
Asia, extending from the Indian subcontinent to Japan
and Korea. DNA fingerprinting studies using multi-locus
RFLP and PCR probes have indicated that there is extensive genetic diversity within Xoo strains isolated from various countries [15-19]. In India, multi-locus RFLP
profiling has indicated that one lineage of Xoo (called the
BXO1 lineage, based on the type strain for this group) is
widely distributed within the country. Strains within the
BXO1 lineage cluster together at about the 90 % similarity
level in a dendrogram. A second group of strains is quite
diverse, both at the haplotypic and pathotypic level, and
clusters with the BXO1 group at about the 55% similarity
level [19].
In previous research, we have reported a 5.5 kb region in
the genome of Xoo strain BXO1 and demonstrated that it
encodes three genes that are involved in biosynthesis of
LPS and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) as well as in
virulence [8]. All the three genes have atypical G+C content, as compared to the rest of the Xoo genome. In this
study, we have completed the entire sequence of this 12.2
kb genomic locus and indicate that it encodes three additional genes, wxoD, wzt and wzm, that are postulated to be
involved in LPS biosynthesis and transport. These newly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/40

described genes also have atypical G+C content and all the
six genes at this locus exhibit altered codon usage pattern,
as compared to other Xoo genes. We present evidence that
this locus is present in many, but not all, Xoo strains and
that it is absent in Xoor. Our results indicate that there is
substantial variation at this locus among various xanthomonads. The possible significance of these results is
discussed.

Results
Genetic organization of a Xoo lps locus
In an earlier study, a novel Xoo locus was reported to be
required for LPS and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS)
production as well as virulence. A 35 kb cosmid, pSD5,
that complements mutations in this region was isolated
[8]. Partial sequence (5.5 kb) of this locus indicated that
the region has atypical G+C content and contains three
genes which encode a predicted sugar nucleotide epimerase and two predicted glycosyl transferases. We report
here the complete 12.2 kb sequence and genomic organization of this locus in Xoo strain BXO1 (Fig. 1). The insert
in the pSD5 cosmid includes 7 EcoRI fragments (0.6, 2.2,
3.5, 4.0, 6.0, 9.0 and 10 kb). We subcloned all the fragments into pBlueScript. Based on the end sequences of the
inserts in the subclones and pSD5, the lps locus was
mapped to four of these EcoRI fragments (0.6, 4, 3.5 and
9 kb). The previously obtained sequence was found to
include all of the 3.5 kb and part of the 4 kb fragment and
the remaining sequence of this region was obtained by
sequencing the 0.6 kb and the 9 kb fragment (Please refer
Methods). A total sequence of 13.18 kb was constituted by
joining 6.14 kb of previously obtained sequence [8] and
7.04 kb of new sequence. The 13.18 kb sequence includes
12.2 kb of the lps locus and some flanking regions. The
additional sequence of the lps locus encodes three putative
genes which encode a predicted O-antigen acetylase, a
predicted ABC transporter permease and a predicted ATPbinding protein and three insertion sequence (IS)
elements.

All of the putative genes have been named as per Bacterial
Polysaccharide Genes Nomenclature (BPGN) [20]. The
first three genes, wxoA (encodes a predicted epimerase),
wxoB and wxoC (both encode predicted glycosyl transferases) have been described earlier. The fourth gene is
wxoD and encodes a predicted 327 amino acids long protein. A BLAST [21] search reveals strong homology to
acetyltransferases that are involved in LPS modification
and the best match is with an acetyltransferase from Mesorhizobium loti (MAFF303099; 34% identity and 46% similarity at amino acid level). Interestingly, no homologs of
this gene have been reported in any other xanthomonad.
The fifth gene, wzt, encodes a predicted 436 amino acid
long protein. A BLAST search reveals homology to functions involved in LPS transport. The best match is with the

ATPase component of an ABC-type polysaccharide transport system from Burkholderia fungorum (ZP_00033174.1;
47% identity and 65% similarity at amino acid level). The
sixth gene, wzm, encodes a predicted 437 amino acid long
protein which is homologous to integral membrane protein components of ABC transporter systems that are
involved in LPS transport. The best match is with a permease component of the ABC-type polysaccharide export
system
from
Pseudomonas

PfO-1
(ZP_00085342.1; 50% identity and 65% similarity at
amino acid level). The start codon of wzt overlaps with the
stop codon of wzm. Homologs of wzt and wzm are typically present in many lps gene clusters. Interestingly, two
complete Insertion Sequence (IS) elements (ISXo8 and
IS1113) and one truncated IS element (IS1114) interrupt

this cluster between the genes, wxoD and wzt. ISXo8 is a
novel 1320 bp long insertion sequence and a BLAST
search shows homology to transposase of ISRSO17
encoded by Ralstonia solanacearum (CAD17626; 51%
identity and 63% similarity at amino acid level). A complete copy of the IS1113 element (AF482989) and a truncated copy of the IS1114 element (AF232058) are also
present as indicated in Fig. 1. The presence of IS elements
is a marked feature of many lps loci [22]. Transcriptional
orientation suggests the possibility that ORFs wxoA, wxoB,
wxoC and wxoD might constitute one operon and that
ORFs wzm and wzt might be transcribed together. The
overlap between the start codon of wzt and the stop codon
of wzm also suggests that these two genes are co-transcribed.

The lps locus is flanked by metB, which encodes a predicted cystathionine gamma lyase, and etfA which
encodes a predicted electron transport flavoprotein. The
genome sequences of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc; infects crucifer plants like cabbage, cauliflower,
mustard, etc.) and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac;
infects citrus plants) have been obtained [23]. The Xoo
metB gene (a partial sequence of 642 bp is available)
exhibits within the sequenced region, 91% and 88%
nucleotide identity to metB genes of Xac (AE012010.1)
and Xcc (AE012157.1), respectively. The Xoo etfA gene (a
partial sequence of 328 bp is available) exhibits within the
sequenced region, 93% and 91% nucleotide sequence
identity, respectively, with etfA genes in Xac (AE012009.1)
and Xcc (AE012159.1). Interestingly, the lps biosynthetic
gene cluster of Xcc, which comprises fifteen genes, is also
located between the metB and etfA genes [24]. In Xac, this
gene cluster is missing at this locus and is replaced by a set
of fourteen genes, several of which are homologous to
functions involved in LPS synthesis and transport. The
gene clusters present at this locus in Xcc, Xac and Xoo have
distinct nucleotide sequences, gene numbers (15 genes in
Xcc, 14 genes in Xac, 6 genes in Xoo) and gene
organization.
The Xoo lps cluster is a genomic island
a) Atypical G+C content
The average G+C content of Xoo and other Xanthomonads is estimated to be around 65% [25], while the average
G+C content of the lps locus is 50.46% (excluding the IS
elements) [Fig. 1]. The variation is much more marked
among the genes, from as low as 45.0% (wxoD) to 56.3%
(wxoC). Atypical G+C content is a characteristic feature of
"genomic islands" that are believed to be acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The transposase genes encoded by
ISXo8 and IS1113 have a G+C content that is >61%, a
value which is typical for the genomes of Xoo and other
xanthomonads. The G+C content of metB and etfA genes
that flank the genomic island have G+C content of 64.3%
and 61% respectively (within the partial sequences that
have been obtained) which is typical of the Xoo genome.
b) Altered codon usage
An additional hallmark of a genomic island is the altered
codon usage. Here we present a simple and graphical way
of calculating and representing the codon usage differences and refer to it as Codon Usage Pattern or CUP
(Please refer Methods). Eight aminoacids, i.e., Glycine,
Valine, Threonine, Leucine, Arginine, Serine, Proline and
Alanine, were selected to study CUP because they have
atleast four synonymous codons. The percentage of synonymous codons that end with G or C was calculated for
each aminoacid and gene. This analysis was conducted for
six genes of the lps island and six genes from elsewhere in
the Xoo genome (please refer Methods). We show that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/40

CUP of the genes present in the genomic island is dramatically different from the typical Xoo genes (Fig. 2). The
%G+C at third codon position of synonymous codons for
amino acid Glycine is only 52.5 % for genes present in the
lps locus, while it is 78 % in case of Xoo genes that are
located elsewhere in the genome. Similarly, for amino
acids Valine, Alanine, Threonine, Serine, Arginine, Leucine and Proline the values are 46.6, 47, 59, 52, 53, 57 and
34.6 % respectively for genes at the lps locus, while the values are 84, 77.5, 89.5, 79.5, 75.6, 90.3 and 86.16 % for the
respective aminoacids in case of the typical Xoo genes.
Altered codon usage is a characteristic feature of horizontally acquired genes and CUP clearly indicates that the
Xoo lps cluster is a genomic island (Fig. 2).
The lps locus is present in the genomes of many, but not
all, Xoo strains
The presence of the genomic island in different Xoo
strains was assessed by PCR using gene specific primers,
for all the six lps genes, as described in the Methods. The
list of strains used in the study is given in the Table 1 and
the list of gene specific primers is given in Table 2. In order
to confirm that the genomic island is present at the same
genomic location in all strains, PCR was also performed
using two primer pairs that are designed to amplify fragments from metB to wxoA and wzm to etfA, respectively.
The analysis included nine Indian Xoo strains representing different geographic locations and the BXO1 and non
BXO1 groups. The list also includes twelve Xoo strains
from different Asian countries and a Xoor strain, BXOR1,
from India. Our study revealed that the genomic island is
present in the majority (7/8) of Xoo strains that we have
examined from India (Fig. 1). Four BXO1 group strains
(BXO4, BXO7, BXO13 and BXO479) and three of the
non-BXO1 strains (BXO5, BXO6 and BXO20) have the
genomic island. The genomic island is also present in two
strains each from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Korea and one strain from Nepal (Fig. 1, Table 1).
The lps locus is present, in all these strains, between the
metB and etfA genes. Interestingly, we find that the
genomic island is not present (as judged by PCR [Fig. 3A]
and Southern hybridisation [Fig. 3B]; see Methods) in the
genomes of Xoo strains BXO8 and Nepal624, as well as
the Xoor strain, BXORI. The results obtained with the
probes directed against the wxoA gene are presented but
similar results were obtained using probes that are specific
for the other five genes. The blots used above were reprobed as a positive control with a metB specific probe and
the results gave an expected size band in BXO1 (lane 1),
and different sized bands in BXO8 (lane 3), Nepal624
(lane 4) and BXOR1 (lane 2) indicating that the metB gene
is present but located in different EcoRI fragments (Fig.
3C).

BXO8, locus is absent from the genomes

The lps locus is absent from the genomes of Xoo
strains BXO8, Nepal624 and Xoor strain BXORI. (A)
PCR analysis using primers that are specific to wxoA gene. M
is the λ HindIII Marker lane. An expected band of 1 kb (indicated by arrow) is present in the Xoo strains, BXO1 (lane 1),
BXO5 (lane 3), BXO6 (lane 4) and BXO20 (lane 6) but
absent in BXO8 (lane 5), Nepal624 (lane 7) and BXORI (lane
2). (B) Southern hybridization analysis of EcoRI digested
genomic DNA using α-32-P labeled wxoA specific probe (see
Methods). A 4 kb band can be seen (indicated by arrow) in
BXO1 (lane 1) but not in BXORI (lane 2), BXO8 (lane 3) and
Nepal624 (lane 4). Similar results were obtained for wxoB,
wxoC, wxoD, wzm and wzt genes. (C) The blot from (B) was
deprobed and was hybridized with α-32P labeled probe specific to the metB gene. A specific band can be seen in all the
lanes. Note the sizes of the bands indicating that metB is
present in different EcoRI fragments in BXO1, BXORI and
BXO8/Nepal624.

BXO8 and Nepal 624 have sequences related to Xac at the
lps locus
What are the sequences present at this genomic location
in the Xoo strains that lack the lps locus? Thermal Asymmetric Interlaced (TAIL) PCR is an efficient technique for
isolation of target DNA segments adjacent to known
sequences [26]. TAIL-PCR and sequencing using primers
directed against the conserved flanking metB and etfA
genes suggests that sequences which are significantly similar to the Xac lps gene cluster are present at this genomic
location in both of these strains. Next to metB, a wzm
homolog is present in BXO8 (a partial sequence of 398 bp
is available) and Xac with 69.2% identity at nucleotide
level within the sequenced region. Next to etfA, a putative
integral membrane protein encoding gene is present in
both BXO8 (a partial sequence of 405 bp is available) and
Xac with 91.3% identity at nucleotide level within the
sequenced region. The BXO8 and Nepal624 strains
exhibit 100% nucleotide sequence identity within the
sequenced region. TAIL- PCR analysis of the Xoor strain
indicates that it has a hybrid lps gene cluster. Next to metB,
a unique wzm gene is located (a partial sequence of 548 bp
is available) which exhibits 62.8% nucleotide identity to
wzm gene of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain
DC3000 (AE016859.1). Next to etfA, a putative inner
membrane protein encoding gene is located (a partial
sequence of 402 bp is available) which exhibits 97% and
92% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively, with similarly located genes in BXO8 and Xac. Because the BXO8
and Nepal624 strains have different sequences at the lps
locus, as compared to other Xoo strains, we inoculated
these strains along with appropriate controls onto leaves
of the susceptible rice cultivar Taichung Native-1. We find
that BXO8 and Nepal624 strains are able to cause typical
bacterial leaf blight disease symptoms that are indistinguishable from those elicited by other Xoo strains (data
are not shown).
Presence of inverse repeats at the 3' ends of metB and
etfA genes that flank the lps locus
We have performed an alignment using BLAST2 [27] of
the nucleotide sequences derived from the metB and etfA
genes in BXO1 and BXO8. The homology breakpoints
appear to localise to the 3' regions of metB and etfA genes,
exactly 18 bp upstream of their respective stop codons.
Upto the break points, within the sequenced region at
either end of the lps locus, the nucleotide sequence is identical in BXO1, BXO8 and Nepal624. The DNA sequence
immediately preceding the break points was examined
manually for presence of direct or inverse repeats. Interestingly, we could find three inverted repeats (I, II and III)
within the 3' regions of metB and etfA near the homology
breakpoints between BXO1 and BXO8 (Fig. 4). The first
repeat is the smallest one (5 bp) and the third repeat is the
largest (11 bp). The second repeat is 6 bp long and is 7 bp

Invert repeat sequences flanking the lps gene cluster in the BXO1 strain of Xoo
Invert repeat sequences flanking the lps gene cluster in the BXO1 strain of Xoo. The horizontal arrows represent
the ORFs of metB and etfA. I, II, III represent three different invert repeats in the 3' regions of metB and etfA genes. The vertical
arrows represent the breakpoints of homology between BXO1 and BXO8. The distances of the break points from the stop
codons of the metB and etfA genes are indicated. Dashed lines indicate the remainder of the metB and etfA genes. The sequence
of the corresponding inverse repeats in Xac, Xcc and Xoor are also indicated along with the derived consensus sequence for
the repeats. The numbers in brackets indicate distances in bp between individual repeats.

from the first repeat on the metB side and 9 bp from the
first repeat on the etfA side. The distance between the second and third repeats is 4 bp in metB and etfA. We also
found similarly located inverse repeats in the metB and
etfA genes of Xac, Xcc and Xoor. A consensus sequence of
the repeats was derived (Fig. 4) by scoring a nucleotide if
it is present in a majority of repeats.
Relationship between BXO8 and Nepal 624 strains
The TAIL PCR results indicate that the BXO8 and
Nepal624 strains have identical sequences in place of the
BXO1 lps locus. As both the strains are from the Indian
subcontinent, there is the possibility that these are
identical/nearly identical to each other. We therefore performed DNA fingerprinting analysis of the BXO8 and
Nepal624 strains using the IS1112 insertion element as a
probe. This probe is highly informative and can clearly
differentiate the BXO1 and non BXO1 group of strains in
India [19]. The following strains were also included in the
analysis: BXO1, three non BXO1 group strains (BXO5,
BXO6, BXO20) and BXORI. The hybridisation pattern
revealed that BXO8 and Nepal624 are quite distinct from
each other (Fig. 5). We could score 42 unique bands and
the data generated were used to calculate pairwise similar-

ity coefficients and cluster analysis was performed to generate a dendrogram using UPGMA (please refer Methods).
The similarity coefficient between BXO8 and Nepal624 is
only 56%. The dendrogram (Fig. 6) indicates that BXO8
clusters with BXO#s 5, 6 and 20 at about the 58% similarity level while Nepal624 clusters with all these four strains
at about the 53% similarity level. All of the Xoo strains
cluster with each other at about the 51% similarity level.
Although the bootstrap values for these clusters are low, it
is clear that the BXO8 and Nepal624 strains are not closely
related to each other. As expected for an outgroup strain,
BXOR1 clusters with Xoo strains at the 29% similarity
level and the bootstrap value for this cluster is a high
96.8%.

Discussion
We report here the complete sequence and genomic
organization of the lps locus in the BXO1 strain of Xoo.
Three of the genes in this locus i.e., wxoA, wxoB and wxoC
were shown in an earlier study to be required for lipopolysaccharide production and virulence [8]. The predicted
proteins encoded by the three new genes i.e., wxoD, wzt
and wzm described in the present study are homologous
to functions involved in lipopolysaccharide modification

and transport. The wxoD gene encodes a predicted O-antigen acetylase which is homologous to similar functions
encoded in phage genomes and other bacteria. O-antigen
is the most variable part of LPS. Acetylation of O-antigen
is shown to confer resistance to anitimicrobial peptides in
Proteus mirabilis [28] and determines serotype in many
bacterial pathogens [29-31]. The other two genes, wzm
and wzt, are typically present in most lps gene clusters
[including those of Xac and Xcc][23] as tandem genes and
encode functions involved in LPS transport. The wzm and
wzt genes of BXO1 have overlapping ORFs, an arrangement that is also seen in wzm and wzt genes of the lps loci
in other bacteria including Xac. IS elements are frequently
found interrupting many lps loci [22] and in BXO1, three
IS elements interrupt the gene cluster between wxoD and
wzt genes.

The complete genome sequences of more than 150 bacteria are now available [32] and studies have revealed the
presence of DNA segments with G+C content and codon
usage different from the rest of the genome. These regions
are referred to as genomic islands and are believed to be
acquired by horizontal gene transfer [33,34]. Another
feature of genomic islands is their absence from the
genomes of closely related strains. Our study clearly indicates that the lps locus of Xoo strain BXO1 fulfils all of the
above criterion and constitutes a genomic island. The
G+C content of this lps locus, excluding the IS elements, is
50%. The transposases encoded by ISXo8 and IS1113 have
a G+C content that is >61%. This value, which is typical
for the genomes of Xoo and other xanthomonads [25],
suggests the possibility that these elements have transposed into the lps locus after it's transfer into the Xoo
genome. The presence of this genomic island in Xoo
strains that are distributed across a vast segment of the
Asian continent suggests that it was introduced into the
Xoo genome early in the evolution of this pathogen.
The BXO8 and Nepal624 strains do not have the lps locus
that is present in the other Xoo strains. The related xanthomonad, Xoor, also has an lps locus that is different
from the BXO1 lps locus. Also, different gene clusters are
present at this locus in Xac and Xcc (Fig. 7). This indicates
that multiple HGT events have occurred at this locus
among xanthomonads. One HGT event occurred early in
(or possibly at the time of) the evolution of the Xoo pathogen. This led to the introduction of the genomic island
described in Figure 1. Two separate HGT events are likely
to have occurred in the lineages that gave rise to BXO8 and
Nepal624 Xoo strains. This is inferred from the observation that BXO8 and Nepal624 are quite unrelated in their
genomic background. Another HGT can be inferred to
have occurred in the Xoor strain wherein sequences that
are most closely related to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato
have been introduced at one end of the lps cluster. At least
one more HGT has occurred to differentiate the lps gene
clusters in Xcc and Xac.
The presence of invert repeats in the regions that flank the
lps locus is likely to be significant. The presence of these
repeats in the metB and etfA genes is especially striking as
both genes encode completely different functions. The
location of the repeats flanking the Xoo lps locus suggests
that they might be involved in promoting recombination
during HGT and/or gene regulation. A short inverted
repeat sequence (GGCCAATCGA) flanking the
lipopolysaccharide gene cluster has been reported in
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis [35]. Another
conserved sequence, called JUMPstart has been found
located in intergenic regions upstream of polysaccharide
biosynthetic gene clusters in several animal pathogenic
bacteria like Escherichia coli strain K5, Vibrio cholera, etc.

Figure analysis of Xoo strains
Cluster 6
Cluster analysis of Xoo strains. The dendrogram was constructed using the UPGMA option of PHYLIP on the basis of
restriction fragment length polymorphism data obtained with IS1112 probe. Numbers or symbols at the internal branches indicate bootstrap values for clusters. The BXORI (Xoor) strain constitutes the outgroup.

This sequence was implicated to be involved in gene regulation and has also been suggested to have a role in
recombination [22,36].
As LPS is highly immunogenic, lps loci of animal pathogenic bacteria are under intense host selection and
extreme variation is reported in lps specific gene clusters
[22]. The observation that the two Xoo strains have different lps gene clusters suggests that the plant pathogenic
bacteria are also under selection to vary their LPS. Alterations in LPS composition might result in resistance
against predators like bacteriophages [4,10] or reduced
susceptibility to certain anti-microbial compounds [7] in
the host/environment. Most importantly, it might help in
evasion of the host defense response.

Conclusions
These results provide, for the first time, evidence for substantial variation in lps biosynthetic gene clusters within
different strains of a plant pathogenic bacterium. The
results also indicate that multiple HGT events have
occurred at this locus in various xanthomonads and provide a new parallel in the mechanisms that plant and animal pathogenic bacteria can employ to generate
variability in cell surface molecules.

kb fragments upon EcoRI (New England Biolabs [NEB],
Beverly, MA) digestion and all the fragments were subcloned in to pBlueScript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Most
of the sequence obtained in this study was generated by
sequencing the 9 kb subclone, pBP4, using a modified
shotgun sequencing procedure. Here, pBP4 was digested
with EcoRI and the 9 kb fragment was gel eluted. Then the
fragment was partially digested (1.5–2.5 kb) using a
blunt-end cutter, HaeIII (NEB) and cloned into pMOS
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire,
England). The inserts were amplified from random clones

by colony PCR using vector primers and were sequenced
using an ABI Prism 3700 automated DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After editing, the
assembly of the sequence data was done using GeneTools
(BioTools, Alberta, Canada) and Blast2 [27]. Multiple single strand sequences (3–8 X coverage) were generated for
each region in the sequence. Contig assembly was confirmed by restriction fragment analysis of a 12.5 kb PCR
amplified product containing the lps locus that was
obtained using long range PCR (Triple Master™, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with BXO1 genomic DNA as

template. The sizes of the fragments corresponded to the
sizes that are predicted by in silico analysis of the
sequence (data are not shown). The ORF's were assigned
using ORF finder [37] and genes were named as per Bacterial Polysaccharide Genes Nomenclature [20]. Two
primers, Pbp1 and Pbp2 (Table 2), were used to derive the
sequence of the 0.6 kb EcoRI fragment which is also a part
of the lps locus. The Pbp1 primer binds just after the wxoC
ORF (which forms part of the 3.5 kb EcoRI fragment) and
Pbp2 binds within the wxoD ORF (which forms part of the
9.0 kb EcoRI fragment). A 0.67 kb PCR amplified fragment
is obtained from BXO1 genomic DNA using Pbp1 and
Pbp2. The band was gel eluted and was sequenced using
Pbp1 and Pbp2. The sequence was found to include the
0.6 kb EcoRI fragment. In addition, the sequences of all six
ORFs were confirmed by sequencing of PCR amplified
fragments from genomic DNA using specific sets of gene
specific primers (see the list of primers in Table 2).
Codon Usage Pattern
For each gene the frequency of codon usage for different
aminoacids was calculated using a web based program
[38]. Further, eight aminoacids i.e., Glycine, Valine, Threonine, Leucine, Arginine, Serine, Proline and Alanine that
have atleast four synonymous codons were selected and
the percentage of synonymous codons that end with G or
C was calculated for each aminoacid and gene. The pattern was calculated for a group of genes by plotting mean
values ± SD corresponding to a particular aminoacid. The
first group was chosen to include genes that encode proteins which participate in diverse functions and are
present at different locations in the Xoo genome outside
the lps locus. These genes encode: a putative siderophore
receptor (AF325732), Xanthomonas adhesin like protein
(AF288222), a putative phytase (AY151260), rpfF
(AF411962), shikimate dehydrogenase (AF258797) and
secreted xylanase (AF331922). The second group
comprised the six genes (excluding transposases) encoded
in the Xoo lps gene cluster (AF337647).
Screening of Xoo strains and Xoor for the presence of the
genomic island
Specific oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed and
used to amplify gene specific fragments for each of the
ORFs encoded in the BXO1 genomic island (see the list of
primers given in Table 2). DNA sequencing was used to
confirm the authenticity of the PCR product obtained
with each primer pair using BXO1 genomic DNA as template. Southern hybridizations were performed using
these gene specific PCR products as probes. Genomic
DNA was isolated from Xoo and Xoor strains according to
the procedure described by Leach et. al. [16]. The DNA
was then digested with EcoRI (NEB) according to supplier's instructions. Digested genomic DNA was separated
on a 0.8% agarose gel and vacuum transferred to a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/40

Hybond N+ filter (Amersham) using 0.4% NaOH as
described by Sambrook et al. [39]. Probes were labelled
with α-32P dATP using random primer labelling kit (Board
of Radiation Technology, Mumbai, India). Prehybridization, hybridisation and washings were done at 68°C as
described by Yashitola et al [19]. Membranes were then
exposed to phoshoimager plates and images captured
using a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphoimager system (Fuji,
Japan).
To screen for the presence of the genomic island in different strains, a procedure for colony PCR was standardized.
A portion of a single colony (or 10λ of a saturated culture
that has approximately 1 × 109 colony forming units/ml)
was lysed in 100λ of 0.01 N NaOH by boiling for 10 minutes. After spinning at 13 K for 1 min., 2λ of supernatant
was used as template for PCR using the gene specific primers described above. The products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by
ethidium bromide staining.
TAIL-PCR and sequence analysis
Specific primers were designed against the conserved metB
and etfA gene sequences (Table 2) and the protocol for
TAIL-PCR was as originally described by Liu and Whittier
[26]. Sequencing of TAIL-PCR products was done using
either the cglL3 or etfL3 primer. Homology searches were
done using BLAST [21] through NCBI [40] and FASTA
[41] through EMBL-EBI [42]. BLAST2 [27] was used to
identify the homology break points in the genomic
regions that flank the lps locus of BXO1 and BXO8. The
sequences that were present upstream of the break points
were manually examined and three repeat sequences were
identified in the 3' coding regions of metB and etfA genes.
Similar repeat sequences were identified in the corresponding regions of BXO8, Nepal624, BXORI, Xac and
Xcc. A consensus was derived by aligning these repeat
sequences and a particular nucleotide was scored if it is
present in a majority of repeats.
DNA fingerprinting and data analysis
The Xoo IS element, IS1112 [16], was used as the hybridisation probe. This probe has been previously used to
detect genetic variability in Xoo strains from different
countries [15-19]. DNA isolation and Southern hybridisation was done as described in the section on screening of
Xoo and Xoor strains for the presence of genomic island.
The presence or absence of particular bands was scored as
1 or 0, respectively. The data were analysed using the Dice
coefficient option in the program WINDIST [43] to
generate distance matrices. The data were used to construct a dendrogram using the NEIGHBOR program in
PHYLIP (phylogeny inference software package; University of Washington, Seattle) using the UPGMA
(unweighted pair group method of averages) option. To

test the robustness of the dendrogram, bootstrap analysis
was carried out using the WinBoot program [43] with
2,000 iterations.
