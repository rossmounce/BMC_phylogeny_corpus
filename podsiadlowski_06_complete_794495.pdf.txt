Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial genomes form units of genetic information replicating indepentently
from nuclear genomes. Sequence data (most often from protein-coding genes) and other features
(gene order, RNA secondary structure) of mitochondrial genomes are often used in phylogenetic
studies of metazoan animals from population to phylum level. Pycnogonids are primarily marine
arthropods, often considered closely related to chelicerates (spiders, scorpions and allies).
However, due to their aberrant morphology and to controversial results from molecular studies,
their phylogenetic position is still under debate.
Results: This is the first report of a complete mitochondrial genome sequence from a sea spider
(Nymphon gracile, class Pycnogonida). Gene order derives from that of other arthropods so that
presumably 10 single tRNA gene translocations, a translocation of the mitochondrial control
region, and one large inversion affecting protein-coding genes must have happened in the lineage
leading to Nymphon gracile. Some of the changes in gene order seem not to be common to all
pycnogonids, as those were not found in a partial mitochondrial genome of another species, Endeis
spinosa. Four transfer RNAs of Nymphon gracile show derivations from the usual cloverleaf
secondary structure (truncation or loss of an arm). Initial phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial
protein-coding gene sequences placed Pycnogonida as sister group to Acari. However, this is in
contrast to the majority of all other studies using nuclear genes and/or morphology and was not
recovered in a second analysis where two long-branching acarid species were omitted.
Conclusion: Extensive gene rearrangement characterizes the mitochondrial genome of Nymphon
gracile. At least some of the events leading to this derived gene order happened after the split of
pycnogonid subtaxa. Nucleotide and amino acid frequencies show strong differences between
chelicerate taxa, presumably biasing phylogenetic analyses. Thus the affinities between Pycnogonida
and Acari (mites and ticks), as found in phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial genes, may rather
be due to long-branch attraction and independently derived nucleotide composition and amino acid
frequency, than to a real sister group relationship.

Background
Due to their evolutionary history as derived endosymbionts, mitochondria have retained genetic material – the
mitochondrial genome. Much of their original gene content was eliminated or transferred to the nucleus [1],
while only a small proportion of genes has persisted to the
present. In triploblastic animals the circular mitochondrial genome is sized around 11–20 kilobases and contains typically 37 genes: 13 protein-coding genes, two
ribosomal RNA genes and 22 transfer RNA genes [2].
Mitochondrial genomes serve as a simple model for
modes and mechanisms of gene rearrangements and
genome evolution and provide large datasets for phylogenetic analyses. The frequent use of mitochondrial genes
for inferring phylogenetic relationships of animals is due
to their universal distribution among taxa, strongly conserved regions in some genes (facilitating universal PCR
primer sets) and the absence of paralog genes [3]. However, the incidental presence of nuclear copies of mitochondrial genes [4] and strong differences in nucleotide
composition between taxa [5] may complicate phylogenetic analyses.
During the last ten years mitochondrial genome data have
played an important role in redefining arthropod relationships. The position of mitochondrial trnL2 is changed
in crustaceans and hexapods, but not in chelicerates and
myriapods [6]. Also from sequence-based analyses of
mitochondrial [7,8] and nuclear genes [9-11] the Pancrustacea hypothesis found strong support, while the traditional Tracheata hypothesis, mainly based on
morphological data, is now widely rejected. Mitochondrial genome data also provided strong evidence towards
the identification of the formerly enigmatic Pentastomida
(tongue worms) as aberrant crustaceans [12]. While those
hypotheses were collectively supported by nuclear and
mitochondrial data, some other hypotheses obtained
with mitochondrial genome data are highly disputed, as
for example the polyphyly of hexapods [7,8] or the phylogenetic position of pycnogonids [13].
Pycnogonids or sea spiders are among the most bizarre
arthropods, some of them with very large legs attached on
a tiny body. Food uptake is performed by a pharyngeal
suction tube, some species have even lost all head
appendages (chelifores and pedipalps). Due to their
derived morphology their phylogenetic position remains
uncertain, although most workers consider them as primarily aquatic chelicerates [14]. Recent phylogenetic analyses using a combination of molecular and
morphological data [11], or nuclear genes [9,10] support
a basal position among chelicerates. In contrast, sequence
data from partial mitochondrial genomes suggest an affin

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/284

ity to Acari (mites and ticks) [13], thus implying a terrestrial origin of pycnogonids. Recently, neuroanatomical
data suggest that pycnognid chelifores are not positionally
homologous to cheliceres [15], thus questioning pycnogonid affinities to Euchelicerata. However, hox gene
expression data do not support the this view [16]. We
report here the first complete mitochondrial genome
sequence for a member of the Pycnogonida,Nymphon gracile. We use these data to analyse chelicerate relationships
and to evaluate hypotheses of the phylogenetic position
of Pycnogonida. We also discuss ancestral and derived features of the mitochondrial genome of Nymphon gracile and
the influence of AT-content and differences of amino acid
frequencies on phylogenetic analyses.

Results and discussion
Mitochondrial genome organization
The mitochondrial genome of Nymphon gracile is a circular
DNA molecule of 14,681 bp length [GenBank:DQ666063]. All 37 genes expected for animal mitochondrial genomes have been identified. Gene overlaps
(7 bp) exist between nad4 and nad4L, as well as between
atp8 and atp6, as is reported for many other mitochondrial
genomes. Six out of thirteen protein-coding genes show
incomplete stop codons (T or TA), which is probably
compensated by posttranscriptional polyadenylation
[17].

Gene order (Fig. 1, Tab. 1) of the mitochondrial genome
differs in many positions from that of the horseshoe crab
Limulus polyphemus, which is considered to represent the
euarthropod ground pattern [18]. One large segment
(about 3,500 bp) containing the protein-coding genes
cox1, cox2, nad2 and the transfer RNA genes trnC, trnW,
trnI were probably subject to an inversion. Maintaining
their original gene order, these genes were found on the
opposite strand in Nymphon gracile compared to other
arthropods. Probably trnK and trnD were also involved in
the same inversion, meanwhile separated from cox2 by six
tRNA genes, which have different positions in other
arthropods. Further translocation events of single tRNA
genes may have led to their actual position in Nymphon
gracile. Three tRNAs were lost from the inverted segment
(trnQ, trnM, trnY) and translocated to other positions in
the mitochondrial genome. Two tRNA genes (trnE and
trnR) have interchanged their positions, making it impossible to decide which of them was translocated and which
stayed in its position. Supposing that trnK and trnD have
changed their position due to the large inversion mentioned above, altogether ten tRNA genes have undergone
individual translocation events. Except from those
involved in the inversion, no other protein-coding or
rRNA gene has changed its position compared to the

ground pattern of Euarthropoda, represented by Limulus
polyphemus [18]. The two trnL genes lie adjacent to another
between nad1 and rrnL, as expected for the euarthropod
ground pattern. This differs from the derived condition in
Hexapoda and Crustacea (trnL2 between cox1 and cox2,
trnL1 between nad1 and rrnL).
A large non-coding region is present between nad3-trnEtrnR and trnY-trnF-nad5. This is very likely to be the mitochondrial control region, which therefore must have been
translocated, too. As the strand bias of nucleotide frequencies is comparable to other arthropods (see below) the
control region seems not to be inverted as it is assumed for
scorpions and two web spider species [13].
A partial (5105 bp) mitochondrial genome of another
species of Pycnogonida, Endeis spinosa [GenBank:AY731173], was published recently [5,13] and
revealed no differences in gene order to Limulus
polyphemus in the segment ranging from nad2 to cox3.
Therefore we presume that the large inversion recorded in
Nymphon gracile must have happend after the split
between the two clades. Assuming a larger taxon sampling
the derived gene order of Nymphon gracile may serve as an
apomorphic character supporting a subtaxon of Pycnogonida. Six of the ten individually translocated tRNA genes
of Nymphon gracile found their new position between trnK
and cox2. In Endeis spinosa these two genes are adjacent,
therefore these six tRNA translocations may also have
happened after the split of the two clades.

Secondary structure of RNAs
Out of 22 transfer RNAs usually present in metazoan
mitochondrial genomes we have identified 18 by tRNAscan [19]. The remaining four show derivations from the
typical cloverleaf structure: the DHU stem and loop is
extremely short or missing in trnA, trnN and trnS1, while
it is definitely missing in trnR (putative secondary structures are shown in Fig. 2). Such aberrant secondary structures are often found in metazoan mitochondrial tRNAs,
some taxa even show derivations in the majority of their
tRNA genes (e.g. some nematodes [20], or web spiders
[21,22]). It is not clear if the function of such derived
tRNAs is maintained in every case, as there are reports of
recruitment of nuclear tRNAs into mitochondria [1]. In
spiders however, it is very likely that tRNAs are functional,
despite lacking the TΨC stem and loop [23]. trnS1 from
the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus is also missing the
complete DHU stem and loop, while all other tRNAs in
this species could be folded into cloverleaf structures [24].
Nucleotide composition
Nucleotide compositions of protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes clearly demonstrate a strand specific bias
(Tab. 2). CG-skew is positive for all genes on (+)-strand
and negative for genes on (-)-strand, AT-skew is positive
or only slightly negative in (+)-strand genes, while
strongly negative in (-)-strand genes. This is also true for
genes which have changed from one strand to the other
due to an inversion during pycnogonid evolution (cox1,
cox2, nad2). Strand bias in nucleotide composition is

probably due to asymmetries during the replication of
mitochondrial genomes, leading to different mutational
pressures on both strands. In the literature the exact mechanisms are controversially discussed: one strand stays single-stranded during replication in the stranddisplacement model [25], or is subject to extensive incorporation of ribonucleotides in the strand-coupled model
[26]. Almost all arthropods show this strand bias [5,13].
In some species a reversal is seen, probably due to a strand
swap of the mitochondrial control region (e.g. in scorpions and web spiders [5], as well as in an isopod [27]). As
seen from the pycnogonid and spider examples, strand
reversal of single genes leads to a quick reversal of strand
bias, too. In performing phylogenetic analyses one has to

take into account these findings and probably has to modify evolutionary models [5].
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences from all
mitochondrial protein-coding genes (Fig. 3) reveals a
strong support for a taxon comprised of Nymphon gracile
and Acari (mites and ticks) from BI but not from ML bootstrap analysis. Similar results were published based on an
analysis of five mitochondrial protein-coding genes [13].
This contradicts almost every other phylogenetic study
which included pycnogonids (the only recent exception
not based on mitochondrial genes is a combined analysis
of 18S/28S sequences and morphological data, including

fossils [28], where Pycnogonida, Acari and Palpigradi
together form one clade – but with extreme character conflict). Recent multigene analyses place pycnogonids outside Arachnida: either (1) as sister group to Euchelicerata
(Xiphosura + Arachnida), e.g. with a combined alignment
of EF-1α, EF-2, and RNA-Pol II [10], as well as with a combined dataset of nine genes and morphology [11]; or (2)
in an unresolved trichotomy with Euchelicerata and Myriapoda (together forming the clade Paradoxopoda or
Myriochelata), e.g. using a combined aligment of 18S and
28S [9].
As a consequence of an Acari-Pycnogonid clade one
would have to assume that pycnogonids may either have
had terrestrial ancestors, or that an independent transition
to terrestrial life was undertaken by Acari on the one hand,
and spiders and scorpions on the other hand (leaving the
question open where to place the remaining arachnid
taxa). At least the first hypothesis is contradicted by the
fossil record: the oldest pycnogonid fossil is from the
upper Cambrian, a time from which no terrestrial animal
is known [29] – the first terrestrial arachnids were not
found before the Silurian – a gap of about 70 million
years.
To determine effects of long-branch attraction [30], a second analysis was performed, on a dataset where sequences
from the long-branching acarids Varroa destructor and Leptotrombidium pallidum were omitted (Fig. 4). In the resulting tree Pycnogonida does not cluster with Acari, rather
appears as sister taxon to Euchelicerata in the ML tree, but
without good support from BI or ML bootstrap analysis.

Chelicerata, Euchelicerata and Arachnida as well find no
good support from these inferences. So it is very likely that
long-branch attraction is one major reason for the clustering of Pycnogonida and Acari in phylogenetic analysis of
chelicerate relationships with mitochondrial genes, while
the true position of Pycnogonida remains far from being
resolved by our analyses.
AT content and amino acid usage in chelicerate
mitochondrial genomes
As mentioned above, some of the arachnid taxa show a
reversal in nucleotide frequency bias (the scorpion Centruroides limpidus, the spiders Ornithoctonus huwena and Habronattus oregonensis, and the mite Varroa jacobsohni), which
may be one reason for misleading results in a phylogenetic analysis [5,13]. However, it was shown before that a
reversal in strand bias seems not to be the cause for the
affinity between Acari and Pycnogonida [13].

With the exception of Limulus polyphemus all chelicerates
in our phylogenetic analysis show branch lengths two or
three times longer than those of hexapods, crustaceans
and myriapods (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). This implies that arachnid
and pycnogonid species have undergone more change in
nucleotide sequence than Limulus polyphemus and the
remainder of arthropod taxa in our study. With the exception of the scorpion Centruroides limpidus all arachnid and
pycnogonid species in our study show a higher AT content
in protein-coding genes than Limulus polyphemus and the
outgroup taxa (Tab. 3). This is more striking if only third
codon positions are compared. Strong variation in AT
content between species may also lead to perturbance of

Bold numbers indicate strong differences (+/-25%) to Limulus polyphemus (underlined). This species was chosen for comparison, because in the phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3, 4) it shows a branch length
comparable to those of crustacean, myriapod and hexapod species, while the remainder of chelicerates was subject to a higher degree of nucleotide substitution. See methods for complete names of species.

Table 3: Amino acid usage and AT content of mitochondrial protein-coding genes from various arthropods.

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:284

phylogenetic analyses [31]. Independent evolution of
higher AT content my lead to homoplastic similarities.
Looking at the amino acid composition of the proteincoding genes from chelicerates and other arthropods
(Tab. 3), again strong differences are observed between
Limulus polyphemus and the remainder of Chelicerata.
Compared to mitochondrial proteins from Limulus
polyphemus some amino acids are significantly less used in
the pycnogonid species and most of the arachnids (Ala,
Arg, Cys, Gln, Thr, Trp), while others are significantly
more frequently used (Lys, Met). With a few exceptions,
less used amino acids are coded by GC rich codons (Ala,
Arg, Gly, Pro), while those more often used are coded by
AT rich codons (Ile, Lys, Met, Phe, Asn). A similar effect is
seen in a comparison of codon usage for the amino acids
leucine and serine (Tab. 4). For the coding of leucine,
UUR-codons are more frequently used in all chelicerate
taxa than CUN-codons, but the difference is by far higher
in those taxa, which show the highest AT-contents (The
acarid taxa Haemaphysalis flava, Amblyomma triguttatum,
Varroa destructor, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and the pycnogonid Nymphon gracile). In contrast AGN-codons and
UCN-codons for serine show only moderate variance
between the taxa.
Thus the noticed derivations in amino acid usage seem to
be directly linked to AT-content: the higher the proportion
of adenine and thymine, the stronger the differences in
amino acid usage. And in fact, for some amino acids Nymphon gracile together with some Acari (the taxa showing
the highest AT contents as mentioned above) show the
strongest differences to Limulus polyphemus (Ala, Gly, Phe,
Trp). This fact may have further promoted the clustering
of Acari and Nymphon gracile in our first phylogenetic
analysis (Fig. 3) and in [13]. In contrast, a web spider
(Habronattus oregonensis) which also shows high AT content does not cluster with Acari and Nymphon gracile, probably due to a balancing effect of the other two web spider
species, which show a comparably moderate AT content.

Conclusion
Ten individually translocated tRNA genes, a large inversion of a segment covering three protein-coding genes and
five tRNA genes, and translocation of the control region
lead to a derived gene order in Nymphon gracile compared
to other arthropods, including another species of Pycnogonida (Endeis spinosa). If sequence data from more pycnogonid species becomes available, gene translocations
may serve as phylogenetic markers, which probably
resolve relationships between pycnogonid subtaxa. Phylogenetic analysis of chelicerate relationships using mitochondrial protein-coding genes supported a clade
consisting of Pycnogonida and Acari. These results contradict other analyses performed with nuclear genes or mor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/284

phological characters. Omiting some of the longbranching acarid species from the analysis led to a tree
with unresolved relationships between Myriapoda, Pycnogonida, Xiphosura and two arachnid clades. We
hypothesize that phylogenetic analyses of chelicerate
interrelationships based on mitochondrial protein-coding
genes is biased by three misleading factors: (a) longbranch attraction, (b) derived AT bias in all chelicerate
taxa except Limulus polyphemus, and (c) reversed strand
bias in Scorpiones, two species of Araneae and the mite
Varroa destructor. Thus from a mitogenomic point of view
the exact phylogenetic position of Pycnogonida remains
an open question, but a sister group relationship between
Acari and Pycnogonida as suggested by Hassanin [13] is
rather caused by long-branch attraction and higher AT
content than to an underlying phylogenetic signal.

Methods
Samples and DNA extraction
Specimens of Nymphon gracile were sampled at Concarneau (France) and immediately preserved in pure ethanol
(99.8%). DNA from the legs of a single specimen was
extracted using the DNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturers protocol.
PCR, sequencing and gene annotation
Fragments of six mitochondrial genes (cox1, nad4, nad5,
rrnl, rrns) were PCR amplified using primers especially
designed for this purpose. Primer sequences were as follows: cox1f: 5'-ACTAATCACA ARGAYATTGG-3'/cox1r: 5'TAGTCTGAGT ANCGTCGWGG-3' (annealing temperature: 45°C); nad4f: 5'-TTGAGGTTAY CAGCCYG-3'/
nad4r: 5'-ATATGAGCYA CAGAAGARTA AGC-3' (45°C);
nad5f: 5'-AGAATTCACT AGGDTGRGAT GG-3'/nad5r: 5'AAAGAGCCTT AAATAAAGCA TG-3' (45°C); 16Sf: 5'GCGACCTCGA TGTTGGATTA A-3'/16Sr: 5'-CCGGTCTGAA CTCAYATC-3' (48°C); 12Sf: 5'-CAGCAKYCGC
GGTTAKAC-3'/12Sr: 5'-ACACCTACTW TGTTACGACT
TATCTC-3' (52°C). Primer design was performed on conserved regions of alignments using mitochondrial genes
of various arthropod species [32]. All PCR experiments
were done on Mastercycler and Mastercycler gradient
(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using the HotMasterTaq Kit (Eppendorf). PCR reaction volumes were 50 µl
(42 µl sterilized destilled water, 5 µl 10× reaction buffer
1µl dNTP mix, 1 µl primer mix (10 µM each), 1 µl DNA
template, 0,2 µl = 1 u HotMasterTaq polymerase). Cycling
protocol includes an initial denaturation step for 2 min at
94°C, 40 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 1 min at the appropriate annealing temperature (see above) and 90 sec at 68°C;
in the end a final extension step for 1 min at 68°C. PCR
products were gel purified (Qiaquick Gel purification kit,
Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subsequently used for
sequencing. Sequencing reactions were done using the
DCTS quick start kit (Beckman-Coulter) and the CEQ

8000 capillary sequencer (Beckman-Coulter). Sequence
information from these PCR fragments was used to design
PCR primer pairs to amplify missing parts between them.
The PCR protocol described above was therefore modified
with extension steps of 7 min, and a final extension step
of 3 min.
Successful amplification of PCR products was obtained
with the following primer pairs (annealing temperature
and approximate length in brackets): Ng-12sr: 5'-AAAAAGAATA CTAGGGTCTC TAATC C-3'/Ng-cox1f: 5'- AGCGGGTTTT ACTAATTGGT ATCC-3' (54°C, 2000 bp); Ngcox1r: 5'- AAGAAGTTAC TAACAATATT AAAGCAGGAG
G-3'/Ng-nad5f: 5'-TTTAACTATA TTCTTAGCTA GAGTATGTGC TTC-3' (58°C, 5000 bp); Ng-nad5r: 5'-ATAAAACATA AACCCCAGCA G-3'/Ng-nad4f: 5'-GATTATAGGT
TGAGGAAAAT CTC-3' (49°C, 1700 bp); Ng-16sr: 5'CGGTCTGAAC TCAGATCATG TAA-3'/Ng-12sf: 5'TTAAAGGATA AGATGGGCTA C-3' (48°C, 1500 bp). In
addition for amplification of the part spanning from nad4
to rrnl a primer pair already published in [33] was used
successfully used: N4: 5'-GGAGCTTCAA CATGAGCTTT3'/16S2: 5'-GCGACCTCGA TGTTGGATTA A-3' (50°C,
3900 bp). Sequencing of PCR products larger than 1000
bp was done using a primer walking strategy.
Primary analysis of nucleotide sequences was done using
the Beckman CEQ 8000 software. Sequences were then
aligned and assembled using Bioedit [34]. Protein-coding
genes and ribosomal RNA genes were identified by blast-

ing on NCBI entrez databases and by comparison with
other arthropod mitochondrial genomes. Transfer RNA
genes were identified using tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [19] and
DOGMA [35].
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using nucleotide
sequences from mitchondrial protein-coding genes.
Amino acid sequences from single genes were aligned by
Clustal X [36] with default settings. After retranslation to
nucleotides, ambigously aligned parts were omitted from
the analysis by making use of Gblocks 0.91b [37], using
the "codons" option and default block parameters. Due to
the results of a saturation analysis [38] on single codon
positions, implemented in DAMBE, version 4.2.13 [39],
third codon positions were eliminated from the alignment. The final alignment consisted of 5,711 bp for 20
taxa. A second alignment was obtained by the same procedure but omitting the two species of Acari with longest
branches (Varroa destructor and Leptotrombidium pallidum),
leading to an alignment consisting of 5,996 bp for 18 taxa.

Two different analyses were performed on both alignments. (1) A maximum likelihood tree was computed
using PAUP* ver. 4.0b10 [40]. The model
(GTR+I+gamma) and model parameters were chosen
according to the AIC with modeltest 3.7 [41]. In addition
100 bootstrap replicates were performed. (2) Bayesian
analysis was performed with MrBayes 3.1.2 [42].
1,000,000 generations were run under the GTR model,

sites. The first 100 out of 1000 trees were discarded as
burn-in. Mitochondrial genome data from other species
