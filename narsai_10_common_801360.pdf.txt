Common and distinct organ and stress responsive
transcriptomic patterns in Oryza sativa and
Arabidopsis thaliana
Reena Narsai1,2, Ian Castleden1,2, James Whelan1,2*

Abstract
Background: Arabidopsis thaliana is clearly established as the model plant species. Given the ever-growing
demand for food, there is a need to translate the knowledge learned in Arabidopsis to agronomically important
species, such as rice (Oryza sativa). To gain a comparative insight into the similarities and differences into how
organs are built and how plants respond to stress, the transcriptomes of Arabidopsis and rice were compared at
the level of gene orthology and functional categorisation.
Results: Organ specific transcripts in rice and Arabidopsis display less overlap in terms of gene orthology
compared to the orthology observed between both genomes. Although greater overlap in terms of functional
classification was observed between root specific transcripts in rice and Arabidopsis, this did not extend to flower,
leaf or seed specific transcripts. In contrast, the overall abiotic stress response transcriptome displayed a
significantly greater overlap in terms of gene orthology compared to the orthology observed between both
genomes. However, ~50% or less of these orthologues responded in a similar manner in both species. In fact,
under cold and heat treatments as many or more orthologous genes responded in an opposite manner or were
unchanged in one species compared to the other. Examples of transcripts that responded oppositely include
several genes encoding proteins involved in stress and redox responses and non-symbiotic hemoglobins that play
central roles in stress signalling pathways. The differences observed in the abiotic transcriptomes were mirrored in
the presence of cis-acting regulatory elements in the promoter regions of stress responsive genes and the
transcription factors that potentially bind these regulatory elements. Thus, both the abiotic transcriptome and its
regulation differ between rice and Arabidopsis.
Conclusions: These results reveal significant divergence between Arabidopsis and rice, in terms of the abiotic
stress response and its regulation. Both plants are shown to employ unique combinations of genes to achieve
growth and stress responses. Comparison of these networks provides a more rational approach to translational
studies that is based on the response observed in these two diverse plant models.

Background
Arabidopsis thaliana is clearly established as the preeminent model plant species [1,2]. A major challenge in
plant biology research is to translate the knowledge
learned in Arabidopsis to agronomically important species in an attempt to address the growing demand for
food to feed the 9 billion people by 2050, requiring an
increase of 70% in food production [3,4]. The application

of various genomic approaches directly to crop species,
such as observed with the sequencing of the maize genome [5], and the power of the new generation of sequencing technologies means that genomic wide studies on
crop species are now feasible [6]. The use of marker
assisted selection (MAS) and mapped based cloning
(MBC) have also been successfully applied in a variety of
cereal plants to produce field varieties with desired traits
[4,7,8]. However, despite the application of these technologies and methodologies, it does not nearly match the
knowledge directly obtained from model species. Additionally, the high co-linearity that exists between cereal

genomes allows comparative genomic approaches to be
used, so that genes identified in one cereal or wild-type
relatives can be quickly identified and selected in crop
and/or other cereal species [8]. However, it is important
to note that these approaches are component based and
thus fail to take into account how different components
can interact in a system.
It is obvious to state that the genome is the same in
all cells in an individual but yet can produce different
‘phenotypes’ due to differentiation and development.
The combinatorial regulation of gene expression has the
potential to produce almost endless combinations of
novel solutions to challenges in the environment. There
are many examples in evolution where the same phenotype can be achieved via different mechanisms [9], such
as bract suppression in monocots and dicots [10]. Similar outcomes or traits can be achieved using different
approaches, a good example of this is the evolution of
C4 photosynthesis in plants, that has arisen independently many times in angiosperm plants [11]. Transcriptional networks change rapidly with respect to
evolutionary time, binding sites for transcription factors
can be changed in a small number of mutations that
can alter a transcriptional network [12]. Organisms closely related in evolutionary terms can have different
motifs to regulate similar sets of genes due to the fact
that different environments select different combinatorial networks that are required to regulate genes in each
environment [12]. Comparative systems biology scale
approaches reveal that changes in phenotype are often a
result of small changes in the way components interact
or that similar biological outcomes can be achieved by
networks of different components [13].
Transcriptional networks are the dynamic expression of
the gene complement of an organism. As polyploidisation
is a major speciation mechanism in plants this has the
potential to cause large-scale changes in the gene complement. In particular it seems that genes encoding regulatory factors, e.g. transcription factors, are preferentially
retained after duplication events and the divergence of
these regulatory factors plays a role in diversification in
flowering plants [14]. This diversification of regulatory
factors has the potential to results in large scale rearrangements in transcriptome signatures, and many studies carried out at the level of specific gene families reveal
species specific functions. An analysis of both lectin and
lignin biosynthesis genes between Arabidopsis and rice
concluded that lineage-specific expansion has occurred
that would result in species-specific traits [15,16]. Likewise, at the level of signalling, genes involved in controlling flowering time [17] and genes encoding F-Box protein
involved in substrate-recognition for ubiquitin ligases [18]
have diverged. Similarly, at the transcriptional level, analysis of transcription factor families, such as the NAC and

Page 2 of 25

bHLH families across various plant species has revealed
species specific activities of these, ranging from developmental to stress responses [19,20]. Given that genome
duplication, chromosomal duplication and differential loss
of duplicated genes has resulted in a relatively rapid evolution of plant genomes, ~140 million years of divergence
between monocots and eudicots, compared to hundreds of
millions of years of conservation between vertebrate genomes, this has resulted in different sets of genes that form
the base of transcriptional networks in plants [11].
In order to gain an overview of how transcriptional networks vary between plants, an analysis of transcriptome
profiles for similar data sets in rice and Arabidopsis was
carried out with the view to investigate the level of similarly in transcriptional networks across organs and in
response to abiotic stress. This would provide a genome
wide overview, rather than a family-by-family comparison,
of how plants grow and respond to the environment.
Although Arabidopsis and rice represent a wide phylogenetic gap of ~140 million years in plant evolution [21],
common responses are likely to be conserved across many
plant species, while distinct responses are a signpost to
where divergence has occurred [22]. Both provide insight
into how organs are formed and grow, and how plants
respond to the environment. These analyses will provide a
useful resource for examining how similar outcomes can
be achieved using different combinations of genes. These
findings will provide a more rational approach to choosing
candidates for translational research between species,
where successes in achieving outcomes are often reported
[23], yet the failure rate is unknown.

Results
Global analysis of transcriptome datasets

Although a variety of array platforms are used for transcriptome analysis in rice [24-26], the broadest collection
of datasets is available on the Affymetrix platform. This
is advantageous as it is the same platform as used for the
Arabidopsis AtGenExpress project, so all parameters for
parallel array comparisons could be identical with respect
to statistical analysis. In addition, the range of experiments in rice is now also large, with organ, development,
abiotic (heat, cold, drought salt), biotic (fungal, bacterial,
viral) and hormone treatment experimental designs available. Although Arabidopsis is the pre-eminent plant
model, rice is a close second. Arabidopsis is a eudicot
and thus is separated by ~ 140 million years from monocot plants [21]. The major cereal crops Triticum, Hordeum, Oryza, Sorghum, and Zea are all monocot plants
that supply over half of the calorific needs of the world
population [27]. Given this demand, these cereals are
grown all over the world and are therefore subject to
vastly differential environmental conditions. Thus,
a comparison between Arabidopsis, the most widely

studied plant model, and rice, the model cereal, can provide information that may be beneficial to the major food
producing crop plants.
To carry out multi-array expression analysis for rice,
normalised data from all 366 rice microarrays, representing 129 biological samples, were collated together
and a probeset was considered to be expressed in a particular tissue/sample if at least 2 replicates for that sample showed statistically significant present calls (p <
0.05) [28]. The number of genes called present in this
way followed the same distribution pattern as was
expected with a large number of probesets seen at each
tail of the distribution (Additional file 1, Figure S1) [29].
The microarray experiments included in these analyses
are outlined in Table 1 (Additional file 2, Table S1).
More than 41,000 unique probesets were expressed
across one or more of the samples, with an average of
~24,000 probesets expressed per sample. Analysis of the
129-sample expression data matrix revealed differences
in the global expression pattern across all the rice
microarrays (Figure 1). In order to compare this to Arabidopsis, all rice probesets with TIGR identifiers were
matched to Arabidopsis orthologues and the proportion
of these with Arabidopsis orthologues are indicated by
the darker shade of colour for each subset (Figure 1). It
can be seen that only 37% of rice genes represented on
the microarray had Arabidopsis orthologues (based on
the Inparanoid Orthologue Database [30]). In contrast,
reverse comparison revealed that 61% of all Arabidopsis
genes had rice orthologues, indicating that a much larger proportion of non-orthologous genes exist in rice
compared to Arabidopsis.
This analysis of rice global expression (based on microarrays) revealed that 26% of all probesets were never
expressed, 16% were expressed in all samples (constitutively expressed), 5% were expressed exclusively in only
1 sample (showed specific expression) and 53% were
expressed in between 2 to 128 samples (non-specifically
expressed) (Figure 1A). In order to determine if there
was a relationship between rice gene expression and
gene orthology, it was determined how many genes in
each subset had existing Arabidopsis orthologues and
this was compared the genome percentage (37% of rice
genes in the genome have Arabidopsis orthologues; Figure 1B). Notably, for the genes in each of these sub-sets,
significant differences in the proportion of Arabidopsis
orthologues were noted compared to the genome (Figure 1B). It could be seen that the genes which were
never expressed and those showing specific expression
had significantly lower proportions (z-score, p < 0.01) of
Arabidopsis orthologues than the genome (8% and 20%
respectively, compared to 37% in the genome; Figure
1B). In contrast, significantly higher proportions
(z-score, p < 0.01) of genes that showed constitutive

Page 3 of 25

expression and those showing non-specific expression
had orthologues in Arabidopsis (75% and 40%, respectively compared to the genome), implying a more conserved requirement for the expression of these genes in
both species.
A Functional Catalogue (FUNCAT) analysis of the
transcripts in each subset (Always, Never, Specific and
Non-specific) was carried out based on predicted protein function (Figure 1C). The results reveal statistically
significant (p < 0.01) differences in the representation of
functional catalogues within each subset (Figure 1C,
Additional file 2, Table S2). The subset of probesets that
were never expressed were found to be significantly
enriched in transcripts encoding replication and repair
functions as well as environmental information processing/cellular processes (Figure 1C). It is important to
note this subset is likely to include transcripts which are
too low to be detected by microarray studies, thus this
“never expressed” refers strictly to microarrays and it is
likely that a large number of these transcripts are
expressed and could possibly be detected by quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), which is known to be sensitive
enough to detect low abundance transcripts such as
transcription factors [31]. Nonetheless, it is interesting
to note that this group was also significantly depleted in
transcripts encoding proteins involved in core cellular
functions such as translation functions (Figure 1C). This
finding is complemented by finding in the “constitutively
expressed” subset, which was significantly enriched (p <
0.01) in amino acid metabolism, transcription, translation, folding, sorting and degradation and cellular processes (Figure 1). Together, these findings suggest that
transcripts encoding proteins necessary in any cell, such
as those encoding transcription and translation functions, are consistently required, regardless of cell type or
stress and thus appear to be expressed in all tissues at a
high enough level to be detected by microarrays. This is
also supported by the finding that more than double the
proportion (76%) of genes that were constitutively
expressed had orthologues in Arabidopsis (Figure 1B).
Overall, these finding suggests that the fundamental
processes of transcription, translation and protein folding would be expected to be well conserved between
Arabidopsis and rice.
Tissue/Development specific transcriptomic signatures in
Arabidopsis and rice

Having established the basic transcriptome pattern of
rice, a direct comparison to analogous datasets in Arabidopsis was possible. Firstly, the organ specific transcriptome for seed, leaf, root and flower was defined for rice
and Arabidopsis by analysis of the microarrays were that
were carried out using these organ types (Table 1; Additional file 2, Table S3). The same criteria were used to

was defined as leaf specific. The number of root specific

probesets expressed in Arabidopsis (392) was found to

Figure 1 Global expression analysis of rice transcriptome datasets. A) Expression of the 57,302 probesets defined as the genome were
classified as always expressed, never expressed, showing specific expression or non-specific expression based on MAS5.0 normalised microarray
data. A probeset was considered to be expressed if it was called present in >/= 2 replicates in at least one sample. B) The proportion of rice
transcripts that have Arabidopsis orthologues (determined by Inparanoid database v7.0) is indicated by the darker shade of colour for each
subset. Significant (z-score, p < 0.01) enrichment/depletion of orthologues in each sub-set compared to the genome proportion is denoted with
a red/blue ^, respectively. B) Analysis of FUNcational CATalogue (FUNCAT) was carried out on each set of genes. Subsets that were enriched or
depleted in that FUNCAT compared to the genome are indicated by the red or blue asterisk respectively.

similar sets of genes were observed to be root specific in
Arabidopsis and rice, this implies that the larger gene
content of rice compared to Arabidopsis (50,000
(TIGR6) verse 35,000 (TIGR8) respectively) has undergone sub-functionalisation and thus, there are more
genes that display specific expression patterns in rice.
To gain insight into this, all rice genes (with TIGR
identifiers) and all Arabidopsis genes (with AGIs) were
compared. Firstly, the number of genes showing organ
specific expression was determined (e.g. 1017 flower
specific genes in rice) and the number of existing orthologues within these sets were calculated and shown
within the inner darker block within each set, e.g. 211
of the 1017 flower specific genes in rice had Arabidopsis
orthologues, but only 6 were both orthologous and
showing the flower specific response in (Figure 2B).

Interestingly, it was seen that for all genes showing specific expression in each of the 4 tissues analysed in both
species, there was a significantly smaller (p < 0.01) proportion of orthologues present in each of these sets
compared to the proportions in the respective genomes
(Figure 2B). In addition, of the 502 rice lineage specific
genes [32] expressed on the rice microarray (making up
1.4% of the genome), a significantly larger proportion of
these were present in the flower specific set (p < 0.01)
and seed specific set (p < 0.02) in rice (26 genes; 2.5%
and 19 genes; 2.2% respectively compared to 1.4% in the
genome; Figure 2B). Similarly, a significant over-representation of Arabidopsis lineage specific genes was
observed in the root specific set (6 genes; 1.6% vs. 0.4%
in the genome; Figure 2B). Analysis of the orthologous
genes that displayed tissue specific expression between

Figure 2 Summary of transcripts that display development or tissue specific detection. A) For each tissue and/or developmental stage
(seed, leaf root and flower) the number of probesets expressed exclusively in one or more of the developmental stages for that tissue is shown
e.g. present at one or more stage of inflorescence. The numbers in brackets indicates the number of probesets with known TIGR6 identifiers for
rice or known TAIR9 AGIs for Arabidopsis. B) For each of the tissues, the probesets with annotated TIGR identifiers or AGIs for rice and
Arabidopsis respectively, were analysed for orthologues that displayed the same type of restricted expression profile. Orthologues were
determined based on the Inparanoid database v7.0 [30]. Overlap in the Venn diagram indicates the number of genes that were orthologous and
tissue specific in both species e.g. 5 orthologous, flower specific genes. The number in the darker shades represent the number of orthologues
that exist, but are not tissue specific in the respective other species. Lastly, the number in the lightest shade represents the number of genes
that have no orthologues, with the number of lineage specific genes shown in the black circle (lineage specific was defined in [32]). C) The AGI,
TIGR identifiers and description of each gene in the overlapping sets are also shown. D) PageMan analysis of the genes showing tissue specific
expression. For each set of genes that showed tissue specific expression (e.g. all 231 leaf specific genes for rice), statistical analysis of overrepresented functional categories was carried out using the Fisher method. Functional categories that did not show significant changes were
collapsed for display. Statistical significances are represented by a false colour heat map (up, red; down, blue) where a z-score of 1.96 represents
a p-value of 0.05.

both species indicated all five flower specific genes were
involved in male gametophyte production, viability or
pollen tube growth (Figure 2C). In the case of seed specific genes, genes encoding endomembrane proteins
were dominant, whilst genes involved in cell wall growth
were prominent in the root specific set (Figure 2C).
While the overlap between the organ specific genes
was low in terms of gene orthology, it may be argued
that direct orthology is too strict to reveal similar processes and that the organ specific genes in both species
may be more similar if defined in terms of function.
Thus, all tissue specific genes (regardless of orthology)
were analysed based on the over/under-representation
of functional categories using the PageMan software
[33] (Figure 2D). In this comparison, greater similarities
were seen for the over/under-representation of functional categories for some organs, such as roots, where
many root specific transcripts were enriched in the
same functional groups in both Arabidopsis and rice
(green shade, Figure 2D). However, even in root, certain
processes/functions showed differences in enrichment,
such as for ‘cell’ and ‘RNA’ functions (orange shade, Figure 2D). In contrast, with the exception of ‘protein’
related functions, there was little overlap in the functional representation across Arabidopsis and rice for
flower and seed specific gene sets (Figure 2D). Similarly,
little functional overlap was seen between the Arabidopsis and rice leaf specific sets, with opposite over/underrepresentation even observed for genes encoding protein
related functions (Figure 2D).
Transcriptomic responses under abiotic stress for rice and
Arabidopsis

Analysis of the abiotic transcriptomes of Arabidopsis
and rice in parallel enabled the identification of similarities and differences in the response to abiotic stress
(Table 1). For the drought and salt responsive subsets,
the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in
rice was much greater than in Arabidopsis, with over
~12,000 DEGs in rice compared to ~4,000 in Arabidopsis (Figure 3; Additional file 2, Table S4 and S5). In contrast, the number of DEGs following the cold and heat
treatments was more comparable with 9,792 and 7, 257
genes differentially expressed in rice compared to 9, 032
and 5, 458 in Arabidopsis, respectively (Figure 3). These
subsets of DEGs were then analysed to determine the
proportion of genes that were known to have Arabidopsis/rice orthologues. It was observed that over 70% of
Arabidopsis genes and over 55% of the rice genes in
each differentially expressed subset have orthologues in
rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, which is significantly
(p < 0.01) larger than the proportion of orthologues in
the genomes (61% and 37%, respectively) (Figure 2B and
Figure 3). However, only 10%-14% of all rice DEGs in

Page 7 of 25

the drought and salt responsive subsets had orthologues
in Arabidopsis that also responded the same way. For
example, the 811 genes that were both orthologous and
down regulated under drought, represents ~10% of all
the rice genes down-regulated following drought stress
(all = 8488; Figure 3A; Additional file 2, Table S6).
Whilst, these 811 orthologous Arabidopsis genes make
up 44% of all the Arabidopsis genes down-regulated following drought stress (all = 1864; Figure 3). Notably,
the largest conservation of down-regulated genes were
observed for the drought and salt responsive sub-sets,
with >40% of Arabidopsis genes showing the same regulation in the respective rice orthologues (Figure 3). In
contrast, for the heat and cold responsive sub-sets,
<25% of orthologous genes showed a common transcript
response between rice and Arabidopsis, despite >60% of
the genes in these sub-sets having orthologues in both
species.
While examining similarities in the transcriptomic
responses between orthologous genes in rice and Arabidopsis, it was observed that some orthologues were
responsive in an opposite manner between both species.
To determine the extent of this contrasting response,
the entire set of rice transcripts significantly up-regulated in each of the abiotic stresses was overlapped with
the corresponding Arabidopsis transcripts that were
significantly down-regulated for that stress and vice
versa (Additional file 1, Figure S2). A small percentage
(5%-7%) of rice transcripts that changed in abundance
under drought and salt treatment had respective Arabidopsis orthologues that were responsive in an opposite
manner (opposite response in R & A; Figure 3). In contrast, an equal or greater percentage of orthologous rice
and Arabidopsis genes were found to be responding in
an opposite manner in the cold and heat responsive
subsets (Figure 3). For example, of the 3062 transcripts
up-regulated under cold stress in rice, only 10% had
Arabidopsis orthologues that were also up-regulated
under cold stress (301; Figure 3), whilst 13% of this upregulated set (3062) had respective Arabidopsis orthologues that were down-regulated (413; Figure 3). Similarly,
under heat stress, the percentage of orthologous genes
that were oppositely responding was comparable or
greater than the percentage of DEGs that had a common response (Figure 3). For example, the 866 genes
that were orthologous and up-regulated genes in both
rice and Arabidopsis under heat stress, was smaller than
the 969 rice genes that were up-regulated in rice, whilst
their Arabidopsis orthologues were down-regulated in
response to heat (Figure 3).
In order to examine the overall similarities/differences
in the transcriptomic responses (in an orthology independent manner) between Arabidopsis and rice, a comparison of the functions of the DEGs was carried out

using the functional over-representation analysis in
the Pageman software [33]. This revealed that for some
categories such as ‘protein’ and ‘signalling’, and to a
lesser extent ‘hormone metabolism’, the over/underrepresentation patterns of these functional categories
were similar (Figure 4, green shade). However, considerable differences in the representation of some functional
categories were also evident. This was particularly seen
for the genes responding to heat, where the opposite

over/under-representation of specific functional categories was observed (Figure 4, orange shading). Specifically, differences in the over/under-representation of
‘cell wall, amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolism
and RNA functions’ were observed in response to heat.
Notably for the category of redox functions, it was seen
that the abiotic stress responsive subsets in rice often
appeared to be over-represented in these functions,
whilst this over-representation was not always seen in

Figure 4 Pageman analysis of microarray data in response to
abiotic stress. For each abiotic stress experiment in rice and
Arabidopsis, the significant fold-changes for the entire set of
differentially expressed genes were analysed using the PageMan
tool. Statistical analysis of over-represented functional categories
was carried out using the Fisher method. Functional categories that
did not show significant changes were collapsed for display.

Arabidopsis. Additionally, for many other comparisons it
was observed that Arabidopsis and rice differed in terms
of functional representation as a simple comparison of
the two columns in each black box displayed more differences than similarities (Figure 4).
In order to examine the genes in these functional
groups more closely, individual genes were examined,
including the analysis of genes encoding proteins;
involved in redox functions, involved in a variety of
abiotic stress responses and signalling [34], and nonsymbiotic hemoglobins (NS Hbs), involved in nitric oxide
removal [35] (Figure 5). Notably, nitric oxide has been
reported to be involved in thermo-tolerance [36] and
cold acclimation [37], and interacts with ABA and GA
signalling in Arabidopsis [38]. A comparison of the DEGs
encoding redox functions reveal dramatic changes in
transcript abundance in response to heat, with 9 genes
showing up-regulation in rice in this pathway, whilst the
respective Arabidopsis orthologues were down-regulated
(Figure 5A - boxed green). Specifically, it can be seen
that 4 genes encoding superoxide dismutases were upregulated in rice, whilst the respective orthologues in
Arabidopsis were down-regulated (Figure 5A). Whilst
examining these opposite trends in transcript responses
for genes encoding redox functions, the non-symbiotic
hemoglobin (NS Hbs) encoding genes also appeared to
have this pattern of opposing responses. This was particularly of interest, given that these genes are considered
to play an important role in signalling during stress.
Thus, the finding that they respond in the opposite manner in rice and Arabidopsis, irrespective of the class of
hemoglobin (Figure 5B), suggests that nitric oxide signalling may differ between both species. Notably, other
examples of differential over/under-representation of
functional groups were also seen for genes involved in
amino acids metabolism, secondary metabolism, signalling and transport, which were also seen to respond in
the opposite manner under abiotic stress, again, with
most evidence of this seen in response to heat stress
(Additional file 1, Figure S3).
Core transcriptomic responses under abiotic stress for
rice and Arabidopsis

In order to compare the core abiotic stress responsive
genes in rice and Arabidopsis, each of the 4 stress responsive subsets were overlapped based on the transcriptomic
response for rice (Additional file 1, Figure S4A) and Arabidopsis (Additional file 1, Figure S4B) independently. For
rice, 581 transcripts were down-regulated (Abiotic Down)
and 467 transcripts were up-regulated (Abiotic Up) under
all 4 abiotic stresses analysed (Additional file 1, Figure
S4A). This was smaller for Arabidopsis, with 218 genes
up-regulated and 97 genes down-regulated under all 4
abiotic stress conditions (Additional file 1, Figure S4B).

that make up all the TFs observed in the rice and Arabidopsis genomes, respectively. Comparison of the downregulated groups revealed similarities and differences, with
the Abiotic Down group in rice and Arabidopsis, both
showing enrichment of transcripts encoding kinases (5%
vs. 3% in the rice genome and 21% vs. 10% in the Arabidopsis genome). In contrast to the similarities observed
thus far, it was interesting to note that there was significant under-representation of transcripts encoding transcription factors (11% vs. 16%) and translation functions
(2% vs. 4%), which were only observed in rice, implying
divergence in the transcript response for these functional
groups.

For rice, the core Abiotic Up group was found to be significantly (p < 0.01) enriched in transcripts encoding general
and amino acid metabolism functions with 27% and 5% of
transcripts encoding these functions, compared to 18%
and 3% in the genome, respectively. Similarly, the Abiotic
Up group in Arabidopsis was found to be significantly
enriched in carbohydrate metabolism functions, with 19%
of transcripts encoding these functions compared to 9% in
the genome. Conserved enrichment was also observed for
transcripts encoding transcription factors (TFs), which
were significantly over-represented in both the rice and
Arabidopsis core Abiotic Up sets, with 23% and 36% of
these sets encoding TFs compared to the 16% and 19%

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/262

For the Abiotic Up/Down sets in rice and Arabidopsis,
it was determined how many of these genes had existing
orthologues and how many were showing a common
response under all 4 abiotic stresses in both species. For
the Abiotic Up and Abiotic Down sets in both species,
it is evidenced that 72-81% of the transcripts in each set
have orthologues, which is not only significantly (p <
0.01) greater than the proportion of orthologues in the
rice (37%) and Arabidopsis (61%) genomes, but also
higher than the proportions in the single stress comparison sets (Figure 3; Figure 2B). However, similar to the
previous observations in this study, the overlap in
response of these orthologues is small. Specifically, it
can be seen that for the rice and Arabidopsis Abiotic
Up sets, only 9 transcripts are orthologous and show
the same response at the transcriptomic level under all
4 abiotic stresses in both species (Figure 6Ai). Notably,
this included the transcripts encoding the highly stress
responsive HSF70, a NAC transcription factor and 2
transcripts encoding F-box proteins, implying a conserved regulatory role for these (Figure 6Ai). This is particularly interesting as F-box proteins are highly
conserved in eukaryotes and play a critical role in controlled protein degradation [39]. Unlike the conserved
up-regulated set, only 3 transcripts were found to be
down-regulated under all 4 abiotic stresses in rice and
Arabidopsis, these encoded a single gene of unknown
function and a GATA type transcription factor, encoded
by a single gene in rice (LOC_Os01g74540.1) and 2
genes in Arabidopsis (At3g06740.1, At3g16870.1) (Figure
6Ai). Again, the presence of a transcription factor
implies a conserved regulatory role in both species.
Although the roles of some of these protein have been
studied such as the heat shock factors and proteases,
the role that the two mitochondrial proteins play
(At4g27940 and At5g43150) is not known, and the two
genes (At5g45630 and At1g61340) have been reported
to be regulated by HY5, a bZIP transcription factor
known to be involved in regulating light-responsive promoters and chloroplast biogenesis [40], providing direct
molecular links between the complex light regulatory
network and stress responses [41,42].
In order to examine the transcripts showing opposite
response between Arabidopsis and rice, the Abiotic Up
and Down sets in rice and Arabidopsis were overlapped
(Figure 6Aii). Noticeably, the numbers were very similar
to transcripts that changed in a complementary manner
outlined above. This analysis revealed that 3 transcripts
encoding a potassium ion channel subunit, a betagalactosyltransferase and a GTP binding protein were all
down-regulated under all 4 abiotic stresses in rice,
whilst their corresponding Arabidopsis orthologues were
up-regulated under all 4 abiotic stresses (Figure 6Aii).
Furthermore, 7 transcripts encoding various metabolic

Page 11 of 25

functions were found to be up-regulated under all 4
abiotic stresses in rice, whilst the corresponding orthologue in Arabidopsis were down-regulated under all 4
stress conditions (Figure 6Aii). In addition to the NS
Hbs discussed above (Figure 5B), a mitochondrial protein involved in leucine degradation (At1g03090) and a
protein induced by phosphate starvation (At4g35770)
were also notable. For the other five genes however, no
information was available.
qRT-PCR validation of responses to cold and heat stress

In order to independently validate the transcriptomic
responses of the genes found to be responsive to heat
and cold stress, 16 rice genes and their respective Arabidopsis orthologues (32 genes in total) were analysed by
qRT-PCR. It can be seen that genes showing the core
common responses to abiotic stress showed responses
comparable to the observed responses using microarrays
(Figure 6B). These genes also included a heat shock factor (marker for heat stress) and other stress responsive
genes (Figure 6B). Similarly, the genes found to be
oppositely responsive were also responding in a similar
manner to the microarray data, including the gene
encoding SEN1, which was found to be up-regulated in
rice, whilst the Arabidopsis orthologue of this gene seen
to be down-regulated (Figure 6B). The changes in transcript abundance in response to cold and heat stress
were consistent between the qRT-PCR data obtained
directly experimentally in this study to that of the published microarray data for these stresses. Overall, the
transcript abundance in response to cold and heat
stress, showed a conserved pattern between the independently derived qRT-PCR data (from this study) and
responses based on the microarray data. In addition, to
confirm the validity and effectiveness of the stress treatments carried out (resulting in the microarray data), it
was useful to examine the response of marker genes
such as HSFs for heat and AP-2 transcription factors for
cold stress (Additional file 1, Figure S5A and B). Phylogenetic analysis of a subset of known heat responsive
HSFs and known cold responsive AP-2 TFs showed that
these genes were not only closely related but also
showed the expected up-regulation responses to heat
and cold stress. In addition, this phylogenetic analysis
was also carried out for the related genes of SEN1 in
rice and Arabidopsis (Additional file 1, Figure S5C). As
expected, it was seen that despite the close relation
between SEN1 in rice and Arabidopsis, there was difference in expression observed with up-regulation observed
in rice and down-regulation observed in Arabidopsis
(Figure 6B; Additional file 1, Figure S5C). These findings
indicate that despite the variety of sources from which
the microarray data was derived from, the normalisation
and analysis processes are robust and the trends

Figure 6 Core stress responsive gene expression. The transcripts significantly (p < 0.05, PPDE > 0.96) increasing or decreasing in abundance
in rice and Arabidopsis under drought, salt, cold and heat treated plants were overlapped based on their common response (Abiotic core - UP,
DOWN, respectively). A) Genes which were part of these Abiotic core sets for rice and Arabidopsis were overlapped again in order to determine
the number of transcripts with no orthologues (lightest gray shade), with known orthologues (darker gray shade) and the number of transcripts
which were orthologous and showing a common (overlap) or opposite (overlap) response across all 4 abiotic stresses. ii) For each of the
common and oppositely responding transcripts, the log2 fold change is shown for the control vs. treated as a heatmap, where red represents
up-regulation and blue represents down-regulation. For Arabidopsis, only a single time point is shown, depending on which time point
comparison was significant (Methods section). Genes indicated in bold were also analysed by qRT-PCR (as shown below). B) qRT-PCR results
showing the log2 fold changes of 16 rice genes and 16 Arabidopsis genes in response to cold (dark red) and heat (green) stress. Note that these
16 genes represent orthologous genes in Arabidopsis and rice. The log2 fold changes based on the microarray data is also presented for
comparison.

observed can be reproduced independently. Thus, the
differences in responses cannot be attributed to experimental variation alone.
Regulation of transcription factors under abiotic stress for
rice and Arabidopsis

The above analysis indicates that the transcriptional
response to abiotic stress differs significantly in terms of
gene orthology and function between Arabidopsis and
rice. This suggests that the regulation of these responses
may also have changed and thus the transcription factors underlying these responses and the cis-elements
that define transcript abundance were analysed to determine if they also displayed significant differences. In
both Arabidopsis and rice, a large number of genes
encode transcription factors (TFs) [43]. Defining orthology for TFs removes many TFs for both species, as they
are grouped into families based on structural features or
small domains. Therefore, to compare the transcript
abundance of genes encoding TFs, a comparison was
made based on family classification. In this way, the different sizes of the families in both species would be
taken into account. Only significantly (z-score, p < 0.01)
over/under represented TF families in each subset are
shown in Figure 7, however if one family is significantly
over- or under- represented at p < 0.01 in rice or Arabidopsis, and it is significant at p < 0.02 in the other species, it was indicated with a + in the latter (Additional
file 2, Table S7). Overall, the most conserved changes
between rice and Arabidopsis were observed with the
AP2 family of TFs, with comparable changes observed
in the drought (up), salt (up) and cold (up, down)
responsive sub-sets (Figure 7). However, even for this
family, different responses were observed in the drought
and salt sub-sets for down-regulated genes (Figure 7).
Also, in these down-regulated drought and salt responsive subsets, the AUX and NAC family of TFs were
found to be significantly over-represented (Figure 7). A
number of other families were conserved in response to
the single stress treatments such as Tify (drought up),
mTERF (salt down), bZIP (heat up), ARF (heat down)
and HSF (heat up, p < 0.02 for Arabidopsis) in Arabidopsis and rice. However, under the four conditions
examined several TF families are specifically overrepresented in rice alone such as the trihelix, WRKY,
and bZIP families, whilst the GRAS family was overrepresented in Arabidopsis. Likewise in many instances,
genes encoding specific TFs were under-represented,
such as HB in the heat responsive set (up) in Arabidopsis and WRKY in rice (Figure 7). Thus, despite the conserved enrichment for some TF families (e.g. AP2 in
response to cold stress), this pattern was not always
consistently observed across both species. The observed
differential expression and differential representation of

Page 13 of 25

transcription factors between rice and Arabidopsis complements the observed divergence in the transcriptomic
responses following abiotic stresses between both
species.
Given the significant difference in genome size
between the rice and Arabidopsis, it is important to
consider the potential effect of duplication and pseudofunctionalisation on the in the results observed. As with
all the comparisons in this study, each gene family was
compared to the respective genome before further comparisons were made across species, eliminating the bias
effect of the genome size. A good example of this is for
the AP2 TF family, it can be seen that despite the difference in genome sizes, the proportions of AP2 TFs were
conserved, making up 6.64% and 6.86% of all TFs in rice
and Arabidopsis, respectively. Similarly, HSFs make up
1.12% and 1.2% of all TFs in rice and Arabidopsis, indicating a conserved representation of these across both
genomes. Therefore the conserved over-representation
of AP2 TFs and HSFs in the sets of genes up regulated
in cold and heat stress respectively represents an
unbiased, conserved response. Furthermore, when subgroups of AP2 TFs (DREBs) and HSFs were phlyogenetically analysed, the orthology between the genes in
each of these subsets were clearly seen, as well as a conserved pattern of up-regulation (Additional file 1, Figure
S5B and C) indicating conservation, both at the gene
and expression levels for these families. In contrast, it
can be seen that despite similarity in TF family size e.g.
for the WRKY family (3.56% and 3.38% of all TFs in
rice and Arabidopsis, respectively), this family was only
found to be over-represented in the drought and salt
responsive sets in rice and not Arabidopsis, revealing
species specific differences in the response of these
genes.
Promoter Analysis of transcriptome of Rice and
Arabidopsis

Previous studies and the analysis so far have focussed on
expression levels, with this study focussing on similarities and differences in the expression of orthologous
genes. A gene is defined as orthologous when there is
commonality in the function of the encoded protein,
and thereby similarity at the level of the protein
sequence as well. Considering this, it was asked whether
the genes that were both orthologous and showing a
common response were also regulated in the same manner i.e. share commonality in promoter/transcriptional
regulation. To answer this, putative cis-acting regulatory
elements (CAREs) were examined in each of the orthologous sub-sets regulated in the same way. Specifically,
all 4,096 possible 6-mers were counted within the 1 kb
upstream regions for all genes in the rice genome
(TIGR6) and Arabidopsis (TAIR9) genome, as well as

Figure 7 Analysis of changes in transcript abundance for genes encoding transcription factors. All the genes encoding transcription
factors were collated for Arabidopsis and rice and the distribution of these transcription factor families changing in abundance within the total
stress responsive sets were examined for A) drought (blue), B) salt (yellow), C) cold (pink) and D) heat (green). The distribution of transcripts
encoding transcription factors in each family, within is stress responsive subset (e.g. Up drought) was compared to the percentage present in
the respective genome. In this way, over/under-represented transcription factor families within each subset could be determined for Arabidopsis
and rice separately. Over- or under-representation is indicated by red or blue asterisk respectively (at p < 0.01). Note that some transcription
factor families were statistically significant at p < 0.025, these are indicated by ^. The % breakdown of each family within each subset is shown
next to the genome (lighter shades - Arabidopsis, darker shades (rice).

for each sub-set. The occurrence of the putative motifs
in each set of DEGs was made relative to the occurrence
in all the genes in each respective genome. In this way,
it could be seen whether a sub-set of genes contained a
significantly greater or smaller percentage of putative
motifs in the promoters of these genes compared to the
percentage occurrence in the promoters of all the genes
in the genome (denoted as a value of 1; Figure 8). Given
that a large number of motif counts were generated for

each subset and a large number were significant (p <
0.01), a cut-off of 20% was set for short-listing the putative motifs. That is, the final set of putative motifs
showed the motifs that were significant AND present
20% more/less than the percentage occurrence of that
putative motif in the genome.
Ratios of the putative motif counts to the genome was
hierarchically clustered, where the bright red represents
motifs that occurred at least 50% more often than the

Figure 8 Analysis of putative motifs for core orthologous genes showing common response under abiotic stress. A) The occurrence of
all possible 6-mers was calculated in each of the core orthologous up-regulated subsets for rice and Arabidopsis. The occurrence of each motif
in a subset was made relative to the occurrence of that motif in all promoters in the respective genomes. Heat map intensity represents over
(red) or under (blue) representation of putative motifs compared to the genome. From the 4,096 possible 6-mers, only the putative motifs
present 20% more or less often than the percentage presence in the genome were visualised e.g. a value of 1.2 indicates that this motif in the
respective subset occurs 20% more than the occurrence of this motif in the genome, whilst a value of 0.8 indicates that this motifs occurs 20%
less than the percentage occurrence in the genome. Examples of conserved over-represented motifs within different stress subsets are indicated
in the black boxes. B) The top 3 over-represented motifs from each of the up-regulated subsets are indicated on the heatmap by the coloured
boxes. Note that motifs over-represented in the UP and DOWN regulated sets are indicated by an asterisk *. For the motifs representing known
TF binding sites, the respective TF is annotated; the number in brackets indicates the associated reference. C) Examination of over/underrepresented known 3’UTR motifs in each subset. Note that the number in brackets indicates the associated reference.

(Figure 8A). It was immediately evident that the pattern
of occurrence of putative CAREs differs between species
as Arabidopsis and rice forms two distinct branches
(Figure 8A). There appears to be more similarity within
a species in response to a number of stresses rather
than between species in response to the same stress.
This was especially seen for Arabidopsis, where the
DEGs responding to drought and salt, and cold to a lesser extent, displayed similar patterns of CAREs present
in their promoters (Figure 8A; Additional file 1, Figure
S6). In contrast, the occurrence of CAREs in rice appear
to be distinct for each stress, this may be a reflection of
the larger number of responses in rice for drought and
salt (Figure 3). Again, in response to heat, there appears
to be a distinction in terms of motif occurrence for the
rice DEGs (Figure 8A).
Looking for common elements between species it was
noticeable that there were common elements in both
the drought and salt response in Arabidopsis and rice
(Figure 8A, black boxes). The 3 significant (p < 0.01)
and most over-represented motifs (“top ranked”) are
shown in Figure 8B. Searches for these putative motifs
across relevant publications ([44-51] in Figure 8)
revealed that 5 of the top over-represented motifs
appear to be ABREs and are targets of bZIP transcription factors [47-50]. Noticeably, the AP2 transcription
factor family (drought and salt up) and Auxin and NAC
(drought and salt down) display conserved responses in
these treatments (Figure 7), suggesting that they may
bind these motifs. This is also supported by the finding
that the motif, “cacgtg” (ranked 2; Figure 8B) appears to
be conserved and over-represented in the genes upregulated under drought and salt in Arabidopsis and
rice and this motifs is similar to the recognised NAC
binding site [52]. Interestingly, a similar observation was
also made for the putative motifs over-represented
under cold conditions in both species, where GC-rich
motifs, characteristic of AP2 TF binding sites were overrepresented in the cold responsive transcripts (Figure
8Bii) [53]. Again, divergence in the heat response was
further supported by the finding that the top three elements over-represented in heat responsive genes (green
boxes) do not overlap with the top three putative motifs
from the DEGs under other stresses (Figure 8B).
Lastly, given the large number of down-regulated
genes observed in drought and stress conditions, we
examined the over-representation of putative motifs in
the 3’UTRs for motifs associated with mRNA degradation. Ideally, this would be compared directly as done
for the promoters, identifying the most over-represented
motifs, however less than 10% of all rice genes have
sequence information available for the 3’UTRs, thus it
was only feasible to examine previously identified/implicated motifs associated with mRNA degradation.

Page 16 of 25

Stabilisation and destabilisation motifs previously identified [54-57] were examined and interestingly for the
genes in the drought and salt responsive sub-sets, a significant over-representation of destabilisation and significant under-representation of stabilisation motifs were
observed, corresponding with the larger number of
down-regulated genes observed in rice and Arabidopsis
following drought and salt stress.

Discussion
A major role of model organisms is to facilitate investigation and gain insights into biological mechanisms that
can be applied to other organisms. A good example is
how research on Arabidopsis impacts on research in the
biomedical field [58], despite the ~1 billion years since
divergence. More commonly, research using model species is usually used in comparisons within phylogenetic
boundaries, i.e. plant, animal or fungi. Arabidopsis and
rice are the forefront plant dicot and monocot models,
respectively. A variety of comparisons between these
species have been carried out from the genome [59],
proteome [60] and metabolome levels [61] revealing
insights into conserved and distinct features and
responses. At a transcriptome level, a variety of comparisons have also been carried out with a variety of gene
families (see introduction for examples). In this study, a
comparison of organ and abiotic stress responses was
carried out at the global transcriptome level. Given that
abiotic stress responses were compared between rice
and Arabidopsis, it is important to point out that each
of these species has evolved different mechanisms or
tolerances optimising their survival in their native climates. This is particularly relevant in terms of optimal
climatic conditions, where Arabidopsis is grown in a
temperate climate (22°C) [62], whilst optimal growth
conditions for rice is in a tropical climate (28-30°C)
[63]. Therefore, any results derived from comparisons to
extreme temperature stress would reveal not only the
response to the temperature but also incorporate the
natural responses to the respective temperature. The
comparisons in this study were done to define similarities and differences at a global level for the first time.
While similarities point to conserved processes and provide targets to dissect basic core processes, differences
provide opportunities to identify different approaches
that have arisen in evolution. Note that differences also
represent the divergent responses to the conditions
applied, not just a reflection of the basal transcriptome,
and thus have the potential to reveal the diversity of
responses to altering conditions. While analysing the
differences between closely related varieties of a species,
such as in Arabidopsis, in which whole genome
approaches can now be applied to tens or even hundreds of varieties, has the potential to reveal the

Narsai et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/262

diversity in responses within essentially a very similar set
of genes, analysis between different species will reveal
alternative responses.
When carrying out comparisons between species, the
typical assumption is that similar genes (defined as
orthologues) are likely to have similar responses. When
analysing both transcript response and orthology, it is
important to consider the stringency in the definition of
orthologues. Previous studies, may have over-estimated
the proportion of rice genes that have Arabidopsis
orthologues and vice versa, however, these estimates
were most likely based on the sequence of genes that
had been determined and over-estimated. The data presented here is conservative, in that the definition of
orthology is based on the Inparanoid data - which could
be considered a gold standard. However, even using
functional based definitions of gene function (e.g. Pageman FUNCATs) the responses are still observed to be
divergent for certain functional groups as a whole. Thus,
irrespective of the strict definition of orthology, or even
same the functional categorisation, the responses
between Arabidopsis and rice appear to be divergent for
specific groups of genes, particularly in response to
abiotic stress.
This study revealed that the transcriptional network
and underlying cis and trans regulatory factors of rice
and Arabidopsis differs significantly in many aspects.
Only by multi-dimensional analysis of gene expression
across a multitude of microarray studies in both species,
was it possible to get an idea of the transcriptomic flexibility i.e. the proportion of genes showing tissue specific
or differential expression under various abiotic stress
conditions. Combining expression with orthology
revealed the danger in assuming orthology also reflects
similarity in transcriptomic or even proteomic response.
Firstly, the specific transcriptomes of rice seeds, flower,
leaf and root was seen to be distinct to that of Arabidopsis, notably complying with findings from other transcriptomic studies [32,64]. This lack of orthology
between these “organ specific” genes indicates that the
observed morphological differences between rice and
Arabidopsis organs are also correlated with distinct gene
expression and although correlation is not cause, it does
present a possible avenue by which distinct morphology
can be obtained. While the overlap in organ specific
expression between Arabidopsis and rice is low at the
level of gene orthology, for roots the overlap in function
for many categories is much higher. Thus, despite differences in roots between monocots and dicots [65], it
appears that at a functional level, the organ specific
transcript profiles are more conserved compared to
flower, seed and leaf.
In contrast, it was observed that a significantly larger
proportion of genes with orthologues were present in

Page 17 of 25

each of the abiotic stress responsive sets compared to
the percentage of orthologues in the whole genome
level. This suggests that although distinct genes may
explain morphological differences between species, it
may not be the reason for differential tolerances to abiotic stresses. Interestingly, the proportions of genes showing comparable, opposite and unchanging responses to
abiotic stresses differed between rice and Arabidopsis.
These represent particularly important findings, given
that most studies tend to focus on similarities between
plants, especially when considering orthologous genes.
In rice, there were more than 4 times as many DEGs
following drought and salt stress compared to the number of DEGs following these stresses in Arabidopsis, and
this cannot only be accounted for by differences in the
gene coding content of the respective genomes, as the
number of differentially expressed genes in response to
heat and cold for both species was approximately the
same. In addition, this is also not due to species specific
rice gene expression as there is in fact a larger percentage of known Arabidopsis orthologues for the rice
genes changing under drought and salt stress (> 50%)
compared to the genome percentage (~31% Arabidopsis
orthologues). Noticeably, despite differences in the number of DEGs, it was evidenced that the number of DEGs
showing opposite responses was much lower than the
number of DEGs showing complementary changes, indicating that the response to drought or salt stress is
more conserved. Closer examination of the orthologous
genes showing common expression responses revealed
the conserved down-regulation of translation functions
and up-regulation of membrane transport functions in
both Arabidopsis and rice. This suggests that under
these conditions, energy demanding process such as
translation are down-regulated, whilst the change in
water content under drought or salt stress affects membrane fluidity in a conserved manner.
Interestingly, the number of DEGs under heat and
cold stress were found to be comparable across rice and
Arabidopsis. However, it was surprising to find that
equal or more orthologous genes responded in the
opposite manner as in those responding in a similar
manner, providing novel evidence for a divergence in
the regulation of these genes in response to temperature
extremities. Specifically, an overall up-regulation of rice
genes was observed compared to the respective orthologous genes in Arabidopsis following cold or heat stress.
This suggests that the regulation of gene expression in
response to these temperature extremities has diverged,
with genes involved in secondary metabolism, amino
acid degradation and redox metabolism being upregulated under these conditions in rice, whilst the Arabidopsis orthologues remained unchanging or oppositely
regulated. Overall, it is important to note that the

Narsai et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/262

number of DEGs observed in response to abiotic stress
between Arabidopsis and rice cannot only be attributed
to the differences in the size of gene families or duplication of genes. A specific example of this principle was
seen for the non-symbiotic haemoglobin encoding
genes, where the transcripts for all gene family members
responded in opposite manners.
Given the general down-regulatory trend observed for
the transcripts encoding redox pathway components in
Arabidopsis following heat treatment, it was of interest
to consider the regulatory mechanisms that may be controlling this down-regulation. Typically, transcriptional
control is examined as the main mechanism regulating
transcript abundance, however, given the observed
down-regulation, a role for mRNA degradation was also
considered. A previous study examined the global
mRNA degradation rates for Arabidopsis, following
transcriptional inhibition [55]. Brief examination of the
mRNA half-lives of the genes encoding redox pathway
components (as in the Arabidopsis genes in Figure 4)
revealed remarkably high mRNA half-lives (> 10 h) for
several of these genes, including 2 genes encoding catalases (AT4G35090, AT1G20630), a gene encoding
DHAR (AT5G16710), 2 genes encoding dismutases
(AT4G25100, AT3G10920), a gene encoding GR
(AT3G54660) and the gene encoding a non-symbiotic
hemoglobin (AT2G16060). mRNA half-lives of >10 h
indicates a high level of stability of these mRNAs, thus
it was surprising to note the significant down-regulation
of these within only 3 h of heat treatment in Arabidopsis. Similarly, a large down-regulation of transcripts
encoding translation functions is seen to occur in both
Arabidopsis and rice following drought or salt treatment, again within only 3 h of stress treatment. The
observed rapid down-regulation of these transcripts in
Arabidopsis was somewhat surprising, given the
expected high level of stability of these transcripts [55]
and may be explained by a mechanism of active degradation. A previous study in yeast revealed that in
response to changes in oxygen availability, there is active
degradation of specific transcripts that occurs faster
than the steady state decay rates [66]. Considering this,
it is possible that part of the response mechanism to different abiotic stresses is the active degradation of specific transcripts, e.g. the possible active degradation of
transcripts encoding redox pathway components following heat treatment in Arabidopsis.
In terms of transcriptional regulatory processes, it also
appears that there were more differences than similarities
between rice and Arabidopsis. Global comparison of all
over-represented, putative cis-acting sites within the 1 kb
upstream regions of co-expressed orthologous genes
revealed some unexpected findings. Specifically, it was
observed that even when similar expression patterns were

Page 18 of 25

observed under abiotic stress for orthologous genes in
both species, the regulatory mechanisms that drive these
responses appeared to differ, with some exceptions. Overall, these findings indicate that even when two plants have
similar genes (orthologues) in their genome and even if
these genes show similarities in their transcriptomic
responses, it is possible that the factors regulating this
gene expression can differ. To consider these factors in
both species, the expression of TFs was considered. Notably, the CAREs and TF families of AP2 and NAC were
found to be enriched in both species in response to several
abiotic stresses, complying with the previously established
conserved regulatory role for these families in both Arabidopsis and rice [53]. Thus, the outcome of the in silico
analysis in this study was strengthened by the support of
previous experimental observation. Notably, although
some NAC TFs responded in the same manner between
Arabidopsis and rice under certain abiotic stresses, it has
also been suggested that NAC TFs may have additional
roles in rice [53]. Other groups of TFs also enriched in the
response of both species to specific stresses included the
Auxin TFs in response to drought and salt, and bZIP, HSF
and GNAT in response to heat. With the exception of the
cold responsive set, overall, more families of TFs appeared
to be affected in rice, compared to Arabidopsis. This suggests that in rice, the regulatory network in response to
abiotic stress is more diverse and that TFs have addition
roles in the stress response.
In addition to transcriptional regulation, the changes
observed in transcript abundance observed are also the
result of post-transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, a
brief search of the genes encoding the oppositely regulated transcripts in Arabidopsis revealed some examples
of genes with known to be regulated at the posttranscriptional level. For example, a recent study of the
regulation of SEN1 (At4g35770) revealed that the transcript level for this gene as well as two other genes; a
gene encoding a leucine zipper TF (At2g22430) and an
gene with unknown function (At3g26740) are regulated
by a controlled mRNA degradation mechanism [67].
Targets of this controlled mRNA degradation pathway,
including the aforementioned genes, are characterised
by the presence of the downstream (DST) motif in their
3’UTRs and this motif is associated with rapid degradation of these transcripts [67]. Notably, in Arabidopsis,
all 3 of the aforementioned genes are down-regulated in
response to one or more abiotic stresses whilst the rice
orthologues of these genes are up-regulated or
unchanged in abundance for that stress. In addition, a
brief search for the DST motif in the rice orthologues of
these genes revealed that the DST motif was not present
in these 3’UTRs, providing an example that indicates
potential divergence in post-transcriptional regulation
between Arabidopsis and rice.

Narsai et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/262

The differences in the transcriptome response of Arabidopsis and rice provides opportunities to identify species specific responses and thus broaden the possibilities
of transferring traits from model to crop species. In this
respect, the orthologous genes that significantly changed
in opposite directions warrant further investigations.
Notably, the transcripts of many genes in these various
sub-sets encode proteins involved in stress defence and
are classified as such. The control and regulation of
genes involved in various processes classified as redox,
biotic stress and secondary metabolism, which are all
intimately associated with stress responses, will likely
reveal species specific regulation and response that may
offer new insights for translational biology. In particular,
the fact that a non-symbiotic hemoglobin gene is regulated in the opposite manner in rice (up) compared to
Arabidopsis (down) in all 4 stresses merits investigations
into nitric oxide signalling differences that may exist
between both plants in response to abiotic stress [68].
In addition, the finding that transcripts encoding components involved in redox functions also displayed
opposite trends under heat stress, suggests that differences in reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen
species related functions may exist between both species. Although there are reports where the expression of
heterologous genes in crop species confers resistance to
a stress [23], this is often accompanied by growth penalties [66]. One possible reason for the observed growth
penalties is the different interaction and/or regulatory
environments of genes (or more correctly the proteins
they encode) in different species. Thus, although reactive oxygen or nitrogen species are likely to play signalling roles in both Arabidopsis and rice under a variety
of conditions, especially stress, the response to these signals may differ significantly.

Conclusions
Large scale systems biology projects are well advanced to
define the function of all genes in Arabidopsis and to
understand genome to phenome relationships under various environmental conditions [69,70]. However, in order
to fully exploit the power of Arabidopsis as a model, it is
as important to know what is common and different with
other plants, and also what responses in other plants may
be unique, in that they are not observed in Arabidopsis.
Given the different native temperature growth conditions
and the ~140 million years of divergence between Arabidopsis and rice, it is vital to understand the level of comparability between these species. Differences in the
transcriptomic response to heat stress was particularly of
interest, as these responsive genes may represents key
genes for translational biology studies aiming to increase
heat tolerance in other plants, which is a growing area of
research given the observed increase in global warming.

Page 19 of 25

Overall, the results of the analysis presented here reveal
for the first time at the global level, that there is not a single relationship between genome, in terms of gene orthology, and phenome across species. Rather, there are likely
to be a number of dynamic combinations of a genome or
transcriptome to produce a phenome, and these combinations will differ between plants depending on both the
environment and evolutionary distance that allows divergence. This cautions against assumptions that orthology
equals similarity in cellular responses. It also provides a
rational basis for the selection of candidate genes for
translational research. Specifically, via the selection of
genes that respond in a similar manner or transcription
factors that regulate genes in a similar manner between
species. Furthermore, the genes responding in an opposite
manner do not necessarily represent barriers to translation; rather they represent opportunities to equip plants
with novel solutions to environmental stimuli.

Methods
Publically available rice and Arabidopsis microarrays

To compile the entire publically available Affymetrix rice
microarray (as at 1 st August 2009), all experiments
containing CEL files were downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus within the National Centre for BiotechnoIogy Information database or from the MIAME
ArrayExpress database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/.
The GSE or EXP numbers for the respective rice studies
are shown in Table 1. The rice array was defined as the
57,302 probesets, thus the 81 probesets designed for the
bacterial/phage controls were not included. There was a
total of 366 microarrays, representing 129 tissues/conditions, with a minimum of 2 biological replicates for rice.
The 129 included 48 developmental tissues, 77 samples
within abiotic and biotic stress experiments and 11 samples within hormone treatment experiments. The abiotic
stress experiments involved single treatments with cold,
salt, drought (GSE6901) and heat (GSE14275). To carry
out parallel analysis for developmental conditions in Arabidopsis, the Arabidopsis developmental dataset consisting
of 237 microarrays representing 79 developmental stages
was downloaded as CEL files (E-AFMX-9; E-TABM-17).
Also, to carry out parallel analysis of abiotic stresses in
Arabidopsis, the microarray data from the 0.5 h, 1 h and 3
h abiotic stress treated (cold - GSE5621, salt - GSE5623,
drought - GSE5624, heat - GSE5628) and respective control samples (E-GOED-5620) was downloaded. Thus, a
total of 627 microarrays were analysed within this study,
enabling large scale parallel comparison between rice and
Arabidopsis at a transcriptomic level during development
and under four abiotic stresses. Note that for Arabidopsis,
the abiotic stress experiments involved shoots from 18-day
old seedlings, whilst in rice these stress treatments were
carried out on 7-day old seedlings for the drought, salt

Narsai et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/262

and cold stress conditions [39] and 14-day old seedlings
for the heat stress experiment [71] (Table 1).
Microarray analyses

All raw intensity CEL files were imported into Avadis
4.3 (Strand Genomics, India) and the standard MAS5.0
normalisation was first carried out in order to determine
present/absent/marginal calls for each probeset. All probesets that encoded bacterial genes were excluded, leaving a global rice set consisting of 57,302 probesets and a
global Arabidopsis set of 22,710. Probesets that were
called present in two or more replicates were considered
to be expressed and used for further analysis. All of the
present/absent data for all 366 microarrays were compiled and it was determined which probesets were present in all 129 tissues/conditions, defined as “Always
expressed” and which were present in none of the
microarrays, defined as “Never expressed” on microarrays. Furthermore, a probeset was considered to be transiently or “Specifically expressed” if it was present in
only one sample i.e. present in at least 2 replicates of
one sample and less than 2 replicates in all other samples. In this way, developmental stage/tissue specific
probesets were identified for both rice and Arabidopsis.
However, this method only included single stage/tissue
specific probesets, thus this was expanded further to
include probesets present in one or more developmental
stage for that tissue e.g. at one or more stage of inflorescence (and less than two replicates for all other tissues).
Differential expression analyses

In order to analyse the rice microarray data from the
abiotic stress experiments, differential expression was
carried out. Firstly, a present set for each experiment
was determined i.e. present in >/= 2 replicates in the
control and/or treated samples and only these were
included for further analysis. For each stress experiment,
the GC-RMA normalised data (control and stress treated) were used as the input set for the differential
expression analysis. This was carried out using the
Cyber-T method, which implements a Bayesian method
for determination of probesets showing significant
changes in transcript abundance. The PPDE method
within Cyber-T was used for false discovery rate calculation. All input criteria were set according to Cyber-T
recommendations applicable for each experimental set.
A probeset was defined as significantly changing at p <
0.05, with a PPDE of >0.96 (false discovery rate). These
cut-offs and this Bayesian method of differential expression has been verified and has been used in previous
microarray studies [72,73]. For each abiotic stress
experiment in rice, single comparisons were involved i.e.
treated vs. control. For Arabidopsis, these experiments
were carried out as a time course, however only the

Page 20 of 25

0.5 h, 1 h and 3 h post-treatment microarrays were considered for analysis as this was considered to be a more
parallel reflection of the stress treatments in rice and
also, it was the only time points consistent across all 4
stress experiments i.e. heat stress was not sampled after
3 h in Arabidopsis. In this way 4 comparisons for rice;
and 12 comparisons for Arabidopsis; abiotic stress vs.
control were carried out. For Arabidopsis, the differential expression analysis involved a comparison for each
time point, within each stress experiment and the differentially expressed list was generated on the criteria that
a probeset had to be changing (up/down) at one or
more time points in the same direction (up/down) with
no significant changes in the opposite direction.
Functional annotation and statistical analysis

For all the transcripts represented on the rice microarray, the function of the encoded proteins was analysed,
where functional annotation was available. For each probeset, the GO annotation and transcript assignments
from Affymetrix was retrieved. The National Science
Foundation rice microarray database was used to match
rice probeset identifiers to The Integrated Genome
Resource (TIGR) identifiers for rice. Similarly, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database was
used to match Arabidopsis probesets identifiers to Arabidopsis Genome Identifiers (AGI) as At numbers. For
all the rice transcripts matched to a single TIGR identifier, the rice TIGR database (Yuan et al) was used to
determine putative protein functions. Note that only
~80% of all probesets had annotated TIGR identifiers.
To analyse transcripts based on the broad function of
the encoded protein, the FUNctional CATalogue (FUNCAT) for rice based on the Australian National University Gene-bins database was used for the whole genome
set. To improve and add to this, two FUNCATs; transcription factors and kinases were independently added.
The list of transcription factors was based one or more
of the following sources; DRTF [74], RiceTFDB [75],
and Caldana et al., 2007 [31]. Kinases were annotated
based on the rice kinase database [76].
In order to determine if there was a statistically significant over or under-representation of a particular FUNCAT within a subset compared to the genome, a
z-score analysis was carried out based on the difference
between the two proportions, given that the sample
sizes and frequency of each FUNCAT is known:
z=

ˆ
ˆ
1 −  2
1
1
ˆ
ˆ
 (1 −  )( + )
n1 n 2

A cumulative standard normal Table was used to
match the z-score and based on this, the P values were

Narsai et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:262
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/262

determined. The same method was used for transcription factors where the proportion of transcription factor
families within a subset was compared against the full
list of transcription factors.
Pageman analysis

In order to analyse the rice microarray data from the
abiotic stress experiments, differential PageMan [33] and
analyses were carried out using a reduced set of unique
probesets representing the differentially expressed genes.
For the Pageman analysis, Fisher’s test for ORA (overrepresentation analysis) analysis was carried out in Pageman in order to determine statistically significant over/
under representation of genes classified into specific
BINS. Given that Pageman does not allow visualisation
of data from more than species at once, the raw data for
rice and Arabidopsis was exported, matched and visualised in parallel using Partek Genomics Suite (version
6.5) to produce the output seen in Figure 2D and 4.
Analysis of orthologues

The InParanoid: Eukaryotic Ortholog Groups database
(version 7.0) was used to analyse all orthologues
between rice and Arabidopsis [30]. The orthologous
group file was downloaded for the whole-genome comparison of rice versus Arabidopsis. This produced information for orthologues identified by TIGR identifiers for
rice and AGIs for Arabidopsis.
Phylogeny analysis of genes

Using the protein sequences for the AP2, HSF, SEN1
and non-symbiotic hemoglobin encoding genes in rice
and Arabidopsis, multiple sequence alignments were
carried out using MAFFT [77] and visualized using Multiple align show http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/multi_align.html. The program IQPNNI [78] was used to
reconstruct a maximum likelihood phylogeny assuming
the Whelan and Goldman model [79]. Phylogenetic
trees were finally visualized using the program Geneious
http://www.geneious.com. For the non-symbiotic haemoglobin phylogenetic tree in Figure 6, the sequence for
a non-symbiotic hemoglobin-encoding gene in soybean
was also included as an outside comparison.
Stress treatments, tissue collection and RNA isolation

In order to analyse the response to heat and cold stress
for Arabidopsis and rice independently from the microarray data, expression analysis was carried out for the
genes shown in Figure 6. For Arabidopsis, Col-0 seeds
were grown on MS liquid media at 22°C for 2-weeks.
Two hours into the light, the 2-week old seedlings were
transferred to 4°C for cold stress and 38 C for heat
stress (as carried out by Kilian et al., 2007 [80]) for 3 h,

Page 21 of 25

whilst the controls remained at a constant temperature
of 22°C. For rice, wild type cv. Amaroo seeds were
grown for 2 weeks at 30°C. Two hours into the light,
the 2-week old seedlings were transferred to 4°C for
cold stress (as carried out by Jain et al., 2008 [39]) and
42°C for heat stress (as carried out by Han et al., 2009
[71]) for 3 h, whilst the controls remained at a constant
temperature of 30°C. All tissue samples were grown and
collected using three biological replicates for each control and treatment experiment resulting in 9 independent samples for rice and 9 independent samples for
Arabidopsis. The RNA was isolated using the Qiagen
RNeasy Plant RNA isolation kit and DNase treated
using both the Qiagen on-column DNase digestion as
well as the Ambion Turbo DNase treatment exactly as
carried out in Narsai et al., 2007 [55].
QRT-PCR analysis

Details of the primer sequences, amplicon lengths and
RNA to qRT-PCR quality checks for each of the genes
analysed are shown in Additional file 1, Table S8.
Overall, the procedures for RNA isolation and qRTPCR for both rice and Arabidopsis were carried out as
described in a recent rice reference gene study [81].
Specifically, transcript abundance for each gene was
measured using the SYBR green I master (Roche, Sydney) with the Roche LC480 machine. Each control and
treated sample was analysed in biological triplicate,
using individual plants in order to test for reproducibility. Isolated RNA was quantitated using a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed using the Bio-Rad® (Sydney) iScript reverse
transcription kit, according manufacturer’s instructions. In parallel to each sample, another 1 μg of RNA
was used for the same reverse transcription reaction,
with the exception of the addition of the reverse transcriptase enzyme (no RT samples) in order to confirm
no DNA contamination. The cDNA and no RT samples were then purified using the Qiagen® PCR purification kit, according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For the qRT-PCR analysis, 1 μl of this purified cDNA
(diluted 1 in 10) for each sample was analysed as well
as 1 μl of the undiluted no RT samples. Analysis of
the no RT samples in this way allows the detection of
any genomic DNA contamination. In order to analyse
the data produced by the qRT-PCR quantitation, the
comparative Ct method was employed. This method
relies on comparison of the threshold cycle numbers of
the treated vs. control samples and has been used previously to analyse qRT-PCR data [81]. An outline/
checklist for qRT-PCR data presentation has been generated based on a template provided in [82] and this
shown in Additional file 1, Table S8C.
