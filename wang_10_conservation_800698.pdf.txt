Conservation between higher plants and the
moss Physcomitrella patens in response to the
phytohormone abscisic acid: a proteomics
analysis

Abstract
Background: The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is ubiquitous among land plants where it plays an important
role in plant growth and development. In seeds, ABA induces embryogenesis and seed maturation as well as seed
dormancy and germination. In vegetative tissues, ABA is a necessary mediator in the triggering of many of the
physiological and molecular adaptive responses of the plant to adverse environmental conditions, such as
desiccation, salt and cold.
Results: In this study, we investigated the influence of abscisic acid (ABA) on Physcomitrella patens at the level of
the proteome using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sixty-five protein spots showed changes in response to ABA treatment. Among them,
thirteen protein spots were down-regulated; fifty-two protein spots were up-regulated including four protein spots
which were newly induced. These proteins were involved in various functions, including material and energy
metabolism, defense, protein destination and storage, transcription, signal transduction, cell growth/division,
transport, and cytoskeleton. Specifically, most of the up-regulated proteins functioned as molecular chaperones,
transcriptional regulators, and defense proteins. Detailed analysis of these up-regulated proteins showed that ABA
could trigger stress and defense responses and protect plants from oxidative damage. Otherwise, three protein
kinases involved in signal pathways were up-regulated suggesting that P. patens is sensitive to exogenous ABA.
The down-regulated of the Rubisco small subunit, photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex proteins and
photosystem assembly protein ycf3 indicated that photosynthesis of P. patens was inhibited by ABA treatment.
Conclusion: Proteome analysis techniques have been applied as a direct, effective, and reliable tool in differential
protein expressions. Sixty-five protein spots showed differences in accumulation levels as a result of treatment with
ABA. Detailed analysis these protein functions showed that physiological and molecular responses to the plant
hormone ABA appear to be conserved among higher plant species and bryophytes.

Background
Plants undergo continuous exposure to various biotic
and abiotic stresses in their natural environment. To
survive under such conditions, plants activate signaling
cascades that lead to the accumulation of endogenous
hormones which, in turn, trigger the induction of
defense responses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a small,

lipophilic phytohormone that regulates many important
aspects of plant growth and development and plays a
crucial role in cellular responses to environmental stresses such as drought, cold, salt, wounding, UV radiation,
and pathogen attack [1]. It is ubiquitous in lower and
higher plants and has also been found in algae [2], fungi
[3], and even mammalian brain tissue [4].
Many studies have been carried out that characterize
ABA signaling pathways and physiological responses to
ABA in higher plants. Mutational analyses in Arabidopsis have led to the identification of several genes that

are involved in ABA signaling pathways. The proteins
involved in ABA signaling pathways include G proteins,
protein phosphatases, and protein kinases [5]. Target
proteins that respond to ABA can be directly involved
in cellular protection or can act as transcriptional factors that link extracellular signaling to the regulation of
transcription in eukaryotic cells an important part of the
physiological response to ABA is achieved through gene
expression and protein synthesis. Transcriptome analyses have shown that ABA dramatically alters gene
expression. More than 1300 ABA-regulated genes were
identified by random mass sequencing of Arabidopsis
transcripts [6,7]. Proteome research has also indicated
that exogenous ABA can induce the synthesis of many
proteins in rice seedlings. These proteins are involved in
signaling pathways, transcription, cell growth and division, photosynthesis, protein synthesis and trafficking,
and defense/stress-response, among others [8]. To date
however, relatively little is known regarding ABA signaling pathways in bryophytes.
Bryophytes were the first land plants and they have
been a powerful experimental tool and model for the
elucidation of complex biological processes [9-11]. Evolutionary studies have indicated that bryophytes may
form a sister clade with tracheophytes (vascular plants).
Analysis of organisms from these ancient clades can
make significant contributions to understanding the
development [12], physiology [13], phylogenetics [14]
and stress-induced cellular responses among plants [15].
Recently, comparison of the draft genome sequence of
P. patens with the genomes of flowering plants revealed
evolutionary insights into the conquest of land by plants.
Furthermore, bryophyte physiology is regulated by many
of the same phytohormones used by higher plants (e.g.,
auxins, abscisic acid, and gibberellins) and uses similar
mechanisms of intracellular messaging (e.g. Ca2+) found
in higher plants [13,16,17].
In recent years, the moss P. patens become a new
model for studying the phytohormone ABA. ABA is
involved in abiotic stress adaptation of P. patens, since
exogenously applied ABA increases freezing tolerance
[18] and increased endogenous ABA levels are detected
upon osmotic stress treatment [19]. Moreover, plants
like P. patens comprising both protonemata and gametophores will tolerate complete desiccation following
slow drying, if first pretreated with ABA, a process that
is associated with a substantial increase in intracellular
levels of sucrose [20] as is cold acclimation leading to
freezing tolerance [21]. ABA-induced stress tolerance in
P. patens is also accompanied by increased expression of
stress-related genes [6,7]. However, the role of ABA or
the signaling pathways in response to environmental
stresses in the moss P. patens has yet to be elucidated.

Here, proteomics has been used to increase understanding of ABA signaling pathways and defense
responses in P. patens. We have examined the global
changes of proteins in P. patens following ABA treatment using two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)
coupled with LC-MS/MS. Sixty-five proteins have been
identified as being up- or down-regulated in response to
ABA treatment. These proteins are involved in metabolism and energy, defense responses, protein trafficking
and storage, transcription, and signaling pathways, as
well as others. Our study reveals the complex signaling
pathways and defense responses by which ABA functions in P. patens. It also suggests that molecular
responses to ABA may be highly conserved between
higher plant species and bryophytes.

Results
Proteome profile changes in P. patens under ABA
treatment

Changes in the proteome profile between control and
ABA treated plants suggested that exogenous ABA
could trigger one or more responses in P. patens. In
order to ensure statistically results, the experiments
were carried out in triplicate. After CBB R-250 staining,
more than 1,300 protein spots could be detected for
each sample. Representative gels from control and ABAtreated plants and proteins showing altered abundance
are presented in Figure 1. Two-dimensional images were
analyzed using ImageMaster™ 2D Platinum software.
The volume percentage of each spot was estimated and
compared across the gels. In the samples following ABA
treatment, we repeatedly analyzed 89 protein spots,
whose relative abundance was at least 1.5-fold different
from the control. The proteins associated with 65 of
these protein spots were subsequently identified using
LC-MS/MS. Among them, 13 protein spots (D1-D13)
were down-regulated, 52 protein spots (U1-U52) were
up-regulated by ABA treatment including four protein
spots (U22, U24, U40, U43) which were only present in
the ABA-treated samples (Figure 1). Quantitative analysis indicated that the abundance of these proteins changed [see Additional File 1: Supplemental Table S1] in
response to ABA treatment (Figure 2) suggesting that
different physiological and biochemical processes are
modified following ABA treatment.
Protein identification by LC-MS/MS

The protein spots of interest were excised from preparative 2-D gels. After trypsin autolysis, the digested spots
were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The resulting amino acid
sequences were searched against databases using SEQEST software. As the P. patens sequence information is
limited, there were some samples that did not yield

signal transduction (6.7%), cell growth/division (4.4%),
transport (2.2%), and cytoskeleton (2.2%).
Within the material and energy metabolism category,
ATP synthase beta subunit (spot D3), putative protein 1
photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex (spot D4),
rubisco small subunit (spots D9, D13) and photosystem
assembly protein ycf3 (spot D12) were down-regulated,
and another nine proteins were up-regulated. All proteins within the defense category were up-regulated.
These proteins include putative proline-rich protein
(spot U15), putative expansin (spot U18), extensin-like
protein (spot U19), intracellular pathogenesis-related
protein-like protein (spot U24), disease resistance protein RPM1 (spot U29), lipoxygenase (spot U30), thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase (spot U33), 2-Cys
peroxiredoxin (spot U37), physcomitrin (spots U38,
U41), N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase-like protein (spot U42), putative ascorbate peroxidase (spots
U45, U46) and peroxiredoxin (spot U50). Proteins
involved in protein synthesis, degradation and folding
include different family members of the HSP70 family
(spots U7, U8, U9, U10, U11, U25, U35 and U52), chloroplast ftsH protease (spot D1) and cullin 3a (spot U27).
The up-regulated proteins probable Myb-family transcription factor (spot U2), fibrillarin-like protein (spot
U16), probable WRKY transcription factor 52 (spot
U22), bZIP transcription factor-like protein (spot U26)
and mRNA binding protein precursor-like (spot U44)
are all related to transcription. Some signal pathway
proteins were also up-regulated, including calciumdependent protein kinase-like protein (spot U4), ser/thr
specific protein kinase-like protein (spot U5) and putative receptor-like protein kinase (spot U14).

significant matches. For analysis of these samples, the
Arabidopsis database was used. Previous transcriptome
research has shown that the gene set in P. patens is very
similar to that of A. thaliana [22]. The results of the
database search are listed in Table 1 and Supplemental
Table S2 [see Additional File 2: Supplemental Table S2].
Functional categorization of ABA-responsive proteins

The ABA-responsive proteins could be sorted into eight
categories (Figure 3, Table 2) according to their biological function as described by the EU A. thaliana genome
project [23]. These categories include material and
energy metabolism (28.9%), defense (26.7%), protein

Discussion
In seed plants, the phytohormone ABA controls many
developmental and physiological processes via complicated signaling networks that are composed of receptors,
secondary messengers, protein kinase, and transcription
factors. Transcription factors can meditate protein
synthesis in responses to ABA, which is crucial in plant
growth and development as well as in plant responses
to various stresses. In this study, a broad spectrum of
proteins is synthesized following ABA treatment.
Detailed analysis of these proteins indicates that the
molecular responses to the plant hormone ABA appears
to be conserved among higher plant species and bryophytes, as discussed below.
ABA induced signaling proteins in P. patens

Receptor protein kinases (spot U14) are plasma membrane-bound and play an important role in the perception and transmittance of external signals such as ABA,

dehydration, high salt and cold treatments [24-26]. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) (spot U4) are
implicated as important sensors of Ca2+ flux in plants in
response to a variety of environmental stimuli and hormone signals. Depending upon the calcium signature,

the extent and duration of CDPK enzyme activation will
vary, but will have a direct effect on the phosphorylation
status of its downstream targets [27]. Ser/Thr specific
protein kinase (spot U5) catalyzes ATP-dependent phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on target

proteins [28]. Phosphorylation by protein kinases is one
of the most common and important regulatory mechanisms in signal transduction among all organisms [29].
These results suggested that these same proteins are
involved in the ABA signal transduction pathways of
P. patens, as reported in higher plants [6,7].
ABA activates the expression of transcriptional regulators

Transcriptional control is a major mechanism whereby
cells regulate gene expression. Sequence-specific DNAbinding transcriptional regulators, one class of transcription factors, play an essential role in modulating
the rate of transcription of specific target genes [30].
The bZIP transcription factors (spot U26) have been
shown to regulate diverse biological processes such as
pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, seed
maturation and flower development [31]. A group of
bZIP proteins have been identified as ABRE-binding
factors that activate transcription through this cis element [32]. Members of another large family of plant

transcription factors, the MYB proteins (spot U2), have
also been linked to plant stress responses, including
responses to UV light, wounding, anaerobic stress and
pathogens [33,34]. WRKY proteins (spot U22) are a
novel family of transcription factors that are unique to
plants [35]. The WRKY family contains one or two
highly conserved WRKY domains characterized by the
hallmark heptapeptide WRKYGOK and a zinc-finger
structure distinct from other known zinc-finger motifs.
Specific WRKY family members show enhanced
expression and/or DNA-binding activity following
induction by a range of pathogens, defense signals and
wounding. These transcriptional regulators have been
shown to induce stress-responsive gene expression and
protein synthesis and increase plant tolerance to biotic
and abiotic stresses in higher plants [36]. Our results
suggested that bryophytes, among the earliest land
plants, possessed mechanisms of ABA sensing and signal transduction required for stress responses, similar
to higher plants.

It is well known that Hsps are induced by ABA in higher
plants. Hsps/chaperones can play a crucial role in protecting plants against stress by reestablishing normal protein conformation and thus cellular homeostasis. Five
major families of Hsps are conservatively recognized: the
Hsp70 (DnaK) family; the chaperonins (GroEL and
Hsp60); the Hsp90 family; the Hsp100 (Clp) family; and
the small Hsp (sHsp) family [37]. The Hsp70 family
(spots U7, U8, U9, U10, U11, U25, U35, U52) represents
the most highly conserved of the HSPs, with functional
counterparts found in the most primitive of bacteria and
the most sophisticated of higher organisms [38]. HSP70 s
are involved in almost every step of protein biogenesis
[39]. They play essential roles as molecular chaperones
assisting the correct folding of nascent polypeptide chains
as they emerge from the ribosome, participating in transmembrane protein transport, and limiting cellular
damage following stress by their ability to prevent protein
aggregation and to restore the function of denatured proteins [40,41]. Luminal binding protein (BiP) (spot U35) is
a member of the Hsp70 family that is localized to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells, where it
functions as a chaperone and is believed to support
proper protein folding and protein translocation into the
ER lumen [42]. HSP is a large protein family that includes
HSP90 and HSP60, among others. In our study, different
members of Hsp70 subfamily were the major HSPs that
were up-regulated by ABA treatment in P. patens.

As in higher plants, many defense proteins were upregulated by ABA signal. In this study, we identified
twelve proteins related to defense and cellular protection. Intracellular pathogenesis-related proteins (spot
U24) are defined as proteins that are induced by pathogens attack as well as abiotic stimuli. They are powerful
defense agents that are currently being use to genetically
enhance cereals susceptible to endemic disease and
insect pests [43]. In order to combat pathogen infection,
plants also produce disease resistance protein (spot
U29) that specifically detects the appearance of avirulence products. If they lack corresponding disease

Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:192
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/192

resistance proteins, avirulence products can function as
virulence factors, subverting host cellular functions
through interactions with plant-encoded pathogenicity
targets [44]. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) (spot U30) catalyze
the formation of fatty acid hydroperoxides involved in
response to stresses such as pathogen attack, wounding,
water deficit, and anoxia [45]. N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyl transferase (HCBT) (spot U42) catalyses a reaction
in the phytoalexin biosynthetic pathway in carnation
[46]. Extensin (spots U18, U19) is a hydroxyproline-rich
glycoprotein (HRGP) found in the cell walls of higher
plants [47]. It is induced by many stimuli such as jasmonic acid, wounding and pathogen attack and appears to
play an important part in the plant defense response
[48,49]. Proline-rich proteins (spot U15) are also cell
wall proteins that actively contribute to the plant
defense response [50]. Enzymes involved in antioxidation include ascorbate peroxidase (spots U33, U45,
U46), which catalyses the first reaction between H2O2
and ascorbate in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, giving
rise to monohydroascorbate and H2O [51]; and peroxiredoxin (spots. U37, U50), which reduces H 2 O 2 and
detoxifies alkyl hydroperoxides and peroxinitrite [52].
Physcomitrin (spots U38, U41) is a novel plant cytolysin
but its biological function is not clear. It is significantly
induced by ABA treatment, NaCl, and desiccation
[53,54]. and is required Further study is required to
determine whether physcomitrin makes a significant
contribution in response to extreme environmental conditions in P. patens. The identification of a large number
of defense proteins implies that ABA could increase the
resistance of P. patens towards pathogens and abiotic
stresses, protecting the plant from oxidative damage.
ABA inhibits photosynthesis in P. Patens

Proteins involved in photosynthesis and carbon assimilation that responded to ABA treatment are represented
by the small subunit of Rubisco (spots D9, D13); photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex proteins (spot D4),
that catalyze acid-base reactions or that are involved in
proton uptake and release [55]; photosystem assembly
protein ycf3 (spot D12), which regulates the assembly of
photosystem complex proteins. Down-regulation of
these proteins suggests that photosynthesis may be
inhibited by ABA in P. patens. These results were in
accord with previous data which showed ABA inhibits
photosynthesis in higher plant [8]. Together, our results
indicated that ABA-responsive bryophytes underwent
physiological changes that had features similar to those
of higher plants.

with seed plants. Therefore, a process common to land
plants, such as responding to the plant phytohormone
ABA, can be worthwhile to study in the moss species,
P. patens. In order to investigate global protein changes
after treatment with ABA, we have performed a comparative proteome analysis of P. patens and revealed a
complex regulatory network. Upon the application of
ABA, P. patens cells can sense ABA and transmit a signal, which, in turn, activates transcriptional factormediated metabolic and defensive genes expression. In
higher plants, a broad spectrum of genes is also induced
by the ABA treatment, and these genes encode not only
proteins involved in the protection of cellular structures
or in the biosynthesis of protective metabolites but also
key regulatory proteins that induce stress-responsive
gene expression and protein synthesis and increase plant
tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. These responses
are similar to those seen in the moss P. patens in
response to ABA. Figure 4 illustrates the ABA response
process of angiosperm (A. thaliana; from reference 6, 7)
and bryophyte (P. patens). Based on these results, it
seems likely that P. patens and higher plants share common receptor protein, protein kinases, transcription factors and physiological and biochemical reactions.

Methods
Plant materials

P. patens was grown in modified BCD medium containing 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 0.75% (w/v) agar [56]. Gametophores were cultured under the standard conditions
(23°C) with a light cycle of 16 h light/8 h darkness and
a light intensity of 55 μmol s -1 m -2 . Three-week-old
gametophores were treated with 0 μM or 50 μM ABA
for 72 h. For ABA treatment, gametophores were transferred to BCD solid medium supplemented with 50 μM
(±)-cis-trans ABA. This treatment was carried out three
separate times [57]. Gametophores were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
Chemicals

IPG Drystrip, IPG buffer (pH 3-10), TEMED, ammonium persulfate, acrylamide, SDS and Bis were purchased from GE Healthcare BIO-Science (Uppsala,
Sweden); CHAPS, urea, thiourea, iodoacetamide, ammonium bicarbonate, trypsin were purchased from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO, USA); DTT and glycine were purchased
from Amresco (Solon, OH, USA); ZipTipC 18P™ pipette
tips were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA,
USA).
Protein extraction and 2-DE

Conclusions
Mosses were one of the earliest land plants in evolutionary terms, and have many characteristics in common

Proteins were extracted using a phenol extraction procedure [54]. The resulting pellets were dissolved in a sample buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS,

Figure 4 Comparison of the ABA response processes of A. thaliana (Angiosperm) and P. patens (Bryophyte). ABA signals are perceived
by receptor protein kinases and transduced through signaling intermediates to the calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and Ser/Thr
specific protein kinase, etc. Activated protein kinases phosphorylate and thus activate transcription factors. Subsequently, transcription factors
(bZIP factors, MYB, and WRKY, etc) mediate gene expression and protein synthesis in response to ABA treatment. They share three major
physiological and biochemical reactions: increase of respiration and defenses, and inhibition of photosynthesis.

0.5% (v/v) IPG buffer, 1% (w/v) DTT) at room temperature. 2-D electrophoresis was carried out according to
Bjellquist et al. [58]. Dry IPG strips (13 cm long, pH 4-7
linear) were rehydrated for 12 h in 250 μl rehydration
buffer containing 800 μg protein samples. Isoelectric
focusing was conducted at 20°C with an Ettan IPGphor
system (GE Healthcare Amersham Bioscience, Little
Chalfont, UK). Focusing was performed and focused
strips were then equilibrated as described previously
[54]. For the second dimension, the proteins were separated on 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Gels were
stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) R-250
in 25% ethanol/8% acetic acid and destained in 25%
ethanol/8% acetic acid.
Image and data analysis

The 2-DE gels were scanned at 600 dpi with a UMAX
Power Look 2100XL scanner (Maxium Tech Inc., Taiwan, China). The transparency mode was used to obtain
a grayscale image. The image analysis was performed
with ImageMaster™ 2D Platinum software. To verify the

auto detected results, all spots were manually inspected
and edited as necessary. After spot detection, quantification, and background subtraction, each analyzed gel was
matched individually to the reference gel. To compensate for subtle differences in sample loading, gel staining, and destaining, the volume of each spot (i.e. spot
abundance) was normalized as a relative volume. Only
those with reproducible changes (quantitative changes
more than 1.5-fold in abundance and t- test P < 0.05)
among three replicates were used for further analysis.
In-gel digestion and protein identification

Protein spots were manually excised from the gel. In-gel
digestion by trypsin and LC-MS/MS were performed
according to Wang et al. [54]. All MS/MS samples were
analyzed using the TurboSEQUEST program in the BioWorks 3.1 software suite (Thermo), against a database
adapted from P. patens and A. thaliana NCBI protein
database, in which each genuine protein sequence was
followed by a reversed amino acid sequence. The search
parameters included, up to two missed trypsin cleavages

Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:192
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/192

with carboxamidomethylation at cysteine. The mass tolerance for precursor ions and fragment ions were considered as 2 amu and 1 amu respectively. Peptides had
to be fully tryptically digested and be at least seven
amino acids long in the searched databases. The output
results were combined together using the software
BuildSummary. False positive rate (FPR) was kept less
than 5% as the filtration criterion. The FPR was calculated as double of the number of peptides from reversed
database divided by the number of peptides from
reversed and normal database [59]. An accepted
SEQUEST result had a ΔCn score of at least 0.1 (regardless of charge state). Peptides with a +1 charge state
were accepted if they were fully tryptic digested and had
a cross correlation (Xcorr) of at least 1.9. Peptides with
a +2 charge state were accepted if they had an Xcorr
≥2.2. Peptides with a +3 charge state were accepted if
they had an Xcorr ≥3.75.
