Abstract
Background: Despite the launch of the national plan for measles elimination, in Italy, immunization coverage
remains suboptimal and outbreaks continue to occur. Two measles outbreaks, occurred in Lazio region during
2006-2007, were investigated to identify sources of infection, transmission routes, and assess operational
implications for elimination of the disease.
Methods: Data were obtained from several sources, the routine infectious diseases surveillance system, field
epidemiological investigations, and molecular genotyping of virus by the national reference laboratory.
Results: Overall 449 cases were reported, sustained by two different stereotypes overlapping for few months.
Serotype D4 was likely imported from Romania by a Roma/Sinti family and subsequently spread to the rest of the
population. Serotype B3 was responsible for the second outbreak which started in a secondary school. Pockets of
low vaccine coverage individuals (Roma/Sinti communities, high school students) facilitated the reintroduction of
serotypes not endemic in Italy and facilitated the measles infection to spread.
Conclusions: Communities with low vaccine coverage represent a more serious public health threat than do
sporadic susceptible individuals. The successful elimination of measles will require additional efforts to immunize
low vaccine coverage population groups, including hard-to-reach individuals, adolescents, and young adults. An
enhanced surveillance systems, which includes viral genotyping to document chains of transmission, is an essential
tool for evaluating strategy to control and eliminate measles.

Background
The World Health Organization Regional Office for
Europe (WHO/EURO) has set 2010 as the target for
elimination of measles in the region [1,2]. This objective
has already been achieved in some States through routine immunization programmes which maintain high
coverage using a two-dose measles-mumps-rubella
(MMR) vaccine schedule [3]. However, vaccination coverage still remains inadequate in several western European countries, including Italy, and although mass

vaccination has successfully lowered the incidence of the
disease outbreaks continue to occur, often affecting
communities with low vaccination coverage [4].
In Italy, measles vaccine (MV) was introduced in 1976
and routine administration of one dose of measles vaccine to all children aged ≥15 months was recommended
since 1979. Combined MMR vaccines became available
in the early 1990s and the two-dose schedule (first dose
at 12-15 months and second dose at 5-6 or 11-12 years)
was introduced in 1999 [5]. However, despite the existence of national recommendations, responsibility for
implementation of measles vaccination activities lies
within each of Italy’s 21 regions. This has contributed to
non uniform coverage across regions, with lower rates

observed mainly in central and southern regions (including Lazio) with respect to northern regions [6].
In the years 2002-2003 a large measles outbreak
occurred in Italy with over 100,000 estimated cases
among children below 15 years of age [7]. Following the
outbreak, in November 2003, all 21 Italian regions
signed an agreement with the Italian Ministry of Health
to implement the “National Plan for the Elimination of
Measles and Congenital Rubella” [8]. Strategies include
among others, improving routine MMR coverage among
children below 2 years of age, implementing supplementary vaccination activities for older children and adolescents (aged 6-13 years) and strengthening disease
surveillance. Following implementation of the elimination plan, national vaccination coverage for first MMR
dose in children at two years of age increased from
82.0% in 2003, to 89.6% in 2007. During the same period of time, incidence of measles in Italy decreased from
22.6/100,000 to <1/100,000 [4,9].
In the Lazio region, the measles elimination plan succeeded in increasing coverage for the first dose of MMR
among children at two years of age from 83.9% in 2003
to 90.7% in 2007 [10]. During the same five year period,
coverage among school-aged children (6-13 years of
age) increased from 53% to 67% while coverage for the
second dose at 15 years of age increased from 14% to
42%. In 2004 and 2005 a historically low incidence of <
1 case per 100,000 was reached in the Lazio region, with
approximately 50 measles cases reported per year. However, sporadic cases continued to be reported, especially
among susceptible adolescent and adults. Pockets of
low coverage were also present in specific areas and
among emarginated and hard-to-reach populations
(HRP), such as the Roma/Sinti population, and illegal
immigrants [11].
Between June 2006 and August 2007, two measles
outbreaks occurred in the Lazio region. The first outbreak (June-December 2006) initially involved the
Roma/Sinti population, and subsequently spread to the
rest of the population. The second outbreak overlapped
with the first (October 2006-August 2007) and affected
mainly the Italian adolescent and adult population. In
this article we describe the two outbreaks and highlight
the importance of pockets of low vaccine coverage in
sustaining such outbreaks. Data from the mandatory
infectious diseases surveillance system, field epidemiological investigations, and molecular characterization of
measles virus by the national reference laboratory are
presented.

urban area of the capital city of Rome. It is divided into
5 provinces (Rome, Rieti, Viterbo, Latina and Frosinone)
and 12 Local Health Units (LHUs).
Data collection and case definition

The Public Health Agency of the Lazio Region (Agenzia
di Sanita’ Pubblica, ASP), is responsible for surveillance
of infectious diseases and immunisation coverage in the
region. The ASP monitored the two measles outbreaks
and coordinated outbreak control activities in the 12
LHUs of the region.
In Italy, measles is a disease subject to mandatory
notification, and according to the routine procedure,
physicians must report suspected measles cases to their
LHU within 48 hours of diagnosis. The local health
authorities then report confirmed measles cases to the
ASP monthly. At the beginning of the outbreaks this
procedure was modified and physicians were asked to
report suspected measles cases to both the local health
authorities and ASP offices within 24 hours of diagnosis.
Personnel of the LHUs performed epidemiological investigation of suspected cases including laboratory investigation and contact tracing.
A suspected measles case was defined as a subject
with fever (≥38°C), generalised rash and at least one of
the following symptoms: cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis.
A confirmed case was defined either as a laboratory
confirmed case (in which measles-specific IgM antibodies were present in serum or saliva samples or measles
virus nucleic acid was detected in urine samples by PCR
or as a case with an epidemiological link to a confirmed
case.
For each confirmed case, demographic data characteristics (including whether cases belonged to a Roma/Sinti
community), vaccination history, date of onset of symptoms, and hospitalisation, were collected. Information
was conveyed to the ASP, which discarded non confirmed cases from the database, eliminated redundant
records, performed quality check and contacted the
local health authorities for any missing information. To
assess presence of indigenous transmission or sources of
imported virus the data set was integrated with information provided by the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS), which conducted viral
molecular characterization from urine samples of
measles cases, utilising the PCR technique [12]. Data
analysis regarding the age distribution and immunization status of cases, as well as the percentage of cases
requiring hospital admission was performed on the total
number of cases reported in the two outbreaks.

reconstructions were performed with MEGA software
version 4.0 [13]. Virus isolates and genotypes were
designated according to the new official WHO nomenclature [14].
Data management

Data from confirmed cases was entered into Microsoft
Excel and converted to SAS version 8 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC) for analysis. The temporal and geographical distribution of cases, together with the age distribution, was calculated separately for the Roma/Sinti and
rest of the population.
Ethics

The present study did not require approval from an
Ethics Committee. Laziosanità - the public health agency
of the Lazio Region is the local government agency
responsible for the collection of infectious disease notifications, hospital admission and discharge records and
laboratory surveillance data. The management of these
data for public health purposes does not require a
patient’s informed consent nor does it require any
authorization regarding privacy laws.

Results
From June 2006 to the end of August 2007, a total of
449 cases were reported, of which 302 in 2006 and 147
in 2007. The two outbreaks overlapped and not all cases
were genotyped; therefore, it was not possible to determine the exact number of cases that occurred in each of
the two outbreaks. Overall, 347/449 cases occurred
amongst the Italian ethnic population and 102/449
amongst the Roma/Sinti population. Seventy-eight cases
(17%) were laboratory confirmed while the remaining
were epi-linked. The virus serotype was identified
for fifty-seven cases (Serotype D4: n = 32; serotype
B3: n = 25).
Description of outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (June-December 2006)

The first reported case was an eight year-old Roma child
of Romanian nationality, living in a settlement located in
the outskirts of Rome. The child was admitted to hospital with rash, fever, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and
otitis on 28 June 2006, reporting onset of symptoms on
24 June 2006. Analysis of routine data allowed the identification of an additional case that had been notified
one week previously, in Rome by a different LHU. This
case was an unvaccinated six-year-old Roma child, also
of Romanian nationality, who developed symptoms on
16 June 2006. The child was not hospitalised and the
source of his infection was not determined, since his
parents refused to answer to questioning by the health
officials and then moved away. He transmitted the

Page 3 of 9

infection to an eight-year-old child living in the same
building, who developed symptoms on 1 July 2006 and
was hospitalised. In the last week of June two additional
Roma/Sinti children, in two different health authorities,
developed measles symptoms on 23 June and 24 June
respectively. By the end of July in Rome, an additional
25 measles cases had been reported in various settlements of the Roma/Sinti community and 16 cases
among the rest of population. Two cases among the Italian ethnic population, who developed symptoms on 19
and 20 July, reported contact with Roma/Sinti patients
with measles in a hospital waiting area, on 4 and 10 July
2006 respectively.
As of the end of November 2006, 98 cases had been
reported in the Roma/Sinti community from 19 settlements in Rome. Approximately half of these cases (50/
98) were of Romanian nationality. No further cases
among the Roma/Sinti population were reported after
November 2006. At the same time, a total of 204 cases
were reported among the general population in Rome,
from July to December 2006 (Figure 1).
Outbreak 2 (October 2006 - August 2007)

In November 2006, a cluster of six measles cases was
reported amongst adolescents and young adults attending a professional school in the outskirts of Rome
(attack rate 0.7%). The infection subsequently spread
outside the school and cases continued to be reported
amongst the Italian ethnic population until the summer
2007. This second outbreak reached a peak in March
2007 and was considered over only in August 2007 (Figure 1). During July-August 2007 three measles cases
were notified per month, bringing the incidence level to
that reported in the Lazio region before the described
outbreaks (≤4 cases per month, or <1/100,000 population per year).
Molecular Characterization

The D4 genotype, grouped in two different clusters of
common origin, was responsible for the first cases
reported in the Roma/Sinti population and detected in
several other cases, including the Italian ethnic population, up to December 2006. Starting in October 2006
the B3 genotype was isolated in a contact of a case from
the school outbreak, overlapping for some time with
genotype D4 (Figure 1).
Geographical distribution of the outbreaks in Lazio region

The first outbreak (D4) started in the RM-B LHU (Figure 2). Cases were subsequently reported in a different
area of Rome (RM-D) with numerous Roma/Sinti settlements. These two areas were the most affected by the
outbreak while a more limited number of cases were
reported in the remaining three health districts of the
city of Rome (RM-A, RM-C, RM-E). Districts outside
the urban area of Rome reported only sporadic cases,
with the exception of district RM-H in the south of

Rome, where the outbreak in the professional school
occurred. (Figure 2).
Age distribution of the cases

Overall, the median age of cases was 11 years. Children
aged 0-4 years were the most affected age group, with
one third (152/449) of cases reported belonging to this
age group (76/100,000 incidence for children <5 years).
Measles incidence in the total population during the two
outbreaks was 9/100,000. When analysed separately, the
age distribution of measles cases was different among the
Roma/Sinti population (median age two years) with
respect to the rest of the population (median age
15 years). Seventy percent (72/102) of Roma/Sinti cases
occurred in children aged 0-4 years and over 90% (93/
102) were aged below 15 years. The age distribution of
cases in the Italian ethnic population was more evenly
distributed among all age groups. Only 23% of cases (80/
347) were aged 0-4 years, and less than 50% (170/347)
occurred in children below 15 years of age (Figure 3).
Immunization status, hospital admission, and nosocomial
transmission

None of the Roma/Sinti cases were vaccinated against
measles, and only 16 (5.5%) cases from the Italian ethnic
population had received one dose of measles-containing
vaccine. Overall, over 57% (258/449) of cases required
hospital admission. Fifteen cases (3.3%), 12 of whom

from the first outbreak and three from the second,
reported a hospital contact with children affected by
measles, either in the waiting area or after admission for
a different condition. Four of these contacts were
healthcare professionals (two nurses and two physicians). Out of the 15 reported cases of nosocomial
transmission, seven involved contacts with Roma/Sinti
children, including the first two cases in the Italian ethnic population.
Control measures

In response to the described clusters of measles cases,
active tracing and vaccination of susceptible contacts
was performed by local health authorities. A second
dose of MMR vaccine was also offered to incompletely
vaccinated contacts. In addition, MMR vaccine was
offered to all susceptible or incompletely vaccinated
children and adolescents attending any of the schools in
which cases had been detected and to Roma/Sinti children up to 5 years of age. Vaccination sessions were
conducted directly in the involved settlements; in total
493 persons in seven settlements were vaccinated in
August 2006. Isolation of cases and susceptible contacts
(in hospital for Roma/Sinti patients and at home for
other subjects) was recommended,
Local health authorities were urged to identify possible
contacts of all suspected measles cases, and alert general

practitioners, family paediatricians, and hospitals about
the outbreaks. Physicians were asked to report cases
within 24 hours of diagnosis. In addition, guidelines
regarding respiratory isolation of patients with suspected
measles, and vaccination of susceptible hospital staff
were forwarded to all hospitals of the region. Before the
start of the 2006/07 school year a meeting was organized by the ASP with staff in charge of the measles
elimination campaign and the public health departments
of the 12 health authorities. Local media were also
informed of the outbreaks.

Discussion
The two described outbreaks, which involved 449 cases
(incidence 9/100,000) notified from June 2006 to August
2007, represent the most serious episodes after the
2002-2003 measles outbreak [7]. They confirmed that
pockets of low vaccination coverage exist in some areas
of the Lazio region, particularly among Roma/Sinti communities and adolescents
Thanks to relatively high immunisation rates amongst
new born children (90,7%) [10] and the work done by
the local health authorities, conducting contact investigation of cases’, vaccination of susceptible school and
household contacts, and implementing isolation measures, the outbreaks did not affect the whole region and,
in the city of Rome, was mainly limited to a few peripheral districts (Figure 2). Both outbreaks started in populations known to have low coverage, (Roma/Sinti
community, and students of a secondary school). The
subsequent spread to the rest of the population, at least
for the first outbreak, was facilitated by nosocomial
transmission.
Differences were found in the affected age groups
among the Roma/Sinti and the rest of population. As
expected in a susceptible population, the most affected
age group in the Roma/Sinti population was the 1-4
year-old age group. Conversely, in the Italian ethnic
population, which had a higher percentage of vaccinated
subjects with respect to the Roma/Sinti population,
especially among young children, most cases occurred
in the 15-19 year-old age-group.
Molecular characterization of measles virus is an
important surveillance tool for monitoring measles elimination [15,16]. In this case it was fundamental in tracing the origin of both outbreaks and showing that two
distinct chains of transmission took place in the region.
It is highly likely that the first outbreak, due to the D4
measles serotype, which is not endemic in Italy [12],
was imported from Romania. In fact, first cases occurred
in families of Romanian nationality with family and
social links in Romania. In addition, the D4 sequence
identified among the first cases in Lazio was found to
be identical to the D4 isolated in Romania during the

Page 6 of 9

2004-2006 outbreak [17] in which over 4000 cases and
10 deaths occurred [18].
A D4 measles strain highly correlated with the one isolated in Lazio caused a smaller outbreak in northern Italy
(South Tyrol), between 21 June and 11 August 2006 [19].
The first case was reported during the same week of the
beginning of the first outbreak in Lazio, and 13 of 17
cases belonged to the Roma/Sinti population. In South
Tyrol, a transit camp for Roma/Sinti travelling between
Italy and Eastern Europe appeared to be the entry point
for the D4 measles genotype in Italy (Figure 4).
Between August 2006 and February 2007 other
measles outbreaks linked to the Lazio outbreak (D4)
occurred in Sardinia (Italy) and Barcelona (Spain), both
affecting mainly Roma/Sinti communities. In Sardinia,
nine cases, all aged below 15 years and three of which
laboratory confirmed, with genotype D4 isolated, were
reported from a Roma/Sinti settlement in the town of
Alghero, between 12 August and 3 September 2006
[19]. Four of the children had travelled to Rome from 3
to 14 August 2006, to attend a funeral. In the Barcelona
region (Spain) an outbreak occurred from October 2006
to February 2007. The first case, a six-year-old girl of
Eastern European origin had attended a family gathering
in Italy with her mother where other guests may also
have had measles. Genotype D4 was identified [20] confirming the link with the outbreak in Lazio (Figure 4).
Genotype D4 was no longer isolated after the end of
2006, being replaced by B3 genotype starting in October
2006. Despite an accurate epidemiological investigation,
the origin of this genotype was not identified. B3 is not
considered endemic in Italy and is most frequently
detected in Sub-Saharan Africa, although transmission
of this virus within Europe has been reported. The isolated B3 was similar, but not identical, to the strain circulating in UK in 2005 [12]. This serotype was first
identified in Lazio and subsequently introduced in Puglia (Figure 4), a region of South Italy, where it was
responsible for an outbreak from November 2006 to
January 2007 [21].
The percentage of cases which required hospitalisation
during the two outbreaks in Lazio was high (57%). This
can be partly explained by the well known underreporting of cases by general practitioners and paediatricians,
as compared to hospital physicians. The number of
cases requiring hospitalisation, especially during JulySeptember 2006, was sufficiently high to create problems to the hospital system. The inadequate number of
isolation beds in hospitals may represent a serious problem in case of occurrence of an epidemic due to a
more aggressive infective agent, such as SARS or pandemic flu.
Measles nosocomial transmission has been recently
documented in several other outbreaks in Italy and

other European countries [22-25] and the public health
importance of nosocomial measles transmission has
been established in many situations.
The 15 cases reported in this paper represent only 3%
of the total number of cases and therefore did not contribute significantly to the measles incidence during the
outbreak. However, these cases most likely represent an
underestimate of the real number of infections that
occurred through hospital contacts and nosocomial
transmission. It is likely that isolation measures and
separate admission procedures were not always adopted
in case of admission of a patient with signs and symptoms compatible with measles. In the first outbreak,
nosocomial transmission may have been responsible for
the spread of the infection from the Roma/Sinti to the
Italian population. Also of concern is the fact that four
healthcare professionals developed measles. As the incidence of measles declines, nosocomial transmission is
likely to become an important source of infection and
sustain the occurrence of outbreaks among non-immunised health staff and hospital contacts, representing a

serious problem in the elimination of measles [26]. Strategies to minimize nosocomial spread of infection
should become a priority for control and effectively
implemented in the future.

Conclusions
The described outbreaks highlight the threat represented
by pockets of susceptible populations, even in the presence of good coverage levels in the overall population
[27]. These groups include hard-to-reach populations
(HRP) such as the Roma/Sinti communities (estimated
MMR coverage in Italy below 10%,) [11], families who
refuse vaccination for ideological or religious reasons, as
reported in recent outbreaks amongst students in private religious schools and orthodox communities in Europe and Israel [28-30], and families objecting to having
their children vaccinated out of concern for vaccinerelated adverse events [31-33]. The risk for the community represented by HRP or organized groups of objectors should not be underestimated and represent a more
serious treat than sporadic susceptible individuals.

Curtale et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/62

Susceptible population groups may reintroduce indigenous measles virus transmission even in countries confirmed as disease-free or in a population with high
immunization coverage [34] facilitating the transmission
of the disease to susceptible individuals still present in
the region.
Efforts are needed to improve methods to identify
areas with low coverage and to develop specific strategies which target susceptible groups. An improvement
in health services delivery may be needed to reach
Roma/Sinti communities and new immigrants. At the
same time, more effective communication strategies
should be defined to address subjects objecting to vaccination either for religious or other reasons, involving
these subjects in a wider discussion on their responsibility toward the community. The implementation of catch
up campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults
should also be considered, with the additional objective
of protecting women of childbearing age against rubella.
