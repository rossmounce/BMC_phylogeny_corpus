Abstract
Background: CITED proteins belong to a family of non-DNA-binding transcriptional coregulators that are characterized by a conserved ED-rich domain at the C-terminus. This family of
genes is involved in the regulation of a variety of transcriptional responses through interactions
with the CBP/p300 integrators and various transcription factors. In fish, very little is known about
the expression and functions of CITEDs.
Results: We have characterized two closely related but distinct CITED3 genes, gcCited3a and
gcCited3b, from the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp. The deduced gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b proteins
share 72% amino acid identity, and are highly similar to the CITED3 proteins of both chicken and
Xenopus. Northern blot analysis indicates that the mRNA expression of gcCited3a and gcCited3b is
strongly induced by hypoxia in the kidney and liver, respectively. Luciferase reporter assays
demonstrated that both gene promoters are activated by gcHIF-1. Further, ChIP assays comparing
normal and hypoxic conditions reveal differential in vivo binding of gcHIF-1 to both gene promoters
in kidney and liver tissues. HRE-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that both gcCITED3a and
gcCITED3b proteins inhibit gcHIF-1 transcriptional activity, and GST pull-down assays confirmed
that both proteins bind specifically to the CH1 domain of the grass carp p300 protein.
Conclusion: The grass carp gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b genes are differentially expressed and
regulated in different fish organs in response to hypoxic stress. This is the first report
demonstrating in vivo regulation of two closely-related CITED3 isogenes by HIF-1, as well as
CITED3 regulation of HIF-1 transcriptional activity in fish. Overall, our findings suggest that unique
molecular mechanisms operate through these two gcCITED3 isoforms that likely play an important
regulatory role in the hypoxic response in the grass carp.

Background
Cells and tissues respond to low oxygen levels by stabilizing the HIF-1 transcription factor, which controls the
expression of over 100 different genes that are involved in
adaptation and survival [1]. These include genes involved
in erythropoiesis (e.g. EPO), vasculogenesis (e.g. VEGF),
glucose metabolism (e.g. GLUT1 and GLUT4), and fibrogenesis. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric DNA-binding protein
composed of an oxygen-sensitive HIF-1α subunit and a
constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit (also known as
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, or
ARNT) [2]. In the presence of oxygen, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by a prolyl hydroxylase [3]. This triggers its interaction with the pVHL protein, which targets HIF-1α for
degradation by the 26S proteosome [4]. In the absence of
oxygen, prolyl hydroxylase activity is inhibited. This
results in the stabilization of HIF-1α and the subsequent
translocation of the HIF-1α subunit into the nucleus
where it binds HIF-1β and forms transcriptionally active
HIF-1. HIF-1 regulates gene expression by interacting with
sequence-specific hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs)
found in either the 5'-flanking, 3'-flanking, or intronic
regions of HIF-responsive genes. The HRE was first identified as a 256-bp sequence in the 3'-flanking region of the
human EPO gene [5].
The CITED [cAMP-responsive element-binding protein
(CBP)/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid/
aspartic acid-rich tail] proteins belong to a family of transcriptional cofactors that is characterized by a conserved
ED-rich domain at the C-terminus. The biological properties of CITED proteins include modulating a variety of cellular and developmental processes [6,7] and responding
to diverse biological [8] and environmental stimuli
[9,10]. To date, four different CITED homologs have been
reported in vertebrates. CITED2, which can function as an
activator and a repressor depending on the tissue, is the
most extensively studied of the four. In the initial description, CITED2 was shown to function as a repressor of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) through competition
for binding to the CH1 domain of CBP/p300 [11]. The
LPXL (Leu-Pro-X-Leu) motifs in both CITED2 and HIF-1α
interact with overlapping binding sites on the CH1
domain of p300 [12]. CITED2 has been reported to bind
this same region with 33-fold greater affinity than HIF-1α
[9]. Genetic evidence indicates that loss of CITED2 is associated with increased activation of HIF-1 target genes [13],
supporting the hypothesis that CITED2 is a negative regulator of HIF-1α. Conversely, CITED2 functions as a coactivator for several transcription factors, such as AP-2
[14], PPAR-α, and PPAR-γ [15], by linking them to CBP/
p300. Cellular responses to TGF-β are largely mediated by
the Smad proteins, which serve as both transcription factors and transcriptional co-regulators. CITED2 is an
important regulator of TGF-β signaling through direct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/101

association with Smad2 and Smad3 [16]. Members of the
CITED protein family may also play an important role in
the regulation of reproductive functions. Studies have
shown that CITED2 interacts with the LIM domain of the
Lhx2 transcription factor to enhance transcription of the
glycoprotein α-subunit gene [17]. Furthermore, CITED1
has been shown to bind to the estrogen receptor ER-α and
enhance the transcription of estrogen-inducible genes
such as TGF-α [7].
CITED3 is the least studied member of the CITED family.
Previous studies have shown that it is highly expressed
during the early stages of embryonic development in the
mesonephric tubules and eye in the chicken [18], the
pronephros and eye in the frog [19], and the kidney of
adult grass carp [20]. While much is known about the distribution and regulation of the CITED proteins in mammals, very little is known about these proteins in fish. Fish
are ideal models to study molecular and cellular adaptation to hypoxia, as fluctuations in environmental oxygen
availability have played an important role in the evolution of these animals [21]. The expression patterns and
functions of the CITED proteins remain largely unknown
in cyprinids. Our group has previously reported the presence of a hypoxia-responsive CITED3 cDNA in grass carp
[20]. In an attempt to gain broader insights into the evolution and possible functions of the different CITED genes
in fish, this study describes our findings on two closelyrelated but distinct CITED3 homologs - gcCITED3a and
gcCITED3b - from the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp. We
present evidence for a differential role of these two
gcCITED3 genes for adaptation to hypoxia in grass carp
based on their in vivo mRNA expression and response pattern to short- and long-term hypoxia, as well as in vitro
gene transactivation studies.

Results
Identification of two CITED3 genes in grass carp
We have previously described a full-length CITED3 cDNA
from grass carp that shows high similarity to chicken and
Xenopus CITED3 [20]. In this study, degenerate primers,
targeting consensus sequences derived from a multiple
alignment of the CITED3 open reading frames (ORFs) of
grass carp [GenBank: AY225852], zebrafish [GenBank:
AF359242], chicken [GenBank: AF261079] and Xenopus
[GenBank: AI031460], were used for RT-PCR on total
RNA extracted from the kidney of a grass carp that was
exposed to hypoxia for 4 h. A distinct cDNA fragment,
cix1 (0.7 kb), with a partial ORF that shared high
sequence identity with the grass carp CITED3 ORF was
identified. Using 5'- and 3'-RACE PCR, a 3032-bp fulllength cDNA, CIX1, was obtained. DNA sequencing
showed that CIX1 contains 5'- and 3'-untranslated (UT)
regions of 122 bp and 2187 bp, respectively, and an ORF
(723 bp) that specifies a protein of 240 amino acids with

a predicted molecular weight of 26.3 kDa. In agreement
with this finding, a single mRNA transcript of approximately 3.0 kb was detected by Northern blot (data not
shown). A pairwise sequence comparison demonstrated
that CIX1 shares particularly high similarity with the
CITED3 proteins of grass carp (72%); zebrafish (69.4%);
and chicken (64.1%), but only moderate similarity (42 49%) with the CITED2 protein, and low similarity
(<42%) with the CITED1 and CITED4 proteins from different vertebrate species. Moreover, the primary structure
of the CIX1 and grass carp gcCITED3 [GenBank:
AAO48505] proteins contain the characteristic CR1, CR2,
and CR3 domains that are highly similar to the homologous domains present in the chicken and Xenopus CITED3
proteins (Figure 1). Taken together, these data strongly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/101

suggest that CIX1 is a novel CITED3-like homolog. We
refer to this gene as gcCited3b, and the previously
described gcCITED3 as gcCited3a [20]. This designation
was chosen since the primary sequences and structures of
these two homologs are most similar to known CITED3
proteins. The nucleotide sequence data of gcCited3a and
gcCited3b have been deposited in the GenBank database
as GenBank: AY225852 and GenBank: EU450668, respectively.

medaka (Oryzias latipes), marine medaka (Oryzias
melastigma) and Fugu (Fugu rubripes) indicated extensive
sequence similarity in the CR1, CR2, and CR3 domains
(Figure 1). CR2 is the characteristic domain of the CITED
protein family and is present in all known CITED proteins. Notably, a particularly high degree of sequence conservation is observed in the core CR2 motif, which is
known to interact with the CH1 domain of the p300/CBP
co-transactivator [12]. Importantly, a glutamine and histidine-rich (QH-rich) region (amino acid positions 95 - 131
in gcCITED3a) is found only in the CITED3a and
CITED3b homologs in fish but is absent in the chicken
and Xenopus CITED3 (Figure 1), and mammalian CITED1,
CITED2, and CITED4 proteins (data not shown). In addition, a leucine-rich nuclear-export signal (LMSLVVELGL),
which presumably contributes to the sub-cellular localization of the CITED proteins [22], is also conserved within
the CR2 domain of all the fish CITED3a and CITED3b
proteins.
Phylogeny of fish CITED3a and CITED3b proteins
In silico screens of the zebrafish, Japanese medaka, Fugu
genome and/or EST and NCBI GenBank databases identified a number of fish homologs that share substantial
sequence similarity with the gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b
proteins. Similar screens of various mammalian databases
with CITED3, CITED3a, or CITED3b failed to identify any
CITED3-like sequences, suggesting that these genes are
absent in mammals. The phylogenetic relationship
between different CITED3 proteins was analyzed by the
neighbor-joining method using fish CITED1 proteins as
the outgroup (see Table 1). As shown in Figure 2, CITED3
proteins are separated with high bootstrap support into
three different sub-clades: fish-specific CITED3a and
CITED3b, and avian/Xenopus CITED3.
In vivo mRNA expression and response patterns of
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b to short- and long-term
hypoxia
To examine the in vivo expression pattern of gcCited3a and
gcCited3b in response to hypoxia, grass carp (n = 3) were
exposed to normoxia (7.0 mg O2/l) and hypoxia (0.5 mg
O2/l) for 4 h and 96 h. Total RNA was isolated from six
different tissues (brain, gill, heart, kidney, liver, and muscle) of each fish at each time point for Northern blot analysis. Overall, the normoxic mRNA expression and hypoxic
induction pattern of the gcCited3a and gcCited3b genes in
different grass carp tissues were consistent between all
three replicate blots, and a representative autoradiogram
is shown in Figure 3. Under normoxic conditions,
gcCited3a (1.6-kb mRNA) expression was detected in all
tissues examined except muscle. After 4 h of hypoxia, a
significant induction of gcCited3a was observed in the kidney, and a mild induction was identified in the gill and
liver. The brain, heart, and muscle tissues showed no
change in the expression of gcCited3a. After 96 h of

hypoxia, a marked induction of expression was observed
in the kidney and liver, a modest induction was detected
in the heart, and no change in gcCited3a expression was
observed in the brain, gill, or muscle.
Under normoxic conditions, gcCited3b mRNA expression
was also detected in all tissues examined except the muscle, and the highest level was detected in the kidney and
liver. After 4 h of hypoxia, gcCited3b mRNA expression
was induced in all tissues except the muscle. The highest
induction was observed in the kidney and liver. After 96 h
of hypoxia, the induction of gcCited3b expression was
detected in the brain, gill, heart, and kidney.
In all replicates of each hypoxic tissue, the mRNA expression level of gcCited3a and gcCited3b was normalized
against the 28S rRNA and compared to their normoxic
counterparts. If the expression level following hypoxia
was equal to the normoxia control group, the
hypoxia:normoxia expression ratio should be equal to
one. In contrast, this ratio is expected to be significantly
greater than one in the case of hypoxic induction of the
genes. The 4 h and 96 h datasets for each tissue were combined and a non-parametric χ2 test was performed to
examine the significance of the induction. The analysis
indicated that the expression of both gcCited3a and
gcCited3b was significantly different in the kidney and

Northern blot analysis of gcCited3a and gcCited3b.
Fish tissues (brain, gill, heart, kidney, liver, and muscle) were
isolated from normoxic (N) and hypoxic (H) grass carp following 4 h and 96 h of exposure as indicated. Total RNA
from each tissue was isolated and analyzed by Northern
hybridization using gene-specific probes for gcCITED3a and
gcCITED3b. Ethidium bromide-stained 28S rRNA is shown as
the loading control. A representative Northern blot derived
from the tissues of one normoxic and one hypoxic fish (from
a total of three in each group) is shown here.

Activation of gcCited3a and gcCited3b promoter activity
by gcHIF-1 in CHO cells
To investigate whether gcHIF-1 regulates the gcCited3a
and gcCited3b gene promoters, Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells were transiently transfected with the
pCITED3a(-1817/+30) or pCITED3b(-1713/+76) luciferase construct, together with pBK-CMV-gcHIF1α [23], or
the empty pBK-CMV expression vector. As shown in Figure 4, luciferase activity was strongly activated in CHO
cells co-transfected with pCITED3a(-1826/+30) and the
pBK-CMV-gcHIF-1α (ca. 3.2-fold), while cells similarly
transfected with pCITED3b(-1731/+76) exhibited an even
greater HIF-1-induction (ca. 15-fold), when compared to
control cells transfected with the empty pGL3-Basic vector
(p < 0.05). Interestingly, promoter sequence analysis
revealed the presence of a single core HRE (CGTG) at position -59/-56 of the 5'-flanking region of the gcCited3a gene
(Figure 5A), while two putative HREs in the reverse DNA
strand (CACG) were detected at -629/-626 and -510/-507
of the gcCited3b gene (Figure 5B).

At the time of the study, no functional HRE had been
reported in fish, and the binding of the HIF-1 transcription factor to consensus and non-consensus HREs had
only been speculated [24]. In order to determine whether
the gcHIF1 binds to the gcCited3a and gcCited3b promoters in vivo, ChIP assays were performed on grass carp kid-

ney and liver tissues using PCR primer sets that spanned
four overlapping regions (ca. 500 bp each) within the 5'flanking sequences of the gcCited3a and gcCited3b genes.
Under normoxic conditions, gcHIF-1 did not bind to the
gcCited3a promoter; however gcHIF-1 binding was
detected in region 4 (nucleotide position -616/+30) of the
gcCited3a promoter (which contains a single core HRE at
-59/-56) in kidney and liver tissues of fish exposed to 4 h
of hypoxia (Figure 5A). These data demonstrate that
gcHIF-1 formed a specific complex at the gcCited3a promoter in vivo. In contrast, three different gcHIF-1 binding
patterns were observed at the gcCited3b promoter following ChIP: specific gcHIF-1 binding was detected at nucleotide positions -1731/-1136 (region 1) and -1257/-742
(region 2), neither of which contain a consensus or core
HRE sequence, in the kidney of hypoxic fish, but not in
normoxic kidney (Figure 5B). Additionally, gcHIF-1 binding was detected in region 2 of gcCited3b in the liver of
both normoxic and hypoxic fish. Finally, gcHIF-1 binding
was specifically detected at nucleotide position -760/-283
(region 3, which contains two core HRE motifs in the
reverse orientation) in the liver of hypoxic fish.
Inhibition of gcHIF-1 transactivation of HRE-luciferase
activity by gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b
Previous work has demonstrated that the human CITED2
and CITED4 proteins are capable of competing with HIF-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/101

1 for specific binding to the CH1 domain of CBP/p300
and repressing the transcription of HIF-1 regulated genes
[11,14]. To test whether gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b
could also inhibit the transactivation activity of gcHIF-1,
CHO cells were co-transfected with pBK-CMV-gcHIF1α
and pBK-CMV-gcARNT2b, with or without pCMVgcCITED3a or pCMV-gcCITED3b, together with the luciferase reporter construct pSV40-EpoHRE-Luc, which contains four copies of the HRE from the human EPO gene
[25]. As shown in Figure 6, the gcHIF-1-mediated transactivation of HRE-luciferase activity in CHO cells was
reduced significantly (ca. -40%) in the presence of
gcCITED3a or gcCITED3b (p < 0.05). The CR2 domains of
CITED2 and CITED4 have been shown to be involved in
the inhibition of HIF-1 transcriptional activity in humans
[11,26]. To determine whether the CR2 domain of
gcCITED3a/gcCITED3b is required for the inhibition of
gcHIF-1 activity, CHO cells were transfected with pBKCMV-gcHIF1α and pBK-CMV-gcARNT2b, together with
pCMV-gcCITED3aΔCR2 or
pCMV-gcCITED3bΔCR2
(deletion mutants lacking the CR2 domain) expression
vectors. No significant reduction in gcHIF-1 transactivation of HRE-luciferase activity was observed in the presence of either of these two CR2-deletion derivatives
(Figure 6), indicating that the negative regulatory effect of
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b on gcHIF-1 is dependent
upon the CR2 domain of these proteins. Next, to determine whether the inhibition of the gcHIF-1-mediated
transactivation of HRE-luciferase activity may be due to
reduced synthesis of gcHIF-1α caused by ectopic expression of gcCITED3a or gcCITED3b, Western blot analysis
was performed using an anti-gcHIF-1α antibody [23].
CHO cells transfected with pBK-CMV-gcHIF-1α alone or
co-transfected with pCMV-gcCITED3a or pCMVgcCITED3b contained comparable levels of the gcHIF-1α
protein (data not shown), which indicated that the
decrease in gcHIF-1 transcriptional activity in the presence
of gcCITED3a/gcCITED3b is not due to reduced gcHIF-1
synthesis.
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b physically interact with CBP/
p300
Since gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b have been shown to
repress the transcriptional activity of gcHIF-1 (presumably
via competition for the CBP/p300 co-transactivator), we
used immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays to
determine whether these proteins can directly interact
with CBP/p300. CHO cells were transfected with pGFPgcCITED3a, pGFP-CITED3b, pGFP-gcCITED3aΔCR2 or
pGFP-CITED3bΔCR2, and whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz). Western blot analysis of the anti-CBP
immunoprecipitates using an anti-GFP antibody (Santa
Cruz) (Figure 7A) demonstrated that both gcCITED3a and
gcCITED3b co-immunoprecipitate with the endogenous

reporter and pSV-β-gal vector (control for transfection efficiency) along with pBK-CMV-gcHIF-1α and pBK-CMVgcARNT2b or empty pCMV-TNT vector. Wild-type pCMVgcCITED3a or deletion mutant plasmid pCMVgcCITED3aΔCR2 (panel A); or pCMV-gcCITED3b or deletion mutant plasmid pCMV-gcCITED3bΔCR2 (panel B) was
also co-transfected with pBK-CMV-gcHIF-1α. Relative luciferase activity is the ratio of luciferase over β-galactosidase
activity. Transfections were performed in triplicates and data

CBP/p300 proteins in the CHO cells. This result suggests
that both proteins are capable of physically interacting
with CBP/p300. Since the interaction of human CITED2
and CITED4 with CBP/p300 has been shown to be
dependent on the CR2 domain [11,26], we deleted this
domain in gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b. Interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation was also observed between the
mutant GFP-gcCITED3aΔCR2 and GFP-gcCITED3bΔCR2
proteins and CBP/p300, while GFP alone did not show
any interaction. Taken together, these results indicate that,

pGFP-CITED3bΔCR2, and whole cell lysates prepared and
immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz).
The immunoprecipitates were resolved on 12% denaturing

protein fused to gc-p300/CH1 (CH1 domain of grass carp
p300) was purified from bacterial culture and immobilized on
glutathione-Sepharose beads. In-vitro-transcribed and -translated [35S]-methionine-labeled gcCITED3 or gcCITED3ΔCR2
was incubated with purified GST-fused CH1 or GST alone as
indicated in the figure.

unlike hCITED2 and hCITED4, the CR2 domain in
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b is not required for physical
interaction of the proteins with CBP/p300.
Using GST-pull down assays, we next determined whether
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b physically bind to the CH1
domain of the grass carp p300 protein. The CH1 domain
of grass carp p300 (gc-p300/CH1) [GenBank: EU450671]
was amplified using degenerate primers and subcloned
into the pGEX-5X-2 vector (Promega). GST and GST-gcp300/CH1 fusion proteins were incubated with in-vitrotranscribed and -translated [35S] methionine-labeled
gcCITED proteins, followed by fractionation on SDSPAGE. As shown in Figure 7B, only the wild-type

gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b proteins, but not the
gcCITED3aΔCR2 or gcCITED3bΔCR2 deletion derivatives, were pulled down by the GST-gc-p300/CH1 fusion
protein, demonstrating that the CR2 domain facilitates
specific binding of both gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b to
the CH1 domain of CBP/p300.

Discussion
CITED3 is the least studied member of the CITED family,
and the molecular targets and specific mechanisms underlying the action of CITED3 have not yet been clearly identified. In this study, we have characterized two closelyrelated CITED3 genes - gcCited3a and gcCited3b - in the
hypoxia-tolerant grass carp, and in silico analyses demonstrated that these two CITED homologs are present only in
the genomes of fish and are absent in mammals. Whilst
we were able to recently identify CITED2 cDNAs from
zebrafish and grass carp (unpublished observations), bioinformatic searches of all available fish genomes with various mammalian CITED4 proteins failed to turn up any
CITED4-like sequences, which suggested that Cited4 genes
are likely absent in fish. Interestingly, parsimony analysis
of CITED proteins from diverse animal species has previously indicated that fish CITED3 proteins are most closely
related to the mammalian CITED4 [20]. This raises the
possibility that CITED3 and CITED4 are likely orthologous proteins that may have arisen subsequent to lineage
divergence between mammalian and non-mammalian
vertebrates, and that CITED3a and CITED3b have
descended from a gene duplication event in fish from an
ancestral CITED3 gene.
We have shown that the gcCited3a and gcCited3b genes are
transcriptionally up-regulated by the gcHIF-1 transcription factor (Figure 4), and the gene products, in turn,
repress gcHIF-1 transcriptional activity at the molecular
level (Figure 6). As gcCited3a and gcCited3b are differentially activated transcriptionally by hypoxia in certain fish
tissues (Figure 3), our results suggest that gcCITED3a/
gcCITED3b may serve to auto-regulate the HIF transcriptional response in hypoxic cells of the corresponding tissues.
Interestingly,
gene
transfection
studies
demonstrated that gcHIF-1 transcriptional activity was
inhibited by ectopic expression of the wild-type
gcCITED3a/gcCITED3b,
but
not
the
mutant
gcCITED3aΔCR2 or gcCITED3bΔCR2 proteins, which
provided compelling evidence that the observed inhibition of HIF-1 activity is mediated by the CR2 domains of
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b. While GST pull-down assays
demonstrated that the CR2 domains of gcCITED3a and
gcCITED3b are indeed required for specific binding of the
proteins to the CH1 domain of the CBP/p300 co-transactivator (Figure 7B), co-immunoprecipitation experiments
showed that gcCITED3a, gcCITED3b, and the corresponding ΔCR2 mutant proteins could all physically interact

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/101

with the endogenous CBP/p300 in CHO cells (Figure 7A).
These results are consistent with the notion that both
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b can physically interact with
CBP/p300 at multiple sites apart from the respective CR2
and CH1 domains of these proteins, and the functional
implications of which await further investigations. To our
knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating physical
interaction of CITED3 proteins with p300, and that
CITED3 can negatively regulate HIF-1 transcriptional
activity in a manner similar to the mammalian CITED2
and CITED4 proteins [11,27], which require their CR2
domains to exert this function.
In vivo regulation of the gcCited3a and gcCited3b genes by
HIF-1 in the kidney and liver tissues of hypoxic fish was
confirmed by ChIP-PCR assays, which revealed that
endogenous gcHIF-1α is recruited to the gcCited3a promoter at region 4 (which contains a single core HRE at 59/-56) (Figure 5A). In contrast, three different ChIP patterns were observed with the gcCited3b promoter. Most
notably, gcHIF-1 binding was detected in gcCited3b in the
kidney of hypoxic fish (but not normoxic kidney) at
regions 1 (nt positions -1731/-1136) and 2 (nt positions
-1257/-742); neither of which contains any consensus
HRE sequence (Figure 5B). These observations are not surprising as it has been previously shown that HIF-1 is
expressed in many organs in mammals [28] and fish [29],
albeit at varying levels, under both normoxic and hypoxic
conditions. What was surprising, however, was the binding of gcHIF-1 to two HRE-less regions in gcCited3b. A
closer inspection of the ChIP-positive regions of the
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b promoters also failed to identify any sequence motifs that resemble the non-canonical
HRE sequence (GATGTG) recently reported in killifish
[30]. Indeed, the binding of HIFs to gene promoters that
lack the consensus HRE motif (NRCGTG) have been
reported recently for human HIF-1 and HIF-2 using ChIP
[31], whereby the binding of transcription factors to promoter regions lacking the consensus recognition sequence
may be attributed to the formation of higher order DNA/
protein complexes [31-33].
Experiments are currently underway in our lab to further
explore the selectivity of HIF-1 binding to DNA that lacks
the consensus HRE motif, 5'-RCGTG-3'. Notwithstanding,
our findings in this study indicate that the gcCited3a and
gcCited3b genes interact differentially under normoxia
and hypoxia with gcHIF-1 in kidney and liver tissues, presumably via different sets of distal enhancer binding proteins to achieve differential gene expression.
Northern blot analysis revealed that both gcCited3a and
gcCited3b are ubiquitously expressed in all fish tissues
examined, except muscle (Figure 3). Although they share
a similar overall mRNA expression pattern, the predomi-

nant expression sites of gcCited3a and gcCited3b are the
kidney and liver, respectively. This raises the question of
whether these two genes have independent or partially
redundant functions in these tissues. The major structural
difference of these two homologs with other CITED subtypes is the presence of a QH-rich domain in both
gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b, which may contribute to
functional differences. In addition to their known
involvement in the regulation of HIF-1 signaling, a growing body of evidence indicates that the CITED proteins
can interact with a variety of signaling molecules, suggesting that these proteins may have a role in diverse cellular
processes. For example, while CITED1 is able to activate
Smad4-dependent transcription, it has also been shown
to repress the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which
regulates early nephronic patterning in vertebrates [34].
CITED2, on the other hand, interacts with Smad2 and
Smad3 to induce expression of the matrix metalloproteinase 9 gene in TGF-β-mediated tumor cell invasion [16]. In
addition, CITED2 and CITED4, along with some isoforms
of the transcription factor AP2, have been shown to activate genes that may be involved in neural crest, neural
tube, and cardiac development [14,35]. Moreover,
CITED1 and CITED2 were shown to interact with ER-α
and PPAR-α, respectively, to activate the transcription of
target genes [7,15]. Overall, based on the phenotypes of
their gene knockouts and their interactions with many different and important developmental signaling pathways,
it appears that members of the CITED family are versatile
transcriptional cofactors or effector molecules. These
genes likely engage in diverse cellular and developmental
processes/functions and serve to fine-tune a number of
signaling pathways to mediate their ultimate biological
functions.
All known interactions between CITED proteins and various other transcription factors are bridged by the common transcriptional cofactor CBP/p300. This cofactor is
required to mediate either the transcriptional gene activation or repression mechanisms of the CITED proteins.
During gene activation, CITED proteins interact with
CBP/p300 via the CR2 domain to form a transcription
complex along with other transcription factors, such as
Smad3, Smad4, or AP2A, B, or C [14,16,35-37]. This complex induces the transcription of specific target genes.
Conversely, during gene repression, CITED proteins may
compete with specific transcription factors, such as HIF1α or β-catenin [11,26,34], for a common binding site on
the CBP/p300 protein. This binding diminishes the transactivation activity of the latter transcription factors. Based
on the studies of mammalian CITED genes, with which
the grass carp CITED proteins share significant sequence
homology (in particular the CR2 domain), and the ability
to bind CBP/p300, it is likely that the gcCITED proteins
may interact with the equivalent transcription factors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/101

described in mammalian systems to regulate similar cellular processes in fish.
Both the gcCited3a and gcCited3b genes can be transactivated by subjecting fish to both short- and long-term
exposure to low oxygen tension. Long-term exposure led
to a dramatic over-expression of both gcCited3a and
gcCited3b in specific tissues, suggesting that certain processes in these tissues require gcCITED3a or gcCITED3b or
that the CITED3a or CITED3b proteins directly alleviate
the effect of hypoxia. The gene responses to hypoxia by
other members of the CITED family, and their roles in
development, indicate that these proteins may be responsible for controlling gene transcription during tissue
development, which may be driven by slight hypoxia in
the developing tissues [38].

Conclusion
Taken together, gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b genes are differentially expressed and regulated in different fish organs
in response to hypoxic stress. Both genes are activated by
gcHIF-1 in gene transfection studies, and ChIP assays
comparing normal and hypoxic conditions reveal differential in vivo binding of gcHIF-1 to both gene promoters
in kidney and liver tissues. HRE-luciferase reporter assays
showed that both gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b proteins
inhibit gcHIF-1 transcriptional activity, presumably by
binding specifically to the CH1 domain of the grass carp
p300 protein as confirmed by GST pull-down assays.

Methods
Fish Culture and Treatment
Animal care and experimentation were undertaken in
accordance with City University of Hong Kong animal
care guidelines. Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) of ca.
500 g body weight were obtained from a fish hatchery in
Panyu, Guangdong, China and maintained in 300-l fiberglass tanks with circulating, filtered and well-aerated water
at 20 ± 1°C under a 12:12 h day:night cycle. Fishes were
reared under normoxia (7.0 ± 0.2 mg O2/l) or hypoxia
(0.5 ± 0.3 mg O2/l) for 4 and 96 h in a continuous flow
system as previously described [39]. Dissolved oxygen
(DO) was monitored continuously using a YSI Model 580
dissolved oxygen meter (Geo Scientific Inc., Canada).
After the exposure period, the fishes were anaesthetized
and tissues were immediately dissected out, snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until ready to be
processed.
RNA Isolation and Cloning of Full-length cDNAs
Total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using the PolyATtract mRNA Isolation System III kit (Promega, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning of

the full-length gcCITED3a cDNA sequence has been previously reported by our group [20]. To facilitate cloning of
the full-length gcCITED3b cDNA, 5'- and 3'-RACE PCR
were performed using the Marathon Amplification Kit
(Clontech, USA). Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg kidney poly(A)+ RNA of hypoxic fish using
the cDNA Synthesis Primer and AMV reverse transcriptase.
Second-strand cDNA was generated in an enzymatic reaction containing DNA polymerase I, DNA ligase, and
RNase H from E.coli. Double-stranded cDNA was bluntended with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated to Marathon
cDNA Adaptor. For 5'-RACE, adaptor-ligated ds-cDNA
was used as the template in PCR amplification using adaptor primer AP1 and antisense gene-specific primer 5' GSP1
(5'-CCACCACTTATCTGGCCGTTGACCT-3'),
derived
from the partial gcCITED3b cDNA sequence. Nested PCR
was performed using nested adaptor primer AP2, and
gene-specific primer 5' GSP2 (5'-ACGCCATTCATCACGTTCCTCTGCC-3'). For 3'-RACE, PCR amplification of the
ds-cDNA was performed with primer AP1 and gene-specific primer 3' GSP1 (5'-CCTTACAGCATCTCAGCAGCTTATGGC-3'). Nested PCR was performed with AP2 and
gene-specific primer 3' GSP2 (5'-CACAGAATGGGTCCTGCTCAGTTGG-3'). The full-length gcCITED3b cDNA was
cloned by RT-PCR using forward and reverse primers targeting the 5'- and 3'-RACE products, respectively, with Pfu
DNA polymerase (Promega). The PCR profile consisted
of: denaturation at 95°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles
of 95°C for 1 min, 60°C for 30 s and 73°C for 3 min; and
a final extension step at 73°C for 5 min. The full-length
cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Preparation of Reporter Constructs and Expression
Vectors
The 5'-flanking sequences of gcCited3a and gcCited3b were
obtained using the GenomeWalker Universal Kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly,
2.5 μg grass carp genomic DNA was digested separately
with the restriction enzymes DraI, EcoRV, PvuII or StuI.
GenomeWalker Adaptor was ligated to the purified DNA
and ligation products were subjected to two rounds of
PCR (primary and secondary PCR) using the Advantage
Genomic Polymerase Mix (Clontech). The touch-down
PCR profiles for primary and secondary PCR consisted of
denaturation at 94°C for 2 min followed by 5 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 30 s and annealing at 68°C for
30 s, and 25 cycles of annealing at 65°C for 30 s and
extension at 68°C for 3 min. This is followed by a final
extension at 68°C for 5 min. Primers CITED3a-F (5'GTGTCTCAATCTAGTGAGCTGCCTACC-3') or CITED3bF
(5'-CAGTTGAAGCTCTGCGTAGCAATACTGTTC-3')
and AP1 were used in primary PCR, while primers
CITED3a-R
(5'-CGGCAGGACAATTGAGCTTTATCTGTTC-3') or CITED3b-R (5'-GGTCCAGCCTTCTCGTTATCACAGCT-3') and AP2 were used in the secondary PCR.

Amplification products were purified and cloned into
plasmid vectors for DNA sequencing. The gcCITED3a
(1817 bp) and gcCITED3b (1713 bp) constructs used in
this study were cloned into the promoterless pGL3-Basic
luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). Vectors expressing
the grass carp HIF-1α (pBK-CMV-gcHIF-1α) and ARNT2b
(pBK-CMV-gcARNT2b) were constructed as previously
described [23]. Coding sequences for gcCITED3a,
gcCITED3b, the gcCITED3aΔCR2 and gcCITED3bΔCR2
deletion derivatives were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pCMV-TNT expression vector (Promega)
using standard procedures. The coding sequence of the
CH1 domain of the grass carp p300 protein was PCRamplified using gene-specific primers gcp3GST-F (5'GAGTATCGAATTCCTCAGCATGGGCAG-3'; XhoI site is
underlined) and gcp3GST-R (5'-TATCTCGAGTCACAGCATTCCCGGATG-3'; EcoRI site is underlined), and the
PCR product was subcloned into the XhoI/EcoRI sites of
the pGEX-5X-2 GST vector (GE Healthcare, USA) to yield
pGST-gcCH1. GFP-tagged gcCITED3a, gcCITED3b,
gcCITED3aΔCR2 and gcCITED3bΔCR2 proteins were produced by subcloning the ORF of the corresponding
cDNAs into the pCMV-GFP expression vector (Stratagene,
USA).
Northern Hybridization Analysis
Total RNA (13.5 μg) was electrophoresed on 1% (w/v)
agarose/formaldehyde gel in 1× MOPS buffer (20 mM
MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA) and
blotted onto Hybond-XL membrane (GE Healthcare).
Blots were prehybridized at 65°C for 30 min in
ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) and Northern hybridization carried out at 65°C for 2 h in the same solution containing 2.0 × 106 cpm/ml of [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA
probe prepared by random priming (GE Healthcare).
Blots were washed thrice in 2× standard sodium citrate
(SSC), 0.05% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) for
10 min at room temperature, and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1%
SDS (w/v) for 20 min at 50°C. Blots were exposed on a
phosphor screen (Kodak, USA) at room temperature for
20 h, and the signals were captured and quantified using
the Molecular Imager FX System (Bio-Rad, USA). A 115bp 28S rDNA fragment (and confirmed by DNA sequencing) was amplified from grass carp total DNA using primers 28S-F (5'-GATCCTTCGATGTCGGCTCT-3') and 28S-R
(5'-CTAACCTGTCTCACGACGGT-3') and used as an
internal control probe in Northern hybridization for normalization of gene expression.
Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays
CHO cells (kind gift from Professor Peter Ratcliffe of the
Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics, Oxford University, UK) were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells
per well and transfected with 120 ng of p(HRE)4-Luc
reporter plasmid and 60 ng of pSVβ-Gal expression vector

(Promega) using LipofectAMINE 2000® transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM® I reduced serum medium
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The
p(HRE)4-Luc reporter plasmid consists of 4 copies of the
human erythropoietin hypoxia-responsive element
(HRE) linked to the SV40 promoter and firefly luciferase
gene (a gift from Professor Yoshiaki Fujii-Kuriyama, the
Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance and the
Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Tsukuba,
Japan). Ectopic expression of gcHIFα involved cotransfection of 120 ng of pBK-CMV-gcHIF-1α or an equimolar
amount of the empty pBK-CMV vector with the luciferase
and β-Gal reporter plasmids in the presence of 120 ng of
pBK-CMV-gcARNT2b. The total DNA used in each transfection was adjusted to 1 μg by adding appropriate
amount of pcDNA3 vector. Approximately 24 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and luciferase activity
was measured using the Bright-Glo™ Luciferase assay kit
(Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity to
correct for variations in transfection efficiency. The relative luciferase activity of the pGL3-Basic vector was set at
1.0 RLU for each data set. Data are expressed as means ±
S.D. from three independent experiments with three replicates per sample in each experiment.
Co-immunoprecipitation Assay
CHO cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 10 μg of pCMVGFP or pCMV-GFP-gcCITED3a, pCMV-GFP-gcCITED3b,
pCMV-GFP-gcCITED3aΔCR2
or
pCMV-GFPgcCITED3bΔCR2. Twenty hours post-transfection, the
cells were washed in ice-cold 1× PBS buffer and lysed in
0.5 ml TNTE buffer at 4°C. Cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-CBP/p300 antibody (Santa
Cruz, USA) and then incubated with Protein A/G agarose
(Santa Cruz) at 4°C for 1 hour. Unbound proteins were
removed by washing with TNTE buffer and bound proteins were denatured by boiling in SDS-PAGE buffer followed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibody
(diluted 1:5000, B-2, Santa Cruz).
Western Blot Analysis
GFP-fusion proteins were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE,
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad),
blocked in 4% non-fat dry milk in 0.1% TPBS (0.1%
Tween 20 in 0.1 M Na2HPO4, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.5 M
NaCl pH 7.2) for 30 min, and the membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-GFP antibody B-2
(diluted 1:5000; Santa Cruz) in the blocking medium.
Non-specific binding of antibody was washed off with
three changes of 0.1% TPBS followed by detection with
1:5000 diluted HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse
IgG (Zymed, USA) at room temperature for 1 h using the
ECL Plus Detection System (GE Healthcare). Western blot
detection of gcHIF-1α and β-tubulin proteins was carried
out as previously described [23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/101

Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull-down Assay
GST-fusion proteins (or GST alone) were induced in E. coli
DH5α for 30 min in 10 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed and GST-fusion proteins were prebound with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose
beads. The beads were incubated with the in-vitro-transcribed and -translated [35S] methionine-labeled proteins
for 3 - 4 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with
washing buffer, and analyzed in 15% SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were visualized using the FX phosphoimaging
system (Bio-Rad).
In Vitro Translation
The pCMV-gcCITED3a, pCMV-gcCITED3b, pCMVgcCITED3aΔCR2 and pCMV-gcCITED3bΔCR2 plasmids
were transcribed in vitro and translated using the TNT T7
Quick
coupled
transcription/translation
system
(Promega) in the presence of [35S] methionine according
to the manufacturer's instructions. The translated proteins
were analyzed in 15% SDS-PAGE and images visualized
using the FX Phosphoimaging system (Bio-Rad).
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay
Five separate normoxia/hypoxia exposure experiments
were carried out, and for each, grass carp (ca. 2.5 kg each)
were acclimatized for one week in normoxic water and
then exposed to hypoxia (n = 2) or normoxia (n = 2) for
4 h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was
performed on kidney and liver tissues from these fish
according to the instructions of the ChIP assay kit
(Upstate, USA). Kidney (0.8 g) and liver (1.6 g) tissues
were fixed in 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at
room temperature for 15 min, and the cross-linking reaction was terminated with 125 mM glycine (SigmaAldrich) for 5 min. Tissues were homogenized using a
Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold PBS containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and then sonicated six times for 15 s each in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10
mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1× protease inhibitor
cocktail, and 1 mM PMSF) at 55% amplitude using a Cole
Palmer Ultrasonic Processor to generate DNA fragments
of 500 - 800 bp. For immunoprecipitation, a rabbit antigcHIF-1α polyclonal antibody AB-4 [23] was used. Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by PCR using primers
spaced 200 - 400 bps apart and encompassing regions that
contain putative hypoxia-responsive elements (or HREs)
within the gcCited3a and gcCited3b gene promoters (Figure 3). For the positive control (input), purified chromatin without the immunoprecipitation step was used for
PCR. The PCR profile consisted of 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 45 s, followed
by extension at 72°C for 1.5 min. PCR was performed in
a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of purified DNA,
0.2 mM dNTP, 0.2 μM each of forward and reverse primer,
1× PCR buffer and 0.3 U of Taq DNA polymerase.

Phylogenetic Analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed by maximum parsimony using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
(MEGA) Version 3.1 program http://www.megasoft
ware.net/. Evaluation of the inferred phylogeny was performed using the bootstrap test with 1000 replications.
Statistical Analysis
A non-parametric χ2 test was used to test the null hypothesis that the ratio of hypoxic:normoxic mRNA expression
level was not significantly different from 1 [40]. One-way
ANOVA was used to examine inhibitory effects of ectopic
expression of gcCITED3a and gcCITED3b on gcHIF-1α
induction on HRE-driven luciferase activity. Where significant effects were detected, Tukey's tests were performed to
identify significant difference between individual means;
α = 0.05 was used in all statistical tests.
