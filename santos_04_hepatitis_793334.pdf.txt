Abstract
Background: Lamivudine inhibits replication of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is commonly used as part of antiretroviral therapy. The main limitation
in the use of lamivudine is resistant mutation selection. Most of these mutations affect the YMDD
motif of the HBV DNA polymerase. The resistance occurs through M550V or M550I aminoacid
replacements. The M550V variation may be accompanied by L526M mutation, notably in HIV-HBV
co-infected patients. The aim of this study was to investigate mutations associated with lamivudine
resistance in a hemodialysis patient chronically co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, who was
submitted to several antiretroviral treatments.
Methods: HBV isolates derived from three blood samples collected at different times of
antiretroviral therapies with and without lamivudine, were titred and submitted to nucleotide
sequencing.
Results: HBV isolate derived from a sample collected in 1999 during an antiretroviral treatment
with lamivudine showed the lamivudine resistant double mutation (L526M, M550V). However, no
mutation associated with lamivudine resistance was observed in the HBV genome derived from the
sample collected during a period of treatment without lamivudine (2001). After reinstitution of
lamivudine (2002), the predominant HBV population exhibited a rare triple mutation (V519L,
L526M, M550V), which has previously been associated with an in vitro reduction of virus antigenicity
(escape mutant). HBV DNA was detected at high levels (108–109 copies/ml) in the three blood
samples.
Conclusions: Reintroduction of lamivudine as part of antiretroviral treatment in a patient who
had developed lamivudine resistant HBV strains favored the predominance of an HBV isolate with
reduced antigenicity. The absence of hepatitis acute exacerbation in this patient may be correlated
to the absence of significant variations of the viral load, which was independent of the presence of
mutations in the HBV DNA polymerase.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) share common routes of transmission, mainly
sexual, parenteral and vertical. Therefore, the prevalence
of HBV serological markers is higher among HIV infected
patients than in non-HIV infected individuals [1,2]. Considerable variations in the prevalence of HBV markers
have been observed in HIV patients according to the geographical region and risk of exposure [3]. Recently, a prevalence of 68% of antibodies against hepatitis B core
antigen (anti-HBc) was observed in HIV infected patients
living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [4]. Co-infection with HIV
interferes with the natural history of HBV infection and is
associated with higher HBV DNA levels [5,6]. A more
common progression to cirrhosis, despite a milder histological necro-inflammatory activity, has also been
observed in cases of HIV-HBV co-infection [5].
Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits the
reverse transcriptase activity of both HIV and HBV [7] and
is commonly used in the treatment of both viral infections
[8,9]. The HBV DNA loss due to lamivudine treatment is
usually accompanied by significant histological and biochemical improvement [10]. The major limitation in the
use of lamivudine is the selection of resistant mutations
that may arise and accumulate during therapy. Most of
these mutations usually affect the YMDD motif of the
HBV DNA polymerase, by replacement of a methionine
residue at position 550 with either valine (M550V) or isoleucine (M550I). Such mutations have notably been
reported in HIV-HBV co-infected patients [11,12] who
develop lamivudine resistance at an annual rate of 20%,
with a projected rate of 90% after four years of therapy
[13].
The consequences of drug resistance mutations for the
evolution of HBV induced liver disease are currently
under study. Hepatitis B acute exacerbation has been
described after withdrawal of lamivudine therapy [14].
Such an exacerbation has also been associated with the
appearance of YMDD mutants [14,15] and with a rapid
increase of viral load [16].
The present study was performed to characterize HBV variants and genetic patterns of lamivudine resistant HBV
strains in a patient co-infected with HIV-1 at different
periods of an antiretroviral treatment with and without
lamivudine.

Methods
Patient characteristics and serological markers
A 30-year-old male patient initiated a hemodialysis treatment in August 1995. At that time, he was negative for
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as well as for anti-HBc
and anti-HIV antibodies. The patient received three blood

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/4/29

transfusions during the first trimester of 1996 and developed a posttransfusional hepatitis. He became HBsAg and
anti-HIV positive and remained positive for both markers
in all routine tests performed between 1996 and 2002.
Data of other tests, such as serum transaminases, CD4 levels, and HIV load, performed in external laboratories
between 1995 and 2002, were available. Resistance to different HIV therapies was evaluated by the medical staff
based on HIV load and CD4 levels. HIV treatment started
in April 1996, with a combination of zidovudine (AZT)
and didanosine (ddI). In November 1996, this treatment
was modified to a combination of AZT and lamivudine
which was maintained until March 1997, when treatment
was once again changed to triple therapy with AZT, lamivudine and invirase. In May 1999, high HIV load (3.1 ×
105 copies/ml) was observed, indicating HIV resistance. At
that time the patient started an anti-tuberculosis treatment with rifampicin. However, due to interaction of
antiretroviral drugs with rifampicin, the administration of
antiretroviral drugs was discontinued. This resulted in a
decrease of CD4 counts to 156 cells/ml, while elevated
levels of HIV persisted at the end of 1999. Antiretroviral
treatment resumed in January 2000, composed of four
drugs, namely ddI, stavudine, nevirapine (NVP) and nelfinavir (NFV). As a consequence, CD4 cell counts increased
noticeably, and HIV RNA became undetectable. Unfortunately, resistance to therapy was observed during the second semester of 2001, when HIV load reached 1.2 × 105
copies/ml and CD4 counts decreased to 120 cells/ml. The
treatment was then replaced by another including lamivudine associated to AZT, NVP and NFV. No HIV resistance
was observed until the end of the follow-up (November
2002). The patient died of renal failure at the end of 2003.
DNA extraction and PCR assays for DNA sequencing
Three serum samples collected in March 1999, August
2000 and November 2002, were available for HBV DNA
analysis. Sera were submitted to DNA extraction by the
phenol-chloroform method after treatment with proteinase K, as described previously [17]. HBV pre-S/S genomic
region was amplified by PCR using sense primer PS1 (5'CCATATTCTTGGGAACAAGA-3', nt 2826-2845) and a
mix of antisense primers S2 (5'-GGGTTTAAATGTATACCCAAAGA-3', nt 841-819) and S22 (5'-GTATTTAAATGGATACCCACAGA-3', nt 841-819), able to amplify all
HBV genotypes. PCR assays were performed under the following conditions: 94°C, 30 s; 52°C, 1 min; 72°C, 2 min;
35 cycles, followed by a final elongation of 7 min at 72°C.
Amplification products (10 µL) were loaded on a 2% agarose gel, electrophoresed, stained with ethidium bromide,
and visualized under UV light.
Quantification of HBV DNA
Quantification of HBV DNA was performed by endpoint
dilution. DNA samples were diluted to a tenfold series up

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/4/29

to 10-8 dilution. Each dilution was submitted to PCR with
oligonucleotide pairs PS1–PS2, designed in the pre-S
region and C1–C2 (core region), as described previously
[4]. Serial dilutions and PCR assays for HBV DNA quantification were performed in triplicate. The sensitivity of the
method has been estimated to about 100 copies per PCR
reaction [18], equivalent to 104 HBV genome copies per
milliliter of serum. Quantitative results were estimated by
dividing 104 copies/ml by the last positive dilution.

ber 1996. HBV DNA was detected at high levels
(108copies/ml) in the blood sample collected in March
1999, during this first period of lamivudine treatment
(Figure 1). In May 1999, lamivudine was discontinued,
and the sample analyzed during the period of lamivudine
interruption (August 2001) showed the highest (109 copies/ml) HBV DNA titre mesured in this study. HBV DNA
was again detected at high levels (108copies/ml) after
reintroduction of lamivudine (November 2002, Figure 1).

Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing
Pre-S/S PCR products were cloned into pCRII plasmid vector using TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For
nucleotide sequencing, recombinant plasmid DNAs were
purified by a commercially available kit (Plasmid midi kit,
Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nucleotide sequences were
determined using the Cy5 auto read sequencing kit
(Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) with M13
universal and reverse primers, as well as internal, HBV
specific primers. For direct sequencing (S region), PCR
products were extracted from low melting agarose gels
(Qiaquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen). Sequencing reactions with HBV specific primers were done using the
thermo sequenase Cy5 dye terminator sequencing kit and
analyzed on an ALFexpress automated sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Independent plus and minus strand
sequencing was completed.

HBV variants
Nucleotide sequences of HBVs (pre-S/S region) derived
from HBsAg/HBeAg positive samples collected in March
1999, August 2001 and November 2002 were determined
(three clones each). Phylogenetic analysis showed that all
nine clones belonged to genotype A. This genotype has
been subdivided into two subgenomic groups, designated
A-A' (genotype A excluding A') and A' [20]. Recently, subgroups A-A' and A' were designated respectively as A1 and
A2 [21] or Ae and Aa [22]. Isolates belonging to subgroup
A' have been first identified in South Africa and circulate
in a high proportion among HBV Brazilian isolates [23].
As can be observed on the phylogenetic tree represented
in Figure 2, all clones belonged to subgroup A' and were
closely related to each other. The six clones obtained during the two periods of lamivudine treatment (1999 and
2002) clustered separately (with a bootstrap value of
86%) from those obtained in 2001, during the period of
lamivudine interruption.

Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using PILEUP (Wisconsin Sequences Analysis Package GCG, Madison, WI). A
phylogenetic tree was generated by neighbour-joining
analysis of genetic distances, using the TREECON software
package for Windows [19]. HBV sequences available from
the GenBank database (accession numbers AY090458,
M57663, U55220-U55222, J02201 and X51970) were
used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree.

Results
Markers of HBV infection
The patient under study developed an acute hepatitis and
became anti-HIV positive in 1996, soon after receiving
blood transfusions during the initial period of hemodialysis treatment. He became an HBV chronic carrier, with all
blood samples collected between 1996 and 2002 being
positive for HBsAg and HBeAg. During this period, the
patient remained asymptomatic without clinical signs for
HBV infection. Aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline
phosphatase levels remained normal all during the follow-up. However, an increase of alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels to 180 IU/L was observed in March 1999 (Figure 1).

HIV treatment started in April 1996. Lamivudine was
introduced as part of antiretroviral treatment in Novem-

Table 1 shows the main amino acid changes observed in
the S region of the genome. Two substitutions, H359Y in
the polymerase and Y100C in the surface antigen (small
S), were observed in all HBV sequences. These two
changes were natural variation, characteristics of the HBV
strain infecting the patient under study. All three clones
derived from the sample collected in 1999, during the first
lamivudine treatment, showed two lamivudine resistant
mutations (L526M and M550V), also detected in the
major viral population by direct sequencing. One clone
(1-B57) showed an additional mutation related to drug
resistance (V519L) that was not detected by direct
sequencing. None of these three mutations associated
with lamivudine resistance was observed in sequences
derived from the second sample (2001). In contrast, all
three clones derived from the third sample (2002)
showed the three lamivudine resistant mutations. However, by direct sequencing of PCR products of this last
sample, the electropherogram could detect two nucleotides (A and G) at the same sequence position indicating
a mixture of V519 and L519 residues. Curiously, all HBV
sequences obtained during the period without lamivudine treatment (2001) displayed a unique G473E substitution in the polymerase gene. Stop mutations were also
observed in the small S protein, which was truncated at

position 182 in clone 2-B14 and at position 216 in clone
2-B62 (Table 1).
Due to overlapping of polymerase and S genes on the HBV
genome, mutations at positions 473, 519 and 550 of the
polymerase were accompanied by mutations at positions
119, 164 and 195 of the small S protein (Table 1).

Discussion
Among lamivudine resistant mutations, those in the
YMDD motif of the HBV DNA polymerase are the most
common. The resistance occurs by replacement of a
methionine residue at position 550 by either valine
(M550V) or isoleucine (M550I). More rarely, HBV variant
presenting M550S replacement may be selected during
lamivudine treatment [24] The M550V variant may be
accompanied by a mutation (leucine to methionine) at
position 526 [25]. In the absence of HIV infection, the
mutation at position 550 alone has been found in up to

two-thirds of patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic
hepatitis B. However, more than 90% of HIV-HBV coinfected patients display the double lamivudine resistant
mutation at positions 526 and 550 [12]. Furthermore, the
presence of L526M mutation in addition to mutation at
position 550 seems to be associated with prolonged lamivudine treatment [26]. The double mutant has been
shown to exhibit a 15-fold decrease of the in vitro susceptibility to lamivudine [27], since each mutation contributes to the loss of lamivudine sensitivity [28]. It is
believed that the L526M mutation, when not accompanied with a mutation in the YMDD motif, does not confer
lamivudine resistance [29]. Even so, the L526M mutation
has been found alone in patients under lamivudine therapy [30]. Here, both L526M and M550V mutations were
detected in all HBV sequences derived from the two blood
samples collected during lamivudine treatment (1999
and 2002). Besides these common mutations, a third lamivudine resistant, rare mutation [11,31], namely V519L,

Lamivudine resistant mutations in the viral DNA polymerase and their counterparts in the small surface antigen are marked in bold. Asterisks
represent stop mutations.

was detected in one clone derived from the sample collected in 1999 as well as in all HBV sequences derived
from the sample collected in 2002. This was in agreement
with recent observations, showing that long lamivudine
treatment may result in the predominance of this rare
mutant [32]. The triple mutation V519L, L526M, M550V
causes the concomitant amino acid substitutions E164D
and I195M in the small S protein. It has been shown that
this triple mutant has a reduced in vitro affinity to antiHBs antibodies, similar to the hepatitis B vaccine escape
mutant G145R [11,31]. The accumulation of mutations in
the HBV genome should be monitored in order to guide
patient management adequately.
There is a general consensus that the lamivudine resistant
single mutants in the YMDD motif (M550V/I) replicate
substantially more slowly than the wild type. The addition
of the mutation at position 526 may act as a compensatory change that partially restores the replication fitness of
the virus [33]. Here, in agreement with this observation,
HBV DNA was detected at high levels (about 108 copies/
ml) in the blood sample collected in 1999, in which the
double mutant represents the major viral population.
Similar high HBV loads were observed in the sample containing the triple mutant (2002). This result is in agreement with a recent study, showing that V519L mutation
also enhances viral replication [34].

another substitution, namely G473E, was observed that
was associated to G119R substitution in the small S protein. Such a virus might be present as a minor population
but not detected during the first lamivudine treatment.
Although two out three clones of this population possessed stop codon mutations in S gene, HBV load (109
copies/ml) was moderately higher during the lamivudine
interruption period than that found during lamivudine
periods.
HBV chronically infected patients submitted to lamivudine treatment may have acute exacerbation after withdrawal of drug therapy or when lamivudine resistance
emerges [8,14-16,26,35-37]. In HIV-HBV co-infected
patients, withdrawal of lamivudine may result in severe
[8,35,37] or fulminant [37] hepatitis. Factors that trigger
severe hepatitis in these cases are not well known. Both
viral load and genome variations have been implicated in
the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation. Here, the patient
under study did not present clinical signs of HBV infection. The absence of acute exacerbation after the emergence of lamivudine resistant variants may be correlated
to the absence of significant variations of the viral load.
Indeed, HBV DNA was detected at high levels (108–109
copies/ml) at different periods of antiretroviral treatment
with and without lamivudine.

Conclusions
The HBV population that emerged during the interruption
of lamivudine treatment did not show mutations at
polymerase positions 519, 526 and 550. However,

A rare HBV triple mutant, belonging to genotype A, subgroup A', appeared predominantly in a patient submitted
to lamivudine as part of HIV treatment. This type of

mutant, previously found in isolates belonging to genotypes A, D and G [15,36], may behave as a vaccine escape
mutant. Understanding the circumstances leading to the
appearance of such HBV strains may help to guide future
therapies in HIV-HBV co-infected patients. A correlation
may exist between acute exacerbation of hepatitis B and
HBV load in lamivudine treated patients.
