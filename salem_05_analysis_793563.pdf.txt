Abstract
Background: Alu elements are short (~300 bp) interspersed elements that amplify in primate
genomes through a process termed retroposition. The expansion of these elements has had a
significant impact on the structure and function of primate genomes. Approximately 10 % of the
mass of the human genome is comprised of Alu elements, making them the most abundant short
interspersed element (SINE) in our genome. The majority of Alu amplification occurred early in
primate evolution, and the current rate of Alu retroposition is at least 100 fold slower than the
peak of amplification that occurred 30–50 million years ago. Alu elements are therefore a rich
source of inter- and intra-species primate genomic variation.
Results: A total of 153 Alu elements from the Ye subfamily were extracted from the draft
sequence of the human genome. Analysis of these elements resulted in the discovery of two new
Alu subfamilies, Ye4 and Ye6, complementing the previously described Ye5 subfamily. DNA
sequence analysis of each of the Alu Ye subfamilies yielded average age estimates of ~14, ~13 and
~9.5 million years old for the Alu Ye4, Ye5 and Ye6 subfamilies, respectively. In addition, 120 Alu
Ye4, Ye5 and Ye6 loci were screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to determine
their phylogenetic origin and levels of human genomic diversity.
Conclusion: The Alu Ye lineage appears to have started amplifying relatively early in primate
evolution and continued propagating at a low level as many of its members are found in a variety
of hominoid (humans, greater and lesser ape) genomes. Detailed sequence analysis of several Alu
pre-integration sites indicated that multiple types of events had occurred, including gene
conversions, near-parallel independent insertions of different Alu elements and Alu-mediated
genomic deletions. A potential hotspot for Alu insertion in the Fer1L3 gene on chromosome 10
was also identified.

Background
The proliferation of Alu elements has had a significant
impact on the architecture of primate genomes [1]. They

comprise over 10% of the human genome by mass and
are the most abundant short interspersed element (SINE)
in primate genomes [2]. Alu elements have achieved this

copy number by duplicating via an RNA intermediate in a
process termed retroposition [3]. During retroposition the
RNA copy is reverse transcribed by target primed reverse
transcription (TPRT) and subsequently integrated into the
genome [4-6]. While unable to retropose autonomously,
Alu elements are thought to borrow the factors that are
required for their amplification from the LINE (long interspersed element) elements [6-9], which encode a protein
with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity
[10,11]. Because of their high copy number, Alu repeats
have been a significant source of new mutations as a result
of insertion and post-integration recombination between
elements [12,13].
The majority of Alu amplification occurred early in primate evolution, and the current rate of Alu retroposition
is at least 100 fold slower than the peak of amplification
that appears to have occurred 30–50 million years ago
[2,14-16]. Even though there are over one million Alu elements within the human genome, only a small number of
these elements are capable of movement [17]. As a result
of the limited amplification capacity of Alu elements, a
series of discrete subfamilies of Alu elements that share
common diagnostic mutations have been identified in the
human genome [18-21]. A small subset of "young" Alu
repeats are so recent in origin that they are present in the
human genome and absent from the genomes of nonhuman primates, with some of the elements being polymorphic with respect to insertion presence/absence in
diverse human genomes [16,22-25]. Individual SINE elements have proven to be essentially homoplasy-free characters which are therefore quite useful for resolving
phylogenetic and population genetic questions [2,26-34].
For example, young Alu subfamilies which arose around

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/18

the radiation of Subtribe Hominina (gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans) four to six million years ago [35] were
used as homoplasy free phylogenetic markers to resolve
the branching order in hominids [36]. Relationships
among other primates have also been resolved using relatively large numbers of Alu elements as phylogenetic
markers [28,37-40]
We have previously characterized a large number of
recently integrated Alu elements found in the human
genome that fall in six distinct lineages, termed Ya, Yb and
Yc, Yd, Yg and Yi based upon their diagnostic mutations
[41-52]. Here, we describe the distribution in the human
genome of three Alu subfamilies that are members of the
Alu Ye lineage [53] and are characterized by four (Ye4),
five (Ye5) and six (Ye6) diagnostic mutations,
respectively.

Results
Subfamily size and age
Alu Ye elements were identified in the draft sequence of
the human genome using BLAST [54] queries of the draft
sequence to identify exact complements to an Alu Ye specific oligonucleotide (Fig. 1). See the Materials and Methods section for details on the search. Using this approach
we identified 25 Ye4 subfamily members that shared four
diagnostic base positions and thus comprised the Alu Ye4
subfamily. We also identified 103 elements that shared
five diagnostic base positions and comprise the Alu Ye5
subfamily and 25 Ye6 subfamily members that shared six
diagnostic base positions and comprised the Alu Ye6 subfamily. Each of the subfamilies was named in accordance
with standard nomenclature for new Alu subfamilies [55].

To estimate the copy number of the Ye4, Ye5 and Ye6 Alu
subfamilies, we preformed BLAST searches of the draft
sequence of the human genome using an Alu Ye lineagespecific oligonucleotide to query the database (as outlined in the methods). Seventeen of the 25 Alu Ye4 elements were unique (non-paralogous). There were also 76
unique Ye5 Alu elements and 23 unique Ye6 Alu subfamily members. Multiple alignments of the Alu elements
from each subfamily were constructed and the number of
mutations from the consensus sequence for each Alu subfamily was determined. In each case the mutations were
divided into those that occur at CpG dinucleotides and
those that occur at non-CpG positions without including
small insertions or deletions as described previously [4749]. The mutations are divided into these two different
classes to estimate the average age of each subfamily
because the CpG base positions in repeated sequences
mutate at a rate that is about six times higher than nonCpG positions [56] as a result of the spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine residues [57].
Mutation densities were calculated for each Alu Ye subfamily. For 17 elements from the Alu Ye4 subfamily, the
non-CpG and CpG mutation densities were 2.1% (83/
3944) and 12.5 % (106/850). Using a neutral rate of evolution of 0.15% per million years for non-CpG positions
[58] and 0.9% per million years for the CpG base positions [56] along with the average mutation density yields
age estimates of 14.03 and 13.86 million years old for the
Ye4 subfamily. For the Alu Ye5 subfamily 76 elements
were analyzed that contained a total of 17632 non-CpG
nucleotides and 3800 CpG nucleotides that contained
351 non-CpG and 431 CpG mutations. The mutation
densities of the Ye5 subfamily were 1.99% and 11.34%
for the non-CpG and CpG nucleotides yielding age estimates based on the average mutation density of 13.27 and
12.60 million years old. For the Alu Ye6 subfamily 23 elements were analyzed that contained a total of 5336 nonCpG nucleotides and 1150 CpG nucleotides that contained 86 non-CpG and 92 CpG mutations. The mutation
densities of the Ye6 subfamily were 1.61% and 8% for the
non-CpG and CpG nucleotides yielding age estimates
based on the average mutation density of 10.75 and 8.89
million years old.
Evolutionary analysis
In order to determine the approximate time of insertion
for each Alu Ye4, Ye5 and Ye6 subfamily member, we performed a series of PCR reactions using human and nonhuman primate DNA samples as templates. Unfortunately, not all of the loci identified in the draft sequence
were amenable to PCR analysis, as some of them had
inserted into other repetitive regions of the genome making the design of flanking unique sequence PCR primers
difficult.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/18

For the Ye subfamilies, 120 of the 153 elements identified
in the draft human genomic sequence were amplified by
PCR. Examination of the orthologous regions of the various species genomes displayed a series of different PCR
patterns indicative of the time of retroposition of each of
the elements into the primate genomes. Results from a
series of these experiments showed a gradient of Ye Alu
repeats beginning with some elements that are recent in
origin and unique to the human genome (e.g. Ye5AH110)
and ending with elements that are found within all ape
genomes (e.g. Ye5AH148). The distribution of all the Ye
elements in various primate genomes is summarized in
Additional File 2.
Gene conversion
Gene conversion between Alu elements and in other
regions of the human genome exerts a significant influence on the accumulation of single nucleotide diversity
within the human genome [2,50]. To estimate the frequency of gene conversion in the Alu Ye subfamily members, we compared the sequences of the elements found in
the human genome to the consensus sequences of other
Alu subfamilies. Using this approach, we identified two
Alu Ye5 subfamily members that appeared to have been
subjected to partial gene conversion at their 3' ends. Alu
Ye5AH70 contains three mutations that are diagnostic for
the Yb8/9 subfamily. Similarly, Alu Ye5AH173 contains
three Alu Sc mutations. Each of the sequence exchanges
occurred in a short contiguous sequence suggesting that
they were products of gene conversion rather than homoplasic point mutations.

We identified one Alu-containing locus that was involved
in full gene conversion/ replacement event, (Ye5AH181).
In this case, the orthologous Alu elements have similar
flanking sequences and direct repeats, although they are
not precisely identical due to the random mutations that
accumulated over time. DNA sequence analysis of this
locus showed that the Alu element of selected new world
monkey genomes (spider monkey, woolly monkey and
tamarin) belonged to the Alu Sg subfamily. This suggests
that a gene conversion of an older, pre-existing Alu Sg may
have introduced the Ye5 sequence in the common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.
Amplification of this locus was unsuccessful in the old
world monkey taxa tested.
Alu-mediated genomic deletions
Two deletions of part of the human genome appeared to
be associated with newly inserted Alu Ye elements. These
deletions were identified at loci Ye5AH24 and Ye5AH27.
In the case of Ye5AH24, the deletion was associated with
a gene conversion of an Alu Y in both orangutan and siamang to AluYe5 in human, bonobo, common chimpanzee and gorilla and involved the removal of about 500 bp

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:18

from the 3' flanking region. For Alu Ye5AH27, the deletion was associated with a gene conversion of an Alu Sx
element (orangutan and siamang) to AluYe5 (human,
bonobo, common chimpanzee and gorilla) and involved
the removal of 142 bp from the 3' flanking region. Based
on this data, we estimate the frequency of Alu retroposition mediated deletions of approximately 1.67% (2/120).
The pre-integration sites for three elements (Ye5AH11,
Ye5AH40 and Ye5AH173) did not amplify in any nonhuman primate species. Previously, the insertion of L1
elements has been shown to be associated with large
genomic deletions [59]. Thus, one possible explanation
for the absence of pre-integration PCR products would be
that a large deletion (>1 kb) occurred at each of these loci
during Alu integration. If a deletion occurred during the
integration of an Alu element in the human genome, then
the pre-integration product size calculated computationally would be an underestimate of the true size of the
locus. To investigate this possibility, we utilized long template PCR reactions of these loci that would facilitate the
amplification of larger (up to 25 kb) products. Unfortunately, PCR amplicons were not generated by any of these
loci, suggesting that the retrotransposition of these Alu
elements in humans may have generated deletions greater
than 25 kb in size. Alternately, the orthologous loci in
non-human primate genomes may have undergone additional mutations at the oligonucleotide primer sites, preventing PCR amplification.
Independent Alu insertions
We have also identified one locus (Ye5AH161) that contained multiple paralogous Alu insertions in human,
chimpanzee, gorilla lineage, old world monkey and new
world monkey lineages (Fig. 2). In the human, chimpanzee and gorilla lineage (subtribe Hominina) there was an
independent insertion of an Alu Ye5 in the 5' flank of an
Alu Sx that is common to all taxa. In all the old world
monkey genomes tested (Green monkey, Macaque and
Rhesus monkey), an Alu Sp has inserted in the 5' flank of
the shared Sx element about 58 bp away of the Alu Ye5
present in Hominina. Also, in the woolly and spider monkeys (new world monkeys), there was an independent
insertion of an Alu Sx in the 5' flank of the shared Alu Sx.
In gibbon, siamang and orangutan, there were no independent Alu insertions at this locus, only the common Alu
Sx is present. In orangutan, however, there was an extra
145 bp of genomic sequences inserted inside the old Alu
Sx. The pattern discussed suggests that these three independent parallel insertion events occurred sometime after
the divergence of these primates from one another. This
locus on chromosome 10q23.33 lies in intron 39–40 of
the Human Fer1L3 gene, about 50 bp from exon 39. This
locus may be considered a hot spot for Alu insertion. An
alignment of locus Ye5AH161 is available as Additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/18

file 1 and at http://batzerlab.lsu.edu/Additional_File_1__Ye5AH161_alignment.fas.
We also identified another near-parallel independent Alu
insertion event at human Ye5AH16 locus in all the old
world monkey genomes tested (Green monkey, Macaque
and Rhesus), within the same locus where an Alu Ye5 element was located in the human, chimpanzee, gorilla and
orangutan genomes. Thus, the near-parallel insertion
most likely occurred after the divergence of humans and
apes from old world monkeys, but before the radiation of
the old world monkeys. The element present in the old
world monkey genomes is an Alu Y and is 80 bp from the
human insertion site.
Human genomic diversity
To determine the human genomic diversity associated
with each of the Alu Ye4, Ye5 and Ye6 subfamily members, we performed a series of PCR reactions on a collection of 80 geographically-diverse human genomes. Using
this approach, we identified one new Alu insertion polymorphism (Ye5AH167) from the loci analyzed in this
report. The allele frequencies, genotypes and heterozygosities for the Alu insertion polymorphism are shown in
Table 1.

Discussion
Our detailed analysis of the Alu Ye5 subfamily resulted in
the recovery of two new Alu subfamilies, Ye4 and Ye6.
Each of these Alu subfamilies has a relatively small copy
number in the human genome. The proportion of polymorphic elements within each of the subfamilies is quite
low with only 0.83% of the Alu Ye elements being polymorphic, only one member of Ye subfamilies
(Ye5AD167) is polymorphic with respect to insertion
presence/absence in the human genome. In contrast,
many other young Alu subfamilies have levels of insertion
polymorphism in excess of 20% [2]. Therefore, the amplification of these Alu subfamilies within the human
genome has occurred at a very low rate, and may have
recently ceased entirely. The estimated average ages of
~14, ~13 and ~9.5 million years old for the Alu Ye4, Ye5
and Ye6 subfamilies, respectively are consistent with their
relatively recent origin in primate genomes. It is also consistent with the master gene model of SINE retroposition
which suggests that as a master element accumulates
mutations over time, the resulting elements will share
those mutations [60].
Members of the Alu Ye lineages are dispersed throughout
the genomes of all hominoids (humans, greater and lesser
apes) suggesting that this subfamily of Alu elements began
to amplify about 15–20 million years ago. Therefore, the
Ye subfamily appears to have been retroposition competent during hominoid evolution, but must have been

genomes. Smaller bands were found in orangutan, gibbon and siamang. Sequence analysis of the PCR products shows three
independent insertions; a Ye5 in subtribe Hominina (human, chimpanzee and gorilla), a second insertion of an Alu Sp in old
world monkeys, and an Alu Sx insertion in new world monkeys. Suspected non-homologous recombination has inserted 145 bp

relatively inefficient at producing copies. Although the
rate of Ye amplification has not been dramatic within the
human lineage, it may be quite interesting to recover Alu
Ye subfamily members from other ape genomes and to

determine the rate of Ye subfamily amplification in these
genomes to see if there has been any differential amplification of these elements in non-human primate genomes.

members of the rodent lineage has been reported previously suggesting that the amplification of SINEs within
various genomes is subject to changes [61,62].
Gene conversion between Alu repeats has been reported
previously [26,63,64]. The gene conversion events involve
in three Alu Ye subfamily members were quite interesting.
In one case (Ye5AH181), the Alu-containing locus was
involved in full gene conversion event where Alu Sg in
new world monkeys is replaced by an Alu Ye5 in Humans,
chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutan. In the other two
cases (Ye5AH70 and Ye5AH173), only a small portion of
the 3' end of the Ye elements were involved in the gene
conversion. This is in good agreement with the molecular
nature of gene conversion events recently reported for the
Ya5 and Yb8/9 Alu subfamilies [47,48,64,65]. The detection of three gene conversion events from about 153 Alu
Ye elements suggests that gene conversion of these events
has been relatively rare, with a rate of 1.96%. However,
this rate is comparable to that reported previously for the
Alu Ya5 and Yb8 subfamilies within the human genome,
as well as that for the Ta subfamily of human LINE elements [64-66].
In all cases, the Ye Alu family members that were involved
in the gene conversion were monomorphic for insertion
presence within the human genome. In the partial gene
conversion events, the Ye Alu repeats were gene converted
by Yb8/9 and Sx Alu elements. The Yb8/9 Alu subfamily
was one of the first groups of Alu repeats that was ever
reported to be involved in gene conversion, and may be
more prone to these types of events as a result of a retroposition rate that is slightly higher than other recently integrated Alu subfamilies in the human genome [48,64,65].
The gene conversion between Alu elements may in part be
a function of the length of time that the individual Alu elements have resided in the human genome [26,50]. Based
on an examination of low copy number transgenes in the
mouse, it has been suggested that the germline recombination machinery in mammals has been evolved to pre-

vent high levels of ectopic recombination between
repetitive sequences [67]. It is quite possible that the high
copy number of Alu elements allows for pairing between
regions of sequence identity of different Alu elements initiating the start of gene conversion before cellular control
systems can terminate the process resulting in the production of small gene conversion tracts.
The identification of multiple paralogous Alu insertions
involving an Alu Ye element (Ye5AH161) in humans,
bonobo, common chimpanzee and gorilla lineage, Alu Sp
in old world monkeys lineage and Alu Sx in new world
monkeys lineage is also interesting. The paralogous insertion of an Alu repeat into the orthologous regions of
human and non-human primate genomes is an independent evolutionary event [26]. To date there are no
known cases of the independent insertion of paralogous
Alu elements into identical sites within different genomes.
The detection of parallel insertions is a function of the rate
of retroposition of Alu elements within various primate
lineages and the time since the most recent common
ancestor [26]. However, this locus (Ye5AH161) supports
the idea of hotspots for the integration of Alu repeats
within primate genomes. Future studies on the integration
of different SINE elements in syntenic regions of human
and rodent genomes may yield new insight into the
molecular nature of hotspots for SINE element
integration.
Genomic deletions created upon LINE-1 retrotransposition using cell culture assays have been recently identified
[59]. The rate of LINE element deletion was estimated
indirectly in the human genome to be about 3% [68] or
8–13% through sequencing variable sizes of the preintegration sites of L1HS in primates [69]. The precise molecular mechanism of the LINE mediated genomic deletions
is still unclear. Recently, an Alu-mediated deletion that
resulted in the inactivation of the human CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase gene [70] and Alu mediated
deletions of noncoding genomic sequences have been
Page 6 of 9

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:18

identified [71]. Here we report two new examples of Alu
retroposition-mediated deletions that may have
happened by a mechanism similar to that of the LINE element mediated genomic deletions since Alu and L1 elements utilize a common mobilization pathway [6,8,72].
In both cases, Alu Ye5AH24 and Alu Ye5AH27, the deletion appears to have occurred, after the separation of
human, chimpanzee and gorillas from orangutan and Siamang, during the process of gene conversion similar to the
lineage specific Alu deletion reported previously [70,71].
Here, we have estimated the frequency of Alu retroposition associated genomic deletions as approximately
1.67%. The size of the deleted sequences was over 300 bp
on average. New Alu integrations have been estimated to
occur in vivo at a frequency of one new event in every 10
to 200 births [12]. If sizable deletions accompany one in
every 100 new Alu retroposition events in vivo, the
genomic impact of these events could be substantial. This
is not a trivial number of deletions when extrapolated to
the copy number of Alu elements in the human genome
which is over one million [2]. Approximately about
16,700 Alu elements may have been involved in retroposition mediated deletion events within primate genomes.
If each of these deletion events removes an average of 300
bp of genomic sequence, this would mean that Alu retroposition mediates the deletion of about 5 Mb of the primate genomic sequences. However, if the Alu associated
deletions have involved larger sequences similar to those
recently reported for LINE elements [59], then the impact
of these events may be 50–500 Mb of lineage specific deletions. In either case, these types of events represent a novel
mechanism of lineage-specific deletion within the primate order. Detailed studies of the orthologous regions of
primate genomes deleted in this manner may prove
instructive for understanding the genetic basis of the difference between humans and non-human primates.

Conlcusion
The Alu Ye lineage has had an extended history of expansion in the human lineage. Its expansion appears to have
begun soon after the divergence of the hominoids from
the remainder of the catarrhine primates and proceeded at
a relatively low level since then. Extended periods of relatively low levels of retrotransposition may allow some
mobile elements to retain duplication capability for long
periods of time. Despite a relatively low level of retrotransposition, the Alu Ye lineage has contributed to the
architecture of the human genome through insertion
mutations, retrotransposition associated genomic deletions, and gene conversion.

Methods
Computational analysis
To identify Alu Ye elements in the draft sequence of the
human genome (August 6, 2001, UCSC GoldenPath
assembly), we used Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) [54] queries of the draft sequence to identify
exact complements to the oligonucleotide 5'- GAACCCCGGGGGGCGGAGCCTGCAG-3' that is diagnostic for
the Ye lineage as shown in Fig. 1. All of the exact complements to the oligonucleotide queries along with 1000 bp
of adjacent flanking unique DNA sequence were excised
and stored as unique files and subjected to additional
analysis as outlined previously [47-49]. A complete list of
all the Alu elements identified in the searches is located in
Additional file 2 and is available at http://batzer
lab.lsu.edu/Additional_File_2__Supplemental_Table.doc.
DNA samples and PCR amplification
Oligonucleotide primers and PCR amplification reactions
for each of the Alu Ye lineage loci analyzed were performed as previously described [47-49] using the primers
and annealing temperatures shown in Additional file 2 for
Alu Ye lineage members. Diverse human DNA samples
were available from previous studies [47-49]. The cell
lines used to isolate DNA samples were as follows: chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), WES (ATCC CRL1609); gorilla
(Gorilla gorilla) lowland gorilla Coriell AG05251B, Ggo-1
(primary gorilla fibroblasts) provided by Dr. Stephen J.
O'Brien, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA;
bonobo (Pan paniscus) Coriell AG05253A; orangutan
(Pongo pygmaeus) ATCC CRL6301; green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) ATCC CCL70 (old world monkey); and
owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus) OMK (OMKidney) ATCC
CRL 1556 (new world monkey). Cell lines were maintained as directed by the source and DNA isolations were
performed using Wizard genomic DNA purification
(Promega). DNA samples from peripheral lymphocytes or
tissue were prepared from the gibbon (Hylobates lar) and
siamang (Hylobates syndactylus). Additional non-human
primate DNA samples (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus,
Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Macaca mulatta (old world
monkey), Macaca nemestrina (old world monkey), Saquinus labiatus (new world monkey), Lagothrix lagotricha
(new world monkey), Ateles geoffroyi (new world monkey)
and Lemur catta (prosimian) available as a primate phylogenetic panel (PRP00001) were purchased from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research.
Sequence analysis
DNA sequencing was performed on a gel purified PCR
products that had been cloned using the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) using chain termination sequencing [73] on an Applied Biosystems 3100 automated DNA
sequencer. The sequence of the orthologous loci (that

alignments of the Ye lineage subfamily members were
performed using MegAlign software (DNAStar version
3.1.7 for Windows 3.2). The ages for each of the Alu Ye
subfamilies were calculated using mutation densities as
previously described [43,47-49,65] with rates suggested
by Xing et al. [56].
