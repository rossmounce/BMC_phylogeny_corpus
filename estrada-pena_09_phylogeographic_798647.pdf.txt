Abstract
Background: The tick-borne pathogen Anaplasma marginale, which is endemic worldwide, is the type species of the
genus Anaplasma (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae). Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is the most important tick vector of
A. marginale in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Despite extensive characterization of the genetic diversity
in A. marginale geographic strains using major surface protein sequences, little is known about the biogeography and
evolution of A. marginale and other Anaplasma species. For A. marginale, MSP1a was shown to be involved in vectorpathogen and host-pathogen interactions and to have evolved under positive selection pressure. The MSP1a of A.
marginale strains differs in molecular weight because of a variable number of tandem 23-31 amino acid repeats and has
proven to be a stable marker of strain identity. While phylogenetic studies of MSP1a repeat sequences have shown
evidence of A. marginale-tick co-evolution, these studies have not provided phylogeographic information on a global scale
because of the high level of MSP1a genetic diversity among geographic strains.
Results: In this study we showed that the phylogeography of A. marginale MSP1a sequences is associated with world
ecological regions (ecoregions) resulting in different evolutionary pressures and thence MSP1a sequences. The results
demonstrated that the MSP1a first (R1) and last (RL) repeats and microsatellite sequences were associated with world
ecoregion clusters with specific and different environmental envelopes. The evolution of R1 repeat sequences was found
to be under positive selection. It is hypothesized that the driving environmental factors regulating tick populations could
act on the selection of different A. marginale MSP1a sequence lineages, associated to each ecoregion.
Conclusion: The results reported herein provided the first evidence that the evolution of A. marginale was linked to
ecological traits affecting tick vector performance. These results suggested that some A. marginale strains have evolved
under conditions that support pathogen biological transmission by R. microplus, under different ecological traits which
affect performance of R. microplus populations. The evolution of other A. marginale strains may be linked to transmission
by other tick species or to mechanical transmission in regions where R. microplus is currently eradicated. The information
derived from this study is fundamental toward understanding the evolution of other vector-borne pathogens.

Background
The genus Anaplasma (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae)
contains obligate intracellular organisms found exclusively within membrane-bound inclusions or parasitophorous vacuoles in the cytoplasm of both vertebrate and
invertebrate host cells [1,2]. The genus Anaplasma includes
pathogens of ruminants, A. marginale, A. centrale, A. bovis,
and A. ovis. Also included in this genus are A. phagocytophilum, which infects a wide range of hosts including
humans and wild and domesticated animals, and A. platys
that infects dogs.
To date, most research has been reported for A. marginale,
the type species for the genus Anaplasma [3]. Both cattle
and ticks develop persistent infections with A. marginale
and therefore can serve as reservoirs of infection. A. marginale is transmitted horizontally by ixodid ticks including
Rhipicephalus spp. and Demacentor spp. Rhipicephalus
(Boophilus) microplus is considered the most important
biological vector in tropical and subtropical regions of the
world [4]. Transfer of infected blood by biting flies or
blood-contaminated fomites effects mechanical transmission of A. marginale. The complex developmental cycle of
A. marginale has been described and shown to be coordinated with the tick feeding cycle [3]. The midgut is the first
site of infection, where membrane-bound vacuoles or colonies initially contain reticulated forms that divide by
binary fission and subsequently transform into dense
forms. Infection of salivary glands and other tissues then
occurs which completes the developmental cycle and
allows for transmission to susceptible hosts during tick
feeding.
Vector-pathogen interactions involve traits from both the
vector and the pathogen [5]. Several major surface proteins (MSPs) have been identified and characterized in A.
marginale [3,5]. MSPs are involved in interactions with
both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts [2,3,6-9], and
therefore are likely to evolve more rapidly than other
genes because they are subjected to selective pressures
exerted by host immune systems. The MSP1a of A. marginale geographic strains differs in molecular weight due to a
variable number of tandem 23-31 amino acid repeats, and
the sequence of MSP1a has been shown to be a stable
marker for identification of geographic strains [10,11].
Functionally, MSP1a was shown to be an adhesin for
bovine erythrocytes and tick cells [12-14]. Tick molecules
involved in vector-A. marginale interactions were recently
identified and functionally characterized [15].
The geographic strains of A. marginale are highly variable,
as demonstrated by the analysis of MSP1a sequences
[7,11]. Such genetic heterogeneity observed among A.
marginale strains in endemic regions could be explained
by cattle movement and maintenance of different geno-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/57

types by independent transmission events, due to infection exclusion of A. marginale in cattle and ticks which
commonly results in the establishment of only one genotype per animal [16-18]. Due to the high degree of
sequence variation within most endemic areas, MSP1a
sequences have failed to provide phylogeographic information on a global scale [7]. These studies also suggested
that multiple introductions of A. marginale strains from
different geographic locations had occurred in many
regions.
The evolutionary history of vector-pathogen interactions
can be reflected in the sequence variation of Anaplasma
MSPs. Previous studies demonstrated that A. marginale
MSP1a evolved under positive selection [19]. Analysis of
A. marginale MSP1a repeats provided evidence of tickpathogen co-evolution [5,6,20], a result that is consistent
with the biological function of MSP1a in pathogen transmission by ticks [14]. However, the study of A. marginale
evolutionary history and tick-pathogen co-evolution has
remained elusive because of the extensive genetic diversity
of MSP1a sequences.
In this study we analyzed MSP1a repeat and microsatellite
sequences in order to provide information on the evolution of A. marginale strains by determining their phylogeographic association with world ecological regions
(ecoregions) and by testing the effect of different evolutionary pressures associated with the tick vector, mainly R.
microplus, ecology in these ecoregions.

Methods
Anaplasma marginale MSP1a repeat sequences
The MSP1a sequences included in this study were
obtained from A. marginale strains collected worldwide
from infected cattle and recently reviewed by de la Fuente
et al. [11]. The data on MSP1a sequences was updated by
searching the Genbank sequence database [21]. The
amino acid sequence of the first (R1) and last (RL) MSP1a
repeats of 111 A. marginale strains were used in this study,
from which 39 and 28 unique R1 and RL sequences,
respectively, were obtained. For comparison, the
sequences of Rn MSP1a repeats, located between R1 and
RL, were included in some analyses. MSP1a sequences not
included in these studies were from A. marginale strains
that were not adequately geo-referenced.
Anaplasma marginale MSP1a microsatellite sequences
A microsatellite was located in the MSP1a 5'UTR between
the putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GTAGG; [6]) and
the translation initiation codon (ATG). The structure of
the microsatellite (bold) was GTAGG (G/A TTT)m (GT)n
T ATG (Table 1). The microsatellite was sequenced in 115
A. marginale strains collected from infected cattle in the

The MSP1a microsatellite sequences were analyzed in 115 A. marginale strains. The microsatellite (sequence in bold) was located between the
Shine-Dalgarno (SD; sequence in brackets) and the translation initiation codon (ATG) with the structure: GTAGG (G/A TTT)m (GT)n T ATG.
The SD-ATG distance was calculated in nucleotides as (4 × m) + (2 × n) + 1. Abbreviation: NI, not included in the study because the A. marginale

World ecoregions and association with A. marginale
strains
Ecoregions are used herein to classify the world across
dynamic environmental factors. We assumed that i) ecoregions could be delineated using quantitative abiotic characters based on well-recognized and repeatable attributes
and ii) A. marginale strains are associated with each ecoregion and subjected to different environmental conditions
that could be analyzed by multivariate geographic clustering [22]. Multivariate geographic clustering involves the
use of standardized values for selected environmental
conditions in a set of raster maps. Those values serve as
coordinates in the environmental data space, in which
environmental conditions are further clustered according
to their similarities. The feature selected to put together
the clusters was the monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI is a variable that reflects vegetation stress, a feature that summarizes information
about the ecological background for tick populations
[23]. We obtained a 0.1° resolution series of monthly
NDVI data for the period 1986-2006. The 12 averaged
monthly images were subjected to Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) to obtain decomposition into the main
axes representing the most significant, non-redundant
information. The strongest principal axes were chosen
using Cattell's Scree Test [22]. It has been found that the

first principal component derived from NDVI typically
represents the greenness of the surveyed area [24]. Component 2 is interpreted as a change component, taken to
represent a winter/summer seasonality effect. Components 3 and 4 are also essentially seasonal, but represent
areas where the timing of green-up is different from that
in component 2. Our PCA analysis retained three principal axes, explaining the 92% of total variance. These three
axes were related to the mean NDVI values, annual amplitude, and NDVI values in the period May to August,
respectively. We then used a hierarchical agglomerative
clustering on PCA values to classify multiple geographical
areas into a single common set of discrete regions. Mahalanobis distance was used as a measure of dissimilarity
and the weighted pair-group average was used as the
amalgamation method. A value of 0.05 was used as the
cut-off probability for assignment to a given ecoregion. All
the procedures adhered to methods previously described
[25].
The decision about the number of ecoregions to retain
without any prior detail about the information they contain is a problem to which a solution has not yet been
found. The main goal is to define unambiguously the A.
marginale strains recorded mostly in a single ecoregion
cluster and present in the highest number of geographical
sites belonging to that cluster. The result is to refine the
degree of clustering that gives the optimal degree of association between A. marginale strains ('species') and ecore-

gions ('sites'). This analysis was done using the 'indicator
species' method [26], a previously published multivariate
statistics procedure to define 'sites' as a function of their
faunal composition ('species'). We began the agglomerative process described above with an unrealistic high
number of ecoregions. At every step of the agglomerative
process, pathogen strains and ecoregions were ordered by
a correspondence analysis, and then analyzed using the
'indicator species' method. The procedure runs iteratively,
trying to improve the association with further clustering
of ecoregions. However, the method does not force a cluster if specifications of cut-off probabilities for ecoregions
are violated, and does not assume any a priori condition
about the geographical range of any cluster. The proce-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/57

dure is only an indicator that stops when an optimum
degree of ecoregion clustering collectively explaining the
association of A. marginale strains with the environment is
reached. Such association may be low or high (in the
range 0-1) but is the optimal according to the ecoregion
features. After the use of these methods we retained a total
of four ecoregion clusters (Figure 1) to which A. marginale
sequences were unambiguously associated, and the rest
were discarded because A. marginale strains were not isolated there.

gion cluster were used to determine the consensus
sequence in the cluster. The distances between groups of
sequences ascribed to an ecoregion cluster were then computed, both within and between clusters. The hypothesis
herein is that highest affinities between R1 and RL isolates
are observed when grouped according to the ecoregion to
which they are related. An alternative hypothesis is that
isolates cluster according to a geographical background.
To check for that alternative hypothesis we examined
genetic distances with strains arranged into geographical
groups. We used only American strains to overcome the
undersampling in Africa. They were grouped as Western
USA, Eastern USA, Mesoamerica and the Caribbean, and
South America, and then distances within and between
geographical clusters computed again.
Other analyses involved calculation of the percentage of
changes between the consensus MSP1a repeat sequences
among different ecoregion clusters as a measure of the
genetic distance between A. marginale strains in these clusters. Some R1 and RL sequences were found associated
with more than one ecoregion cluster. Therefore, the percentage of changes in amino acid composition for every
sequence and the consensus sequence in each cluster were
computed as a measure of similarity of each sequence and
consensus sequence for each cluster. MSP1a repeat
sequences were aligned for pairwise comparison and
determination of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions using Mega 4 [27]. The dN and dS
were determined among all pairwise comparisons of
MSP1a repeat sequences within each ecoregion cluster,
estimated by the method of Nei and Gojobori [28] with
the correction for multiple substitutions [29]. The ratio of
the mean dN/dS was used as an indicator of the level of
selection acting on MSP1a repeat sequences.
As an additional test to verify our hypothesis, we performed a Mantel's test. The explanation of the distribution
of the strains in terms of environmental variables may be
confounded because the variables are intercorrelated
among themselves, and so it may be difficult to ascribe
causal mechanisms to the environmental variables. Mantel's test is a regression in which the variables are dissimilarity matrices. The operative question is 'do strains that
have similar sequences also tend to be similar in terms of
the environmental variables?' Therefore we performed a
Mantel's test both between a dependent distance matrix
(genetic similarities of R1 and RL) and the predictor
matrix of geographical distances among strains. A second
Mantel's test was done with the same dependent matrix
and a predictor dissimilarity matrix based on environmental PCA-derived values. Such correlations will indicate if locations that are closer or locations that are similar
environmentally are similar compositionally. Mantel's

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/57

tests were performed using the Jackard index according to
[30].
Analysis of A. marginale MSP1a microsatellite sequences
The extent of genetic differentiation of A. marginale strains
at the MSP1a microsatellite was assessed within and
among ecoregion clusters using an analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA; [31]) and pairwise population FST significance tests as implemented in ARLEQUIN, version
3.01 [32]. The statistical significance of fixation indices
was tested using a non-parametric permutation approach
[33] with 20,000 permutations. Ecoregion clusters for
which statistically significant subdivision was not
detected were pooled to define groups.

The effect of microsatellite size on MSP1a expression was
characterized in A. marginale strains Wetumka (OK; Genbank accession number AY010247), Okeechobee (FL;
AY010244), Idaho (ID; M32868) and HB-A8 (China;
DQ811774) sequences. These strains had microsatellite
genotypes G (Wetumka and Okeechobee; distance SDATG = 23 nucleotides), C (Idaho; SD-ATG = 19 nucleotides) and I (China; SD-ATG = 29 nucleotides). The
msp1alpha gene containing promoter sequences active in
Escherichia coli [6] was amplified using oligonucleotide
primers MSP1aP: 5'GCATTACAACGCAACGCTTGAG3'
and MSP1a3: 5'GCTTTACGCCGCCGCCTGCGCC3' and
cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
as reported previously [20]. Three independent clones for
each of the MSP1a constructs were transformed in E. coli
JM109 cells and grown for 15 to 20 hours at 37°C. Culture volumes of 3 ml were used for RNA and DNA extraction using TriReagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)
according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) prior to RT-PCR. MSP1a mRNA levels
were characterized by real-time RT-PCR using oligonucleotide
primers
MSP1RT5:
5'ACCAATCGTTGGCAGAAGAG3'
and
MSP1RT3:
5'ACCTGCTCCCAAAGTAGCAA3'
and
normalizing
against E. coli D-1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase
gene (dxs) [34] and plasmid DNA copy number by
msp1alpha PCR using the oligonucleotide primers and
conditions described above. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted using the iScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit with SYBR
Green and an iQ5 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). Control reactions were performed using the same
procedures but without reverse transcriptase to test for
DNA contamination in the RNA preparations and without RNA added to detect contamination of the PCR reaction. The normalized mRNA levels were compared
between different MSP1a constructs using an ANOVA test
(P = 0.05).

Results
Anaplasma marginale MSP1a repeat sequences show
ecoregion-specific signatures
Ecoregion clusters showed different NDVI, temperature
and rainfall values (Figure 1). Ecoregion cluster 1
extended over large areas of central Africa and central
South America, primarily Argentina and southern Brazil.
It involved a region with medium to high NDVI values
with a clear seasonal decrease between June and September. This was the ecoregion with the highest recorded temperature and around 1,000 mm of annual rainfall.
Ecoregion cluster 2 included vast areas of the Mesoamerican corridor, northern South America and a small territory
of eastern South Africa. It consisted of zones with high
NDVI along the year without seasonal variability, temperature values similar to those in ecoregion cluster 1 and
rainfall around 1,500 mm/year. Ecoregion cluster 3
extended over central South Africa and scattered parts of
southern USA and Mexico, with the lowest NDVI values
and little change across the year. This ecoregion displayed
lower temperature values and the minimum rainfall.
Finally, ecoregion cluster 4 extended over large areas of
USA and had a clear NDVI signature, very low between
November and March and then rising to reach maximum
levels around July. This area was the coldest among all the
ecoregion clusters and rainfall was around 800 mm/year.

Figures 2 and 3 display the association of the A. marginale
strains with the four ecoregion clusters. These figures are
plotted according to the values of the first two axes
derived from PCA on NDVI time series. Figures plot the
80% confidence ellipses of the annual mean NDVI and

the seasonal variation of NDVI for each ecoregion cluster,
as well as the plot of the isolates in the NDVI envelope.
Analysis showed that 77% of MSP1a R1 unique sequences
were associated with only one ecoregion cluster (Figure
2). Ten R1 unique sequences (25.6% of the total number
of R1 sequences) were reported exclusively in ecoregion
cluster 1 and they shared 16 out of 31 amino acids (51.6%
of the total number of amino acids; Table 2). Six R1
unique sequences (12.8%) were reported solely in ecoregion cluster 2 with 64.5% identical amino acids. Twelve
R1 unique sequences (30.7%) were found only in ecoregion cluster 3, sharing 64.5% of their amino acids. Only
three R1 sequences were exclusively associated with ecoregion cluster 4, with 77.4% identical amino acids. All of
the A. marginale MSP1a R1 sequences within each ecoregion cluster appeared to be under positive selection as
shown by dN/dS indexes of 1.83, 1.61, 1.54 and 1.21 for
ecoregion clusters 1 to 4, respectively.
Differences were found among the R1 sequences at each
ecoregion cluster. Comparison of consensus sequences
between clusters 1 and 2 revealed 22.5% of amino acid
differences. Ecoregion clusters 1 and 3 differed by 25% of
their consensus sequences while ecoregion clusters 2 and
3 had only 19% of different amino acids in their R1
sequences. Five R1 sequences, T, 13, 23, D and L were
found simultaneously in two of the ecoregion clusters
(Figure 2, Table 2). Details of their similitude with the
consensus sequences of each ecoregion cluster are
included in Table 2. Three R1 sequences, A, B and alpha
appeared associated with different ecoregions. Pairwise
comparisons between A. marginale R1 sequences demon-

strated that genetic distances were lower within than
between ecoregion clusters (Table 3). However, when
strains were compared as clustered geographically, intracluster distances were much higher, revealing a clear heterogeneity between geographic strains and rejecting the
hypothesis of a pure geographical association. Mantel's
test on R1 sequences was 0.82 (P < 0.001) when applied
to ecoregion clusters using only unique sequences. Mantel's test on R1 sequences dropped to 0.72 (P < 0.005)
when every sequence in the ecoregion clusters was
included. The same test provided a value of 0.31 (P =
0.145) for the distances matrix based on geographical
association of strains.

Discriminant analysis showed that 74.8% of MSP1a RL
sequences were found associated with one ecoregion cluster only (Figure 3, Table 2). Seven RL sequences (25% of
the total number of RL sequences) were reported exclusively in ecoregion cluster 1, with 61.2% identical amino
acids. Five RL sequences (17.8%) were reported solely in
ecoregion cluster 2 with 64.5% identical amino acids.
Twelve RL sequences (32%) were found only in ecoregion
cluster 3, sharing 61.2% of their amino acids. No RL
unique sequences were found in ecoregion cluster 4. The
differences in RL consensus sequences between ecoregion

repeat sequences, the RL sequences within each ecoregion
cluster did not appear to be under positive selection as
shown by dN/dS indexes of 0.89, 0.79 and 0.77 for ecoregion clusters 1 to 3, respectively. Mantel's test on RL
sequences was 0.87 (P < 0.001) when applied to ecoregion clusters using only unique sequences. This value
dropped to 0.82 (P < 0.001) when every strain in the
ecoregion clusters was included in the analysis. The same
test provided a value of 0.27 (P = 0.208) for the distances
matrix based on geographical association of strains. When
the MSP1a Rn repeats, located between R1 and RL were
analyzed, a total of 30, 9, 17 and 3 sequences were
ascribed to ecoregion clusters 1 to 4, respectively. The Rn
consensus sequences contained 14 (45.2%), 17 (54.9%),
17 (54.9%) and 24 (77.4%) identical amino acids in

ecoregions clusters 1 to 4, respectively. The number of R1,
Rn and RL repeat sequences varied between ecoregion
clusters without a clear pattern.

The analysis of the MSP1a microsatellite sequences
resulted in nine different genotypes among A. marginale
strains (Table 1). The different microsatellite sequences
produced SD-ATG distances of between 19 and 29 nucleotides, but the predominant distance was 23 nucleotides
in all regions (Table 1).

Bottom table displays the genetic distances among and between the MSP1a R1 repeat sequences clustered on a geographical basis.
Numbers in bold represent the distance between the MSP1a R1 repeat sequences contained within each ecoregion cluster.

The analysis of MSP1a microsatellite sequences showed
phylogeographic clustering of some genotypes (Table 1).
However, only three of the eight microsatellite genotypes
included in the analysis were exclusive to a particular
ecoregion cluster: genotype A to ecoregion cluster 2,
genoytpe B to ecoregion cluster 1 and genotype F to ecoregion cluster 3. A significant genetic differentiation was
found between ecoregion clusters for MSP1a microsatellite genotype frequencies, with overall FST = 0.16 (P <
0.0001). The ecoregion clusters 1 and 2 were clearly distinct from the other ecoregion clusters, and the largest FST
value (0.28) was found between ecoregion clusters 1 and
4 while significant genetic differences were not found
between ecoregion clusters 3 and 4 (Table 4). To control
for potential confounding effects of geography, we investigated genetic differentiation between broad geographic
regions. This showed that genetic differentiation is mostly
dependent on ecoregion-based clustering of the strains,
with the highest FST value being 0.07 for South America
and the Mediterranean (see Table 4). The AMOVA showed
that 84% of the variance accounted for within-ecoregion
cluster differences, while a geographic-based AMOVA

showed that within-population variation explained less
(73%) of the variance (Table 5).
The effect of MSP1a microsatellite size on gene expression
was analyzed using the sequence derived from Wetumka,
Okeechobee, Idaho and HB-A8 A. marginale strains (Table
6). The results showed that MSP1a expression was lower
in the construct containing the Idaho strain-derived
MSP1a sequence with the lowest SD-ATG distance of 19
nucleotides, while differences were not observed between
constructs containing the MSP1a sequences from
Wetumka, Okeechobee and HB-A8 A. marginale strains
with SD-ATG distances of 23 and 29 nucleotides (Table
6).

Discussion
Vector-borne pathogens have evolved molecular mechanisms of vector-pathogen interactions that involve genetic
traits of both the vector and the pathogen [5,35]. For the
tick-borne pathogen A. marginale, recent studies have
characterized tick and pathogen-derived genes that are
involved in tick-pathogen interactions [2,3,6-9,15]. Phyl-

ogenetic studies using tick and/or pathogen-derived
genetic markers have contributed to our understanding of
the evolution of A. marginale strains and tick-pathogen
relationships [5,6,20]. However, the impact of these studies has been limited by the genetic diversity of genes
involved in tick-pathogen interactions and thus are likely
to reflect pathogen evolution and tick-pathogen relationships [5].
In this study we took a different approach to characterize
the evolution of A. marginale strains. This is the first study
to use remotely sensed vegetation features as a surrogate
of an environmental envelope to which genetic variability
and structure of a single pathogen is associated. Biogeographic research seeks to identify the processes structuring
organism diversity at a variety of geographic and taxonomic scales [36]. Remote sensing is being used increasingly as a tool to discover ecological traits through definite
signatures. NDVI is a measure of the vegetation stress,
thus a time series of NDVI values over a region reflects the
seasonal cycle of vegetation as a surrogate of the seasonal
variation in climate. NDVI and other climate features are
commonly used to detect ecologically suitable areas for
some pathogens and their vectors [37-39]. For example,

Randolph and Rogers [40] indicated that climate has
directed and constrained the evolution of flaviviruses of
the TBE group. Six flaviviruses (SSEV, WTBEV, Russian
TBEV, OHFV, and Kyasanur forest virus) fall within a distinct eco-climatic space defined by factors derived from
thermal and moisture conditions. Herein we showed that
A. marginale MSP1a R1 repeats evolved under positive
selection, were associated with specific ecoregion clusters
and were not arranged according to geographical features.
The different evolutionary pressures operating over different MSP1a repeats was demonstrated previously [6], but
the possibility of using the MSP1a R1 repeat as a biogeographical marker has only been suggested [5]. In contrast,
MSP1a RL repeat sequences, while still linked to a similar
set of ecoregion clusters, did not evolve under positive
selection. Consequently, RL repeat sequences were not
good genetic markers for the characterization of A. marginale biogeography and evolution.
Analysis of MSP1a microsatellite sequences demonstrated
that A. marginale strains are associated with specific ecoregion clusters, thus corroborating the results obtained with
repeat sequences. These results may have a functional significance. It has been shown that the SD-ATG distance

between the ribosome binding site (Shine-Dalgarno
sequence) and the translation initiation codon affects
gene expression in prokaryotes [41]. Little is known about
the regulation of gene expression in A. marginale [6].
However, as shown here in E. coli, the length of the MSP1a
microsatellite could affect the expression of MSP1a, which
varies during A. marginale multiplication in both tick cells
and bovine erythrocytes, thus affecting pathogen infection and transmission [42]. Since MSP1a repeats and microsatellites are unambiguously associated to ecoregion
clusters, these results suggested a new factor that may
affect the efficiency by which different A. marginale strains
are transmitted under different environmental conditions.
A. marginale is an obligate intracellular parasite, which
alternates between the tick vector and the vertebrate host.
Our hypothesis was that the link between pathogen
strains and definite portions of the environmental envelope could reflect the effects of climate on the tick vector.
Temperature and rainfall, which are indirectly captured by
the specific signatures of NDVI, are the main factors affecting the ecology and population dynamics of tick species
[43] and these operate at critical levels of selection of tick
populations, selecting also specific strains of the pathogen. This framework is further obscured by the 'noise' produced by invasive events of the pathogen (by cattle
movement or other factors), or by selection of strains
transmitted mechanically in areas where ticks are eradicated by acaricide application, contributing to the absence
of total consistence between ecoregion clusters and
strains.
Adequate reports exist about distribution, seasonal
dynamics and abundance of R. microplus populations in
the study area, allowing a direct comparison with results
presented herein. Ecoregion cluster 1 contained the R1
repeats with the lowest percentage of conserved amino
acids and the highest positive selection pressure, in areas
with high temperature and medium rainfall. R. microplus
ticks are common in these areas and a strict seasonality in
tick population dynamics has been reported, allowing for
a high selection of tick populations due to winter mortality [44]. Ecoregion cluster 2 contained sites with constant
high temperature and rainfall. In these sites, R. microplus
ticks are abundant throughout the year without marked
seasonality and climate is not a limiting factor in tick mortality [44,45]. In ecoregion cluster 3, tick populations suffer drastic limitations in effectiveness because of low and
inadequate rainfall [46], and this high selection pressure
on tick populations might be adverse for pathogen transmission and selection. The R1 repeat sequences in ecoregion clusters 2 and 3 had higher number of conserved
amino acids and lower positive selection pressure when
compared with R1 sequences in ecoregion cluster 1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/57

Finally, the R1 repeat sequences ascribed to ecoregion
cluster 4 had the highest percentage of conserved amino
acids and the lowest positive selection pressure, recorded
only in sites where R. microplus ticks are absent because of
the low yearly temperature and thus other tick species act
as vectors of A. marginale [18]. The analysis of MSP1a microsatellite sequences also supported differences among all
ecoregion clusters, except for ecoregion clusters 3 and 4
where R. microplus has low prevalence or is absent.
Some R1 repeat sequences such as A, B, D and alpha as
well as microsatellite genotypes C-D, G and H were
present across several ecoregion clusters. These sequences
appeared in A. marginale strains collected in zones where
R. microplus ticks are common (ecoregion clusters 1 and 2)
and in sites, such as central Argentina and southern parts
of the USA, where R. microplus has been prevalent in the
past but has been eradicated [46]. Additionally, these
sequences were also found in sites where other tick vectors
such as Dermacentor spp. are prevalent [18]. These R1
repeats and microsatellite sequences could have evolved
from ancestor pathogen strains transmitted by R. microplus
as the main vector, and then evolved under lower selection pressure, due to pathogen transmission by other tick
species or mechanically. The presence of these sequences
in sites where R. microplus has been historically absent
(that is, north-western USA) and now adapted to transmission by Dermacentor spp. ticks, could be interpreted as
invasive events. The results reported here showed that
lowest selection pressure exist in sites where Dermacentor
spp. ticks are the main biological vectors or where
mechanical transmission is predominant because of eradication of R. microplus. Therefore, R1 repeats are evolving
under high selection pressure only in sites where R. microplus is the main vector and is subjected to selection
because of climate constraints. This hypothesis did not
explain the absence of MSP1a genetic diversity in Australia. Analysis of four A. marginale strains in Australia
revealed the presence of a single repeat type 8 [11]. We
would expect evolution of A. marginale MSP1a towards
different repeat sequences, sharing the consensus
sequence found in ecoregion cluster 1, into which R1 type
8 is ascribed, even in the case of a single invasive event.
Reasons accounting for such a lack of diversity are currently unknown, but the combined pressure exerted by
tick population structure [47,48] the A. centrale vaccine,
acaricide treatments and cattle movement for pathogen
and tick control may have impacted on A. marginale
genetic diversity in Australia [48].
A. marginale exclusively infects cattle and wild ruminants
[2]. Such high host specificity may results in a relatively
low impact of vertebrate host factors on the evolution of
A. marginale strains, thus leaving tick-pathogen interactions as the main contributing factor affecting its biogeog-

raphy and evolutionary history. However, as previously
discussed, cattle movement may have contributed to the
genetic diversity of A. marginale strains worldwide [11].
Nevertheless, the results reported herein may be relevant
in studying the evolution of other vector-borne pathogens. Many vector-borne pathogens, such as some Babesia,
Theileria, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia and Plasmodium species, are
also highly host-specific [49] and vector-pathogen interactions may play a crucial role in their evolution and biogeography [35].

Conclusion
The results reported herein provided the first evidence that
the evolution of A. marginale MSP1a repeat and microsatellite sequences was linked to environmental traits, and
that strains are not geographically related. Different evolutionary pressures acting on A. marginale were found associated with zones where climate and rainfall affect
presence, abundance and dynamics of vector populations.
We hypothesized that some A. marginale strains evolved
under conditions of pathogen biological transmission by
R. microplus, while others may be linked to transmission
by other tick species or to mechanical transmission in
regions where R. microplus is currently absent. The procedures outlined herein could be fundamental toward studying the evolution of other vector-borne pathogens.
