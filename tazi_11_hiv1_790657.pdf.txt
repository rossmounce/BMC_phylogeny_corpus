Abstract
Background: Replicate experiments are often difficult to find in evolutionary biology, as this field is inherently an
historical science. However, viruses, bacteria and phages provide opportunities to study evolution in both natural
and experimental contexts, due to their accelerated rates of evolution and short generation times. Here we
investigate HIV-1 evolution by using a natural model represented by monozygotic twins infected synchronically at
birth with an HIV-1 population from a shared blood transfusion source. We explore the evolutionary processes and
population dynamics that shape viral diversity of HIV in these monozygotic twins.
Results: Despite the identical host genetic backdrop of monozygotic twins and the identical source and timing of
the HIV-1 inoculation, the resulting HIV populations differed in genetic diversity, growth rate, recombination rate,
and selection pressure between the two infected twins.
Conclusions: Our study shows that the outcome of evolution is strikingly different between these two “replicates”
of viral evolution. Given the identical starting points at infection, our results support the impact of random
epigenetic selection in early infection dynamics. Our data also emphasize the need for a better understanding of
the impact of host-virus interactions in viral evolution.

Background
Over the past few decades, evolutionary biology has had
an increasing impact on biomedical research [1-3]. Evolutionary theory can address pertinent questions related
to the control of infectious diseases and particularly to
pathogen virulence [4]. RNA viruses serve as exciting
models for testing this theory because of their potential
for rapid evolution. For instance, a striking feature of
the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) is the
rapid population dynamics resulting in a high degree of
genetic diversity within and between infected individuals
[5,6]. The virus can then capitalize on this genetic diversity to evade a host immune response [7,8]. Nevertheless, host-virus coevolution is also important with
respect to disease progression [9,10]. Viral evolution can
be strongly shaped through antiviral pressure applied by
the host’s immune system [11,12].

A few complications in the study of host-virus coevolution are the different genetic backgrounds of the host
and the genetic diversity of the infecting viral population. The model of monozygotic twins infected synchronically through exposure to the same viral population,
therefore, provides an opportunity to examine the population dynamics of HIV while holding a number of confounding variables constant. Here we exploit HIV-1 as a
model system [13] to examine the population genetic
processes and epigenetic influence on viral evolution.
We collected nucleotide sequence data from the genes
Protease (pro), Reverse Transcriptase (rt), and Envelope
(env) in each monozygotic twin. Using these data, we
estimated relevant population genetic parameters,
including recombination rates, genetic diversity, growth
rates, and selection pressure to compare between the
two host individuals. While these twins have identical
genetic backgrounds and were infected with the same
source of HIV (a common transfusion source collected
from one donor and administered simultaneously to
both twins at birth), they have remarkable differences in
their clinical courses. Twin A is almost normal in terms

of immune system (total average of CD4 T cell counts:
860 cells/μl for twin A; and 319 cells/μl for twin B) and
growth, whereas twin B is almost 5 years delayed in
terms of size and had many complications including a
rare neoplasm.
Recent studies focusing on monozygotic twins are
conflicting on whether HIV evolution can be predictable
[14,15] or unpredictable [16,17], related to the immunological repertoire recruitment in these hosts. Those studies examined immune responses, viral evolution, and
disease outcome in monozygotic twins infected simultaneously with the same virus. They showed that immune
selection driven by dominant sequences in each host
could contribute to specific pathways of HIV-1 evolution. The same natural model is also investigated here;
however we focus on the evolutionary processes acting
on HIV-1 evolution in identical twins by characterizing
the population genetic parameters, including positive
selection in the viral population. If the viral evolution is
predictable, we expect to see similar population
dynamics in both twins. However, if there is significant
epigenetic impact on viral evolution, then we would see
differences in the population dynamics and associated
population genetic parameters.

Results and Discussion
The phylogenetic analysis of env revealed clear evolutionary differences between the viral populations present
in each twin (Figure 1), with twin A showing much
longer branch lengths compared to twin B. The viral
populations from each twin formed reciprocally monophyletic groups with a shared most recent common
ancestor compared to HIV-1 control sequences (lab
reference sequences and the closest sequences identified
in BLAST analyses), as one would expect given the
same source population of HIV. Twin A also had much
high levels of genetic diversity compared to twin B
(Figure 1; Table 1). The phylogenetic network reconstruction of rt (Figure 2) also indicates distinct viral
populations for each twin, with a relatively higher number of internal sampled genotypes in twin A in comparison with twin B. Twin B has a higher number of tip
haplotypes (although not statistically significant with a
P = 0.10; Fisher Exact Test), suggesting that selection is
acting with more force on twin B compared to twin A.
Both phylogenetic and network reconstruction analyses
showed similar results for all genes analyzed (env, pro
and rt) (data not shown). Growth rates were also different between the HIV populations infecting the two
twins with twin A showing a rate, at least, two times
higher than twin B (Table 1). Interestingly, recombination rates were relatively similar except for rt where the
recombination rate (C) was three times higher in twin
A. In both twins the substitution rate was higher than

Page 2 of 9

the recombination rate, as indicated by the low estimates of r (c/μ). The ratio of the per-site rate of recombination to the per-site rate of mutation (c/μ) in all
genes was less than one, indicating that mutation plays
a more significant role in producing novel genetic combinations than recombination and is, therefore, the
major force driving the evolution of these viral populations [see [18]]. Moreover, the BEAST analyses showed
that twin A had a higher relative genetic diversity than
twin B and showed different population dynamics
through time (Figure 3). In env, after a similar starting
point in both twins, the relative genetic diversity
remained constant until just recently when both twins
had a sudden decrease in diversity followed by an exponential increase with twin A increasing to much higher
levels of diversity compared to twin B. In pro, both
twins showed a gradual increase in the relative genetic
diversity until just after drug therapy intervention. Then
twin B starts to increase in diversity before twin A (perhaps because twin B started drug therapy (AZT) two
years prior to twin A (ddI); see methods). Twin A then
has a steeper increase in diversity relative to twin B
before their levels come together at higher levels. In rt,
after a short initial starting point in both twins, twin A
rapidly develops higher diversity than twin B through
time with both patients showing increases in diversity
over the last two years, but twin A maintaining a relatively higher level of diversity compared to twin B.
We also investigated the extent to which natural selection has impacted the viral populations for each twin.
Significant evidence of adaptive selection was detected
in rt from twin B (presumably associated with drug
resistance) and in env from twin A (presumably associated with immune avoidance) using PAML (Table 2).
The Bayesian approach identified 11 positively selected
sites (pP > 0.95) under model M2 and 13 positively
selected sites under model M8 in env from twin A. All
of the 11 sites detected under model M2 were also
found by model M8. Models M2 and M8 also detected
one site under selection in rt from twin B (S162D). This
site is not documented as a drug resistance mutation
site in rt. Even though they are not detected as positively selected sites in rt, we found, in both twins,
M184V mutation that is associated with conferring
resistance to 3TC. Also we detected T215F and K219Q
mutations in rt in twin B, which are associated with
conferring resistance to AZT. There are 26 positions
known to be associated with protease inhibitors [19].
Some amino acid changes were seen in pro in both
twins, but none of these changes are known to confer
drug resistance. A recent study by Nozawa et al. [20]
pointed out the low sensitivity of PAML for detecting
positively selected sites, however this claim has been
rejected by Yang et al. [21] who provide strong support

to the sensitivity of this statistical method for inferring
positive selection in DNA sequences and for comparative analysis of genomic data [22]. Recombination can
confound the inference of selection. We, therefore,
tested for recombination using GARD (Genetic Algorithm for Recombination Detection) that detected a single recombination breakpoint in env for both twins and
in rt for twin B. The REL (Random Effect Likelihood)
selection analyses, that took into account the presence
of recombination inferred through GARD, clearly indicated that in env, positive selection was stronger for
twin A, while no difference was detected in the other
genes (Table 3).

Our goal was to investigate HIV-1 evolution in identical twins infected synchronically at birth with the same
blood transfusion. We found compelling distinctions
between the viral populations from each twin with
respect to their population dynamics, phylogenetic
structure, growth rates, recombination rates, genetic
diversity, and selection pressures. These results were
unexpected due to a combination of having identical
starting points with respect to both the infecting viral
population and the host genetic background. That
coupled with the seemingly limited pathways of evolution for both immune evasion and evolution of drug
resistance [14,23] would lead one to predict similar

actual cloned sequences. The size of the colored squares and circles is proportional to the number of sequences displaying the same genotype.
Each open circle represents putative sequences in the evolutionary pathway. The solid lines on a network represent mutational connections
among unique genotypes with at least a 95% degree of confidence, whereas the dashed lines represent a more tenuous connection. Different
colors in the network were used to represent three sampled time points in the rt sequences for twin A and twin B (green: 09/15/1998, blue: 10/

patterns of genetic diversity and dynamics in viral populations resulting in similar clinical outcomes. Instead, we
found higher growth rates, higher genetic diversity, and
higher recombination in rt in the healthier twin A compared to twin B. We also found sites under diversifying
selection in env in twin A whereas twin B had only one
site under selection in rt (in PAML analysis). Thus, the
higher genetic diversity and higher number of selected
sites in env appear to be associated with slower disease
progression, results concordant with that found in a
broad study of disease progression in infants [24]. Similarly, the twins differed in their population dynamics
and these differed by gene region. The rt and env
regions showed the viral population in the healthier
twin A with higher levels of genetic diversity throughout
the history of infection even when there were significant
shifts in overall levels of diversity. On the other hand,
pro showed the viral population in twin B with a gradual

increase in diversity post drug therapy with a more
rapid increase in twin A that was delayed by the same
time period as the delay in the RT inhibitor (2 years).
This result suggests that the shape of the response to
drug therapy in terms of the HIV population diversity
might be diagnostic of future disease progression, but
further study with larger sample sizes are needed to better test this response as predictive of disease progression. Nevertheless, these twins clearly show very
different responses to infection.
This difference in viral population dynamics is concordant with the differences observed in the clinical courses
in each twin. The immune system in twin A shows CD4 T
cells at an almost normal rate. The immune system in
twin B is depressed, hence no strong selective pressure is
acting upon its virus population to evolve fast [24]. All
these results combined provide strong evidence that, at
least in this case, the replicate evolutionary experiment did

epigenetic factors on viral population dynamics has
diversifying impact over time as the viral populations
undergo independent evolution - even in the face of
similar genetic selection pressures, identical genetic
starting points, and identical host genetic backgrounds
(Figure 1). This epigenetic drift during development can
be either stochastic (especially when impacted by
genetic drift) or determined by environmental factors
[30]. Host-virus interactions in early stages HIV infection are presumed to have a large impact on the disease
course and viral evolution [31-34], yet they are exceptionally difficult to study because researchers are typically not able to design experiments to investigate viral
dynamics at infection. Our study capitalizes on the
infection of monozygotic twins through a common contaminated blood transfusion to demonstrate that even
more complicated epigenetic factors need to be taken
into account in developing hypotheses associated with
genetic diversity, population dynamics, selection pressure and their association with disease progression.

not result in an identical outcome demonstrating the
importance of selective response to random epigenetic factors impacting disease progression [25].
Indeed, some studies in monozygotic twins revealed
increasing epigenetic differences with age [25,26]. Additionally, there is a clear potential for founding effects
upon infection [27], even in the context of a blood
transfusion as the viral population in a shared blood
donation is certainly reduced in genetic diversity and
number compared to infectious virus from an infected
individual. The combination of a reduced effective
population size coupled with strong selective pressure is
a key ingredient for founder effects [28,29], resulting in
populations with very different characteristics as evident
here in both the population dynamics and immunology.
Clearly, the early impact of founder effects and

Conclusions
We used monozygotic twins infected at birth from the
same blood transfusion contaminated with HIV-1 to
study the association of population genetic and phylogenetic diversity with disease progression and clinical outcomes. We documented that these twins had very
different clinical outcomes with twin A being relatively
healthy compared to twin B. Associated with this slower
disease progression in twin A, we found phylogenetic
differences, higher growth rates, and higher genetic
diversity in the HIV population and higher recombination rates in rt. We also found differences in population
dynamics across all three gene regions. These differences suggest that epigenetic factors are important in
disease progression and can impact viral genetic population dynamics.
Methods
Patient information

Subjects A and B are monozygotic twins. Due to intrapartum blood loss, they simultaneously received transfusion shortly after birth from a common blood
transfusion source in 1983. The parents were notified
that the twins were infected with HIV when they were 2
years old and the twins were declared HIV positive in
the same year (1985). At that time, they were both
asymptomatic. No superinfection was reported during
the first five years of age of the twins. Also the twins
did not receive additional transfusions since their birth.
The twins came to NIH when they were 5 years old
(1988). Since then, they have been closely monitored at
NIH. The twins started receiving nucleoside analog
reverse transcriptase inhibitors at ages 5 (Twin B) and 7

(Twin A). In 1988, twin B started AZT therapy because
he was sicker than his brother. Twin A started ddI therapy two years later (1990). Twin A is normal in terms
of immune system and growth. In contrast, twin B is 5
years delayed in terms of size and he presented a rare
neoplasm, more likely due to HIV infection. Blood samples and clinical information were obtained 15 years
after their birth at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda,
MD (1998). The twins subsequently showed extremely
different clinical courses. Samples were collected under
protocols approved by the institutional review boards at
the National Cancer Institute. Written informed consent
was obtained from participants. This research complied
with all relevant federal guidelines and institutional policies. Permission was obtained from the parents of the
patients for utilization of samples and data for research,
analysis and publication.
HIV-1 sequencing

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated
from blood samples by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient density at
650 g for 30 min, and the cell pellets were stored in liquid
nitrogen until use. DNA was extracted from PBMCs using
the PureGene genomic DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) and prepared at optimal concentration
for nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.
Nested PCR amplification of the V1-V5 region of envelope

and extension at 72°C for 1 min, with the final extension at
72°C for 7 min. The PCR products were purified with the
QIA quick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA),
and then cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector using the
TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences were
then analyzed on an ABI PRISM 3130 × l Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). GenBank accession
numbers for the sequences determined in this study are
GQ118464 to GQ118640.
Phylogenetic analysis and network reconstruction

Sequences from each twin were aligned using MAFFT
v5.3 [35] and manually edited using MacClade 4.05 [36].

Tazi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/62

Phylogenetic trees were estimated using the maximum
likelihood approach [37] with nodal support assessed via
bootstrapping (1,000 pseudoreplicates) [38], as implemented in PHYML [39]. We also estimated phylogenies
using Bayesian methods [40] coupled with Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) inference as implemented in MrBayes v3.1.2 [41]. Model selection for these
analyses followed the procedure outlined by Posada and
Buckley [42] and implemented in ModelTest v3.6 (using
PAUP*) [43] under the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) [44]. Two independent BMCMC analyses were
run, each consisting of four MCMC chains (one cold
and three heated). Each Markov chain started from a
random tree and ran for 2.0 × 10 7 cycles, sampling
every 1000th generation. In order to confirm that the
chains converged and mixed well, we monitored the
likelihood scores and compared means and variances of
all likelihood parameters from independent runs using
Tracer v1.4.1 [45]. The relatedness of the twins’ infections was assessed by adding 20 HIV-1 reference
sequences to the phylogenetic analysis: 11 lab reference
strains (HIVU455, HIVELI, HIVSC, HIVHXB2,
HIVJRFL, HIVJRCSF, HIVD31, HIVBRVA, HIVMN,
HIVNY5 and HIVSF2) and the nine closest sequence
matches (Sequence identity: 85%-95%) identified by
BLAST analyses (DQ410259, AF025761, AY247221,
DQ313246, AY247218, AY835759, EU184128,
HQ110637 and DQ410044). Evolutionary relationships
among the sequences in each twin were also assessed
using the method of statistical parsimony [46], as implemented in the software package TCS v1.21 [47]. This
approach allows for the visualization of evolutionary
relationships as a network instead of a bifurcating tree
which is often more appropriate for viral populations
that recombine.
Population genetic parameters

Genetic diversity (θ = 4N e μ; where N e is the effective
population size and μ is the mutation rate per site),
recombination rates (r = c/μ; where c is the recombination chance per site), and growth rates (g) were estimated for each set of genes using the maximum
likelihood coalescent approach implemented in
LAMARC v2.0.2 [48]. Three independent runs were performed for each gene in order to assess the reproducibility of the different parameter estimates. Furthermore,
an estimate of the diversity generated per recombination
(C) was obtained by multiplying r and θ [18].
BEAST analyses

HIV-1 past population dynamics in each twin was
inferred using the Bayesian skyline plot [49] and relaxed
clock (lognormal) models [50] in BEAST v1.4.2 [51].
The rate of substitution was calibrated based on the age

Page 7 of 9

of infection (15 years). The hyperparameter m (number
of grouped intervals) was set up to 1/4 of the sequences
in each dataset. All the Bayesian MCMC output generated by BEAST was then analyzed in Tracer v1.4.1 [45]
to test for convergence and mixing and plot population
demographics.
Selection analyses

The extent of natural selection was inferred by estimating the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (ω = d N /d S ) per site and per gene using the
codon-based nested models M1 (neutral)/M2 (selection),
and M7 (beta)/M8 (beta and ω), as implemented in
PAML v4 [22]. Model likelihoods were compared using
a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) to determine the best-fit
model. The Bayes empirical Bayes approach was applied
to identify the potential sites under diversifying selection
as indicated by a posterior probability (pP > 0.95) [52].
In order to confirm the PAML analysis, additional ω
estimates were also calculated in DataMonkey [53].
Positively and negatively selected sites were identified
using the REL approach [54]. Recombination was taken
into account by screening for recombination breakpoints
using GARD and allowing each recombinant fragment
to have its own phylogenetic tree [55].
