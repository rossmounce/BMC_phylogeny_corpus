CpG site degeneration triggered by the loss of
functional constraint created a highly
polymorphic macaque drug-metabolizing gene,
CYP1A2

Abstract
Background: Elucidating the pattern of evolutionary changes in drug-metabolizing genes is an important subject
not only for evolutionary but for biomedical research. We investigated the pattern of divergence and
polymorphisms of macaque CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes, which are major drug-metabolizing genes in humans. In
humans, CYP1A2 is specifically expressed in livers while CYP1A1 has a wider gene expression pattern in extrahepatic
tissues. In contrast, macaque CYP1A2 is expressed at a much lower level than CYP1A1 in livers. Interestingly, a
previous study has shown that Macaca fascicularis CYP1A2 harbored unusually high genetic diversity within species.
Genomic regions showing high genetic diversity within species is occasionally interpreted as a result of balancing
selection, where natural selection maintains highly diverged alleles with different functions. Nevertheless many
other forces could create such signatures.
Results: We found that the CYP1A1/2 gene copy number and orientation has been highly conserved among
mammalian genomes. The signature of gene conversion between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 was detected, but the last
gene conversion event in the simian primate lineage occurred before the Catarrhini-Platyrrhini divergence. The
high genetic diversity of macaque CYP1A2 therefore cannot be explained by gene conversion between CYP1A1 and
CYP1A2. By surveying CYP1A2 polymorphisms in total 91 M. fascicularis and M. mulatta, we found several null alleles
segregating in these species, indicating functional constraint on CYP1A2 in macaques may have weakened after the
divergence between humans and macaques. We propose that the high genetic diversity in macaque CYP1A2 is
partly due to the degeneration of CpG sites, which had been maintained at a high level by purifying selection, and
the rapid degeneration process was initiated by the loss of functional constraint on macaque CYP1A2.
Conclusions: Our findings show that the highly polymorphic CYP1A2 gene in macaques has not been created by
balancing selection but by the burst of CpG site degeneration after loss of functional constraint. Because the
functional importance of CYP1A1/2 genes is different between humans and macaques, we have to be cautious in
extrapolating a drug-testing data using substrates metabolized by CYP1A genes from macaques to humans, despite
of their somewhat overlapping substrate specificity.

Background
Cytochrome P450 oxidase (CYP) proteins oxidize a wide
variety of substrates. They could metabolize not only
many endogenous substrates such as steroid hormones,
but also exogenous toxins for excretion [1]. In

drug-metabolizing enzymes. Probably, normal function
of drug-metabolizing CYPs in natural habitats would be
detoxication of xenophobic chemicals taken from foods,
especially from plants [2].
Humans have about 60 CYP genes in the genome [3].

and CYP1A2, which are tandemly aligned with 23-kb
interval and head-to-head orientation [4]. The amino
acid sequence identity between the paralogs is > 80%
and their protein structures are supposed to be very
similar, partly accounting for overlapping substrate
selectivity of these enzymes [5]. Human CYP1A2 is constitutively expressed in livers and contributes to the
hepatic metabolism of many important chemical compounds such as caffeine [6]. In contrast, the tissue distribution of human CYP1A1 gene expression is very broad
and its expression is strongly induced by exogenous
compounds, indicating CYP1A2 rather than CYP1A1 is
a major hepatic CYP1A gene in humans. Polymorphisms
in human CYP1A genes have been intensively studied
for medical benefits (e.g., [7]), while a few studies from
an evolutionary standpoint have been conducted for
human CYP1A genes [8,9]. For example, Jorge-Nebert et
al. surveyed the pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several human populations at the
CYP1A1-CYP1A2 locus and found the signature of
selective sweep around the CYP1A1 untranslated region
[9]. However, the role of the selective sweep for human
CYP1A1 evolution remains unclear.
Because macaque monkeys are widely used for testing
drug toxicity in preclinical trials, the genetic similarity
of CYP genes between humans and macaques is important not only for evolutionary research but also for biomedical applications [10]. Unexpected phenotypic
difference between divergent species is one the biggest
concerns in drug development, e.g., [11]. A previous
study has suggested that drug metabolism by CYP1A1/2
was not perfectly conserved among humans, macaques,
and marmosets [12]. Elucidating the cause of phenotypic
differences among primates at a genetic level is an
important task.
Our previous sequence analysis showed that the
region encompassing the first intron and exon 2 of
macaque CYP1A2 had the highest genetic diversities
among randomly selected 54 unlinked autosomal loci
[13]. Because allelic variation of CYP1A2 proteins may
increase a repertory of toxic substrates metabolized by
CYP1A2, it is reasonable to imagine that the high
genetic diversity in macaque CYP1A2 has been maintained by balancing selection, where natural selection
maintains highly diverged alleles having different functions [14,15]. However, other studies also have shown
that the gene expression pattern of CYP1A2 in macaques was quite different from that in humans. The level
of gene expression of macaque CYP1A2 is very low in
all Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus macaques) livers so
far examined [16,17]. The expression level of CYP1A1 is
instead much more abundant in macaque livers. Interestingly, the pattern of CYP1A1/2 protein expression
appears similar between humans and marmosets [12],

indicating a major hepatic CYP1A gene was switched at
some time after the divergence of the human and macaque lineages [17]. The result casts doubt that the balancing selection hypothesis accounts for high CYP1A2
diversity in macaques. However, if macaque CYP1A2
lost its function, the evolutionary history of CYP1A2
should resemble many other neutral loci.
In order to answer the question why macaque
CYP1A2 has unusually high genetic diversity, we first
investigated the long-term evolution pattern of CYP1A
subfamily. Gene conversion between paralogs was examined with particular attention, because gene conversion
between paralogs may create an unusual pattern of polymorphisms in paralogous genes. We found that the last
gene conversion event between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in
the lineages to Catarrhini primates occurred after the
divergence of primates and rodents, and before the
divergence of Catarrhini and Platyrrhini primates. We
further sequenced CYP1A1/2 coding regions of 63 M.
fascicularis and 28 M. mulatta individuals, and found
several deletions and single nucleotide polymorphisms
in macaque CYP1A2 with relatively high frequencies,
which cause premature stop codons. We propose that
macaque CYP1A2 is in the process of pseudogenization,
and rapid degeneration of CpG sites is creating a high
genetic diversity.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of mammalian CYP1A subfamily

We first analyzed the general pattern of molecular evolution in the mammalian CYP1A subfamily. The phylogenetic tree of CYP1A1/2 genes was constructed using
the cDNA sequences registered in the public database
(Figure 1). Although two independent gene duplications
were assigned on the phylogenetic tree, Goldstone and
Stegeman [18] have suggested that intense inter-locus

tree reconstruction. The bootstrap values (%) are shown on the

gene conversion occurred in the lineage of chickens; i.e.,
mammalian CYP1A1/2 genes and chicken CYP1A5/4
genes are orthologous, respectively. We further searched
syntenic regions to the human CYP1A1-CYP1A2 locus
from the draft genome sequences of several vertebrate
genomes. We found that teleost fish (medaka) and
amphibian (xenopus) genomes contained only one
CYP1A gene, while chicken, opossum, and other placental mammalian genomes (human, orangutan, macaque,
mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, cow, horse, dog, and elephant) encompassed two genes in a head-to-head orientation. In addition, a previous study has shown that all
fish CYP1A genes formed a monophyletic cluster [5].
Therefore, gene duplication of CYP1A1/2 was supposed
to occur at some time between the Amphibia-Amniota
divergence and Mammalia-Sauropsida divergence,
around 300-350 Mya [19,20], and the number of genes
has been stable since the gene duplication.
We also investigated whether macaques carry additional copy of CYP1A genes other than CYP1A1/2 in
the genome. The latest draft genome sequence of M.
mulatta (rheMac2) did not contain any other sequence
similar to CYP1A. Furthermore, a previous search for
genes expressed in M. fascicularis livers did not identify
any additional macaque CYP1A paralogs [21], suggesting
that CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are the only CYP1A genes in
macaque genomes.

homogenized the paralogous gene sequences after the
divergence of primates and rodents.
In order to detect gene conversion between CYP1A1 and
CYP1A2, we analyzed the human-mouse quartet gene set
using a maximum likelihood framework. Figure 2A shows

Gene conversion between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2

The pattern of paralogous divergence between CYP1A1
and CYP1A2 genes was further investigated. In order to
grasp an overall picture, we first focused on only human
and mouse genes. Amino acid differences (p-distance)
between human and mouse orthologs and between paralogs for each coding exon are summarized in Table 1.
Considering that the gene duplication of CYP1A1/2
occurred more than 300 Mya and the divergence
between primates and rodents occurred around 80-120
Mya, paralogous genes should have much more diverged
than human-mouse orthologs. Nevertheless, in exon 2
and 5, the average level of protein divergence between
paralogous genes was smaller than that between humanmouse orthologs. The pattern suggests that gene conversion between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 may have

the expected patterns of paralogous gene divergence in
two species when the gene duplication preceded the split
of species. If gene conversion between paralogs does not
occur, a type-N tree in Figure 2A would be observed. On
the other hand, if gene conversion homogenized the two
paralogous sequences, the phylogenetic pattern among the
quartet genes would become a type-C tree in Figure 2A.
Since the two types of trees are unrooted trees, the topology of trees with gene conversion only in one species
would become the same as the type-C tree. In order to
examine the regional heterogeneity of divergence pattern,
we binned exon 2, 3, and 7 into 150-bp-length windows
with 9-bp (3 codons) sliding steps; exon 4, 5, and 6 were
not subdivided because they were shorter than 150 bp. For
each window, likelihood values of the type-N and type-C
trees were maximized using PAML [22]. If gene conversion occurred after the divergence of primates and
rodents, those regions would have a higher probability of
the type-C tree than that of the type-N tree. Between
humans and mice, the first 500 bp of exon 2 and entire
exon 5 had higher likelihood values of the type-C tree
than that of the type-N tree (Figure 2B), indicating gene
conversion had homogenized these regions after the divergence of primates and rodents. The highest log-likelihood
ratio was 39.3 in the window at 237 bp, which corresponded to P < 10-22. The regions under gene conversion
encompassed substrate recognition site (SRS) 1 and 5. We
repeated the analysis using a human-marmoset quartet
set. Interestingly, the high-probability regions of the typeC tree were not observed in the human-marmoset quartets (Figure 2C), suggesting that gene conversion did not
occur in the Catarrhini lineage after the divergence of
Catarrhini and Platyrrhini.
Genetic diversity of CYP1 genes in M. fascicularis

Since gene conversion could not explain the high
genetic diversity of macaque CYP1A2, detailed analyses
on macaque CYP1A1/2 polymorphisms were conducted.
We determined complete coding sequences of CYP1A1
and CYP1A2 genes of 10 and 7 M. fascicularis individuals, respectively, by sequencing PCR amplicons of
genomic DNA. Basic population genetic statistics such
as nucleotide diversity (Ï), number of segregating sites
(S), and Tajimaâs D are summarized in Table 2. CYP1A1
showed less genetic diversity than CYP1A2 both at

synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. Both genes
showed similar level of negative Tajimaâs D values as
those in other loci studied in the previous study (average was -0.68 with 0.64 standard deviation in 27 randomly selected genes [13]). Although negative D
statistics might have been caused by selective force
around the locus such as selective sweep, the prevalence
of negative D statistics in the genome suggested the past
population expansion of M. fascicularis and M. mulatta.
In those samples, four null mutations were segregating
in M. fascicularis CYP1A2. If the function of CYP1A2
were completely lost before the most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) of macaques, mutations would be randomly segregating at nonsynonymous and synonymous
sites and the ratio of per-site nucleotide diversity at
nonsynonymous site to synonymous sites (ÏA/ÏS) would
be close to 1. The ratio of nonsynonymous nucleotide
diversity (ÏA) to synonymous nucleotide diversity (ÏS) in
CYP1A2 was 0.51, much smaller than 1, although larger
than the ratio in CYP1A1 (Ï A /Ï S = 0.12). The ratio
smaller than 1 indicates that the CYP1A2 gene in macaques lost its function after the occurrence of MRCA, or
the function of CYP1A2 is partly retained: i.e., null
alleles have been weakly selected against in macaque
CYP1A2. When we analyzed only individuals that have
both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 sequences (12 chromosomes), the estimated values of Ï were similar to the
values with all samples (0.00075 and 0.00442 in M. fascicularis CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, respectively).
In order to investigate whether the different pattern of
genetic diversity between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes
are simply due to difference in functional constraint
and/or mutation rates, HKA tests were conducted using
human orthologous genes as outgroup genes [23]. M.
fascicularis individuals having both CYP1A1 and
CYP1A2 sequences were analyzed and the test was significant (P = 0.0415), indicating macaque CYP1A2 has
relatively high polymorphism given the level of divergence. The marginal significance in M. fascicularis was
improved (P = 0.0224) when an additional eight M.
mulatta chromosomes were analyzed together.

To elucidate the mechanisms for creating polymorphisms in macaque CYP1A2, we sequenced the first 1166

those samples (Table 3). Among those individuals, 38
and 7 macaques carried null alleles in the coding
regions as heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively.
For the null mutations of high frequency at site 1066,

fascicularis and M. mulatta, the deviation from the
equilibrium was not detected (P = 0.874 and P = 0.753,
respectively; chi-square test). The prevalence of null
alleles and homozygous individuals supports that
CYP1A2 is a dispensable gene in macaques and the
effect of purifying selection on macaque CYP1A2 is considerably weak. Among 65 SNPs in this region, 36 were
M. fascicularis specific, 16 were M. mulatta specific,
and 13 were shared between species. No fixed difference
between species was discovered.
Interestingly, 32 of 65 SNPs were at CpG dinucleotide
sites. It is well known that methylated dinucleotide CG
tends to mutate to CA and TG in mammalian genomes,
probably at > 10 times faster than the background
mutation rate [24,25]. In agreement with this prediction,
30 of 32 mutations at CpG sites were mutations from
CG to CA or from CG to TG, assuming human
CYP1A2 had ancestral alleles. Among those mutations,
20, 9, and 1 were synonymous, nonsynonymous, and
null mutations, respectively. We counted the number of
CpG dinucleotides in the reference M. fascicularis
CYP1A1/2 cDNA sequences (CYP1A1, D17575;
CYP1A2, D86474). Macaque CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 had
41 and 63 CpG dinucleotides in the protein coding
regions, respectively; the macaque CYP1A2 contained
CpG sites about 8% of the coding sequence. Among all
annotated genes in the M. mulatta genome sequence
(RefSeq genes, [26]), the fraction of CpG sites in
CYP1A2 was ranked in the upper 8.3%.
Many of CpG degenerations (GC to TG and GC to
GA) within a gene are nonsynonymous changes and
those CpG sites should be protected by purifying selection from degeneration if the gene is important for survival. In mammalian genomes, GC content at
synonymous sites are also generally higher than that at
intergenic non-coding sites [27]. We therefore hypothesized that the loss-of-function of macaque CYP1A2
(either completely or partially) may have initiated the
degenerative substitutions at CpG sites in the gene. In
order to test this hypothesis, we reanalyzed the polymorphism data of 24 M. fascicularis individuals in 27
genic (exons and adjacent non-coding sequences) and

27 intergenic regions (at least 100 kb away from any
coding regions), which were randomly distributed on
the autosomes and about 40 kb length in total [13]. As
expected, the genic regions harbored more CpG sites
per nucleotide than intergenic regions (P = 0.0047, Wilcoxon test). In Figure 3, nucleotide diversity and fraction
of CpG sites are plotted for intergenic and genic
regions. Statistically significant positive correlation
(Spearmanâs r = 0.45, P = 0.020) was observed in the
intergenic regions, while no significant correlation was
observed in the genic regions (Spearmanâs r = -0.019, P
= 0.93). The results indicate that the level of polymorphisms in intergenic regions is strongly affected by
the number of CpG sites in those regions, whereas the
functionality of genic regions prevents CpG site
degeneration.

Discussion
Natural selection on drug-metabolizing genes

The process of drug metabolism has been under intense
studies for biomedical benefits. Because humans are
only natural organisms utilizing so-called âdrugsâ, the
impact of natural selection on drug metabolizing genes
still remains unclear, except for some cases of insect
herbivores specialized to their host plants [28,29]. Considering that many plant secondary metabolites are oxidized by CYP proteins and endogenous substrates
controlling physiology such as hormones are also metabolized by CYP proteins, it is straightforward to access
the effect of natural selection on the CYP protein diversity. For example, Thompson et al. proposed that the
natural variation in human CYP3A5 is related to the
retention of salt in a body and under natural selection

according to latitudes [30]. A scan of recent selective
sweeps in the human genome also detected a significant
excess of CYP genes among those regions [31]. In macaques, Osada et al. found that CYP3A5 gene was highly
differentiated between M. fascicularis and M. mulatta
compared with other genes, suggesting the action of
natural selection on the gene for local adaptation [13].
In the same study, they also found that CYP1A2 contained unusually high genetic diversity within the macaque species. Although the previous studies have revealed
a weak hepatic expression of macaque CYP1A2, the
weak expression does not necessary imply that macaque
CYP1A2 is not biologically important. The main object
of this study is elucidating the mode of natural selection
on macaque CYP1A2.
Gene conversion between CYP1A genes and effect on
substrate specificity

Because many factors, including gene conversion
between paralogous genes, could create highly polymorphic genes, we first clarified the pattern of molecular evolution of the CYP1A subfamily. Whether CYP1A
subfamily may have expanded or contracted many times
through the process of birth-and-death evolution of
gene families [32], is an interesting question. For example, in CYP2D subfamily, lineage-specific gene losses in
primates were reported [33], but the subfamily also
experienced a large-scale expansion in non-primate placental mammals. We found that many vertebrate species
genomes encoded CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 with the same
head-to-head orientation as the human genome, and
macaques did not harbor any other paralogous CYP1A
genes created by recent gene duplication. A new method
combining a window plot and maximum likelihood successfully detected the signature of gene conversion at
the first 500 bp of exon 2 and entire exon 5, which correspond to SRS1 and SRS5, respectively. Our method is
not sensitive to gene conversion tracts much shorter
than the window size (150 bp), but successfully detected
the gene conversion events in those regions. In addition,
we did not find any signature of gene conversion using
human and marmoset genes, indicating the last gene
conversion event occurred before the divergence of Catarrhini and Platyrrhini. Because gene conversion is supposed to work effectively on young duplicates [34], we
expect the two paralogs in primates continue diverging
since gene conversion ceased. Interestingly, one amino
acid at position 382 in SRS5 is responsible for substrate
specificity of CYP1A1/2 gene to 7-ethoxyresorufin
(382V) and 7-ethoxyresorufin (382L) [35]. The last gene
conversion homogenized SRS5 of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2
and the substrate specificity should have been acquired
after the event. Indeed, both macaque CYP1A1 and
CYP1A2 proteins have 382V, but orangutan has 382V in

Page 6 of 9

CYP1A1 and 382L in CYP1A2, indicating that the mutation from valine to leucine that modified the substrate
specificity fixed after the divergence of human and
macaque lineages and before the divergence of human
and orangutan lineages. In contrast to exon 2 and 5, the
other exons showed much higher paralogous divergence.
The regional heterogeneity of gene conversion pattern
may indicate natural selection diversifying the substrate
specificities of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 has been maintaining the high paralogous divergence in those conversionrepressed regions, as shown in the cases of Drosophila
transporter genes and yeast heat shock protein genes
[36,37].
CYP1A2 gene is dispensable in macaques

In contrast to our initial expectation, we found many
null alleles were segregating both in M. fascicularis and
M. mulatta CYP1A2. The highest allele frequency of
these null alleles was 39% at site 1066 in M. mulatta
(Table 3). Although we previously identified two null
alleles in macaque CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, the null allele
frequencies were less than 1% [38], indicating the null
variants in CYP3A4/5 are strongly selected against by
natural selection in contrast to CYP1A2. Because all M.
fascicularis so far examined had weak gene expression
of CYP1A2, mutations in regulatory regions should have
become fixed in the common ancestors of macaques.
However, it remains unclear whether the initial loss of
gene expression was driven by positive selection under
the âless is moreâ hypothesis [39], or due to the fixation
of neutral or slightly deleterious alleles.
Mechanisms of rapid decay of CpG sites

If macaque CYP1A2 gene is losing its function, why do
we observe the high genetic diversity in populations?
Although loss-of-function generally results in evolutionary patterns similar to patterns under neutrality, the
genetic diversity in macaque CYP1A2 was significantly
higher than CYP1A1, and much higher than the previously investigated background loci [13]. We found that
primate CYP1A2 genes contained a considerable number of CpG sites, which are thought to mutate at much
higher rates than other sites.
A number of mammalian genome studies have
revealed that CpG sites are enriched in genic regions
not only at nonsynonymous sites such as encoding arginine, but also at synonymous sites and introns. The reason why genic regions in mammalian genomes are
enriched with CpG sites is not totally clear, but we
could raise two hypotheses. One is the natural selection
hypothesis, where natural selection is maintaining CpG
sites within genes for the control of transcriptional regulation or integrity of genomes [40]. Another is the substitution bias hypothesis, where biased gene conversion

is maintaining high GC content in genic regions [41]
because of the association between recombination and
gene density [42]. In particular, it was proposed that
inter-locus gene conversion among multi-gene family
members could increase CG content of those genes
[43]. Although the latter mechanism would be important for creating the high GC regions in genomes, it
cannot explain the deficiency of CpG degeneration in
genic regions (Figure 3B), because under the substitution bias hypothesis we should observe many gain of
CG as well as loss of CpG in genic regions. Therefore,
at some extent, purifying selection protecting CpG sites
within genic regions must play an essential role for
maintaining CpG sites.
There are two ways how natural selection is protecting
CpG sites from degeneration. Firstly, natural selection
could keep CpG sites as unmethylated status in germ
line cells, which can be observed in CpG-island associated genes. Secondly, CpG sites are methylated in
germ line cells and tend to degenerate, but the degenerated alleles are removed from populations by purifying
selection. Unfortunately, we could not determine which
scenario is more plausible in the case of macaque
CYP1A2 gene. Future studies investigating the methylation pattern within human and macaque CYP1A genes
in many tissues would answer such questions. With
either scenario, we could predict that once genes with
many CpG sites lose its function, those genes would
start to accumulate many mutations caused by rapid
CpG degeneration.

Conclusions
Our molecular evolution and population genetic study
strongly supports that macaque CYP1A2 is no longer
essential for M. fascicularis and M. mulatta. At some
time after the divergence between humans and macaques, the major hepatic CYP1A gene was changed in the
lineage to macaques. However, CYP1A1 gene expression
pattern in macaques has not been completely switched
to the human CYP1A2 expression pattern; the expression of macaque CYP1A1 is not so abundant without
induction, but strongly induced by omeprazole, a CYP
inducer [49,50]. The alteration of gene expression pattern could be possible by changes in the gene regulatory
region, because CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are aligned in a
head-to-head orientation and shared a promoter region
[4]. At this moment, we do not have any hypothesis
explaining why the change of expression pattern and
loss of function occurred only in the macaque lineage.
Since the last gene conversion events between CYP1A1
and CYP1A2 occurred before the divergence between
Catarrhini and Platyrrhini, the resurrection of function
by gene conversion cannot explain the macaque-specific
gene loss. Because the functional importance of
CYP1A1/2 genes is highly different between humans
and macaques, we have to be cautious in extrapolating a
drug-testing data using substrates metabolized by
CYP1A genes from macaques to humans, despite of
their somewhat overlapping substrate specificities.
Methods
Sequence analysis

Effect of CpG site degeneration at species divergence
level

In this study, our main focus was the effect of CpG
degeneration on genetic diversity within species. However, the same caution should be taken in analyses
between two diverged species, as suggested by Subramanian and Kumar [44]. As an extreme case, imagine
a gene encoding many arginine residues. If the gene
lost its function and those sites are methylated, many
CpG sites start to degenerate and we would observe
the acceleration of nonsynonymous changes relative to
synonymous changes. Such pattern is often interpreted
as the signature of positive selection, but we need to
be careful for interpreting such data [45-47]. Indeed,
when we compare the coding sequences of human and
M. fascicularis reference CYP1A2 sequences, the ratio
of non-synonymous substitution rate to synonymous
substitution rate was 0.445, which was nearly two
times higher than the genome-wide average [48], indicating that, although weakly, CpG degeneration affects
the evolution rate of CYP1A2 at the apparent species
divergence level.

DNA sequences of vertebrate CYP1A1/2 genes were
retrieved from a public database, and analyzed using
MEGA 5 [51]. DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank accession numbers of analyzed cDNA sequences are as follows: macaque CYP1A1 (D17575), macaque CYP1A2 (D86474),
mouse CYP1A1 (AK005000), mouse CYP1A2
(BC018298), rat CYP1A1 (X00469), rat CYP1A2
(BC127476), chicken CYP1A4 (X99453), chicken
CYP1A5 (X99454), and medaka CYP1A (AY297923).
The nucleotide sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE with default parameter setting using the information of amino acid sequences [52]. The phylogenetic
tree of CYP1A1/2 was constructed using the amino acid
sequences with the Dayhoffâs distance matrix and the
bootstrap resampling was performed 1000 times.
Test of gene conversion

Quartet sequences (two paralogous genes from two different species) were used to detect the molecular evolution pattern under gene conversion. The nucleotide
sequence alignments of exon 2, 3, and 7 were binned
into 150-bp-length windows with 9 bp incremental

Uno and Osada BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:283
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/283

steps. Because the nucleotide sequence alignments of
exon 4, 5, and 6 were shorter than 150 bp, they were
analyzed as single windows. For each window, we estimated the log-likelihood values of the type-N and typeC trees using PAML [22].
Resequencing of macaque CYP1A1/2 genes

Whole blood was collected from 63 cynomolgus macaques (31 from Indochina and 32 from Indonesia, 3-8
years of age, 3-5 kg) and 28 rhesus macaques (from
China, 2-3 years of age, weighing 3-5 kg). Genomic
DNA was prepared from these blood samples using
Gentra Puregene Blood kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturerâs instructions. The study
was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Shin Nippon Biomedical
Laboratories, Ltd (Kainan, Japan). Polymorphisms were
identified by PCR amplification, followed by directsequencing. Briefly, PCR was performed in a 20 Î¼L reaction containing 1 ng of genomic DNA, 5 pmole of each
primer, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a thermal
cycler (Applied Biosystems). For exons 2-5 of CYP1A1,
EX Taq HS DNA polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan)
was used. Thermal cycler condition included an initial
denaturation at 95Â°C for 10 min: 30 cycles of 20 s at 95Â°
C, 30 s at 55-60Â°C, and 1 min at 72Â°C, followed by a
final extension step of 5 min at 72Â°C. PCR products
were sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator v3.0 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems), followed by electrophoresis on an ABI
PRISM 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). PCR/
sequencing primers and annealing temperatures for PCR
are listed in Table S1 (Additional File 1).

Software Used
DNA sequences of CYP1A1/2 genes in vertebrate species were analyzed using MEGA 5 [51]. Sequence data
were analyzed using the Sequencher software (Gene
Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Polymorphism data were analyzed using DnaSP 5.0 [53].
