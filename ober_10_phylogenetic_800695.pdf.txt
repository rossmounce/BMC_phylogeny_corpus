Phylogenetic diversification patterns and
divergence times in ground beetles
(Coleoptera: Carabidae: Harpalinae)
Karen A Ober1*, Thomas N Heider1,2

Abstract
Background: Harpalinae is a species rich clade of carabid beetles with many unusual morphological forms and
ecological interactions. How this diversity evolved has been difficult to reconstruct, perhaps because harpalines
underwent a rapid burst of diversification early in their evolutionary history. Here we investigate the tempo of
evolution in harpalines using molecular divergence dating techniques and explore the rates of lineage
accumulation in harpalines and their sister group.
Results: According to molecular divergence date estimates, harpalines originated in the mid Cretaceous but did
not diversify extensively until the late Cretaceous or early Paleogene about 32 million years after their origin. In a
relatively small window of time, harpalines underwent rapid speciation. Harpalines have a relative high net
diversification rate and increased cladogenesis in some regions of the clade. We did not see a significant decrease
in diversification rate through time in the MCCR test, but a model of diversification with two shift points to lower
diversification rates fit the harpaline lineage accumulation through time the best.
Conclusions: Our results indicate harpalines are significantly more diverse and have higher diversification than
their sistergroup. Instead of an immediate burst of explosive diversification, harpalines may have had a long “fuse”
before major lineages diversified during the early Paleogene when other taxa such as mammals, birds, and some
flowering plants were also rapidly diversifying.

Background
Ever since Darwin, biologists have been interested in
using phylogenetic trees to investigate the pattern and
tempo of lineage diversification. We see that the branching patterns in phylogenies contain information about
the processes of speciation and extinction. Molecular
phylogenies of species rich groups supply hypotheses of
evolutionary relationships among higher taxa, and also
allow us to test hypotheses about the tempo and pattern
of diversification [1-4], revealing both the topology of
ancestor-descendant relationships and the tempo of descent among members of a clade. It is clear that organismal diversification rates (speciation minus extinction)
have been variable across lineages and through time,
with some lineages showing slowing rates of lineage

accumulation [5] and others showing rapid diversification [6] or radiations. Radiations are generally defined in
a way that includes rapid cladogenesis from a common
ancestor [7], yielding taxon rich clades. The tempo and
pattern of diversification of many major lineages of
organisms, including insects, remain controversial [8] does macroevolution proceed at a relatively constant
rate, accumulating lineages exponentially, or does it proceed through bursts of speciation triggered by processes
such as adaptive radiation but otherwise remaining relatively constant?
Rapid or explosive diversifications are characterized by
lineages that have diverged in rapid succession within a
relatively short time span. Molecular phylogenies can
display a pattern that characterizes ancient rapid radiations as its signature [9]. The signature can be described
as close temporal spacing of a number cladogenetic or
lineage-splitting events in a phylogeny, such that the
internal branches (internodes) that link taxa together

are very short. Although such a phylogenetic pattern is
to be expected from an ancient rapid radiation, the pattern can also be observed in the case of other factors
involved in phylogenetic reconstruction such as inadequate data, conflict within or among data sets, loss of
phylogenetic signal over time, or data with inappropriate
evolutionary rates [10]. Phylogenies of major lineages of
insects based on morphological and/or molecular data
have sometimes been contentious, often lacking the data
to distinguish between alternative evolutionary relationships [11-15]. The difficulty in confidently resolving
basal splits in these phylogenies may be a result of
insufficient time during cladogenesis to accumulate
strong phylogenetic signal in the data because of rapid
lineage splitting.
The ground beetle (Carabidae) subfamily Harpalinae
may display such a signature of rapid diversification. Harpalinae is the largest subfamily of carabid beetles and
includes about 19,811 species [16], the bulk of the
family’s species-level diversity. Some harpalines exhibit a
number of unusual morphological forms such as an elongated body in the genus Agra, an ant-like form in Calybe,
snail-shell cracking mandibles in Licinus [17], and an
extremely dorso-ventrally flattened body as in Mormolyce. Not only are members of Harpalinae diverse in morphological form, but also they display a variety of unusual
lifestyles including granivory [18], ovoviviparity [19],
symbiosis with ants and termites [20,21], ectoparasitism
of other insects [22,23], specialized host mimicry by ectoparasites [24,25], and arboreality [26]. Resolving the tribal
relationships within the harpalines has been difficult, in
part, because branch lengths at the base of the harpaline
clade are very short in molecular based trees (Figure 1;
[27,28]) and morphological phylogenetic analyses have
not been able to resolve basal relationships within Harpalinae [29]. Evidence from the fossil record that the subfamily Harpalinae underwent an explosive radiation in
the Cretaceous period [26,30-32], and the very short
branches at the base of the harpaline clade in the molecular phylogeny of three nuclear genes point to the possibility that this speciose group represents a rapid radiation
within carabids, and the tribes may have originated
almost simultaneously. Harpalines contain more than 30
times the number of species as Brachininae (655 species),
their sister group and almost 200 times more than the
next closest clade, the austral psydrines (100 species)
[16]. Rapid, ancient radiations are a difficult challenge to
phylogenetic inference [9,33-35] because short interior
branches limit the historical record of early diversification. In Harpalinae, there are also long terminal branches
[28] that are prone to the analytical artifact of longbranch attraction [36].
Using the preferred phylogeny of harpalines and close
relatives [28], molecular sequence data [27,28], and fossil

data, we investigated the timing and tempo of the diversification of harpalines. The aim of this work was to test the
hypothesis that harpalines evolved their incredible diversity
through an explosive radiation shortly after their evolutionary origin. Our goals were to determine (1) the age of
divergence of the major lineages (approximately tribes) of
harpalines, (2) whether the evolutionary history of diversification of the subfamily Harpalinae and its brachinine sister
group depart significantly from a constant rate model, and
(3) whether harpalines and/or brachinines have experienced changes in diversification rates during their evolutionary history indicative of an explosive radiation of
lineages. In this study, we report on the timing and patterns of evolution in the largest subfamily of ground beetles
and its sister group, the brachinine bombardier beetles.

Methods
Phylogenetic tree and molecular sequence data

Using the 28Sbe+wg maximum likelihood tree topology
from Ober and Maddison [28] and DNA sequence data
sets for 18S from Ober [27] and 28S and wingless from
Ober and Maddison [28], we estimated branch lengths
under the maximum likelihood GTR+Γ+I model in
PAUP* [37]. Branch lengths for the all data combined
tree were estimated from the 28S data due to the large
amount of missing data for many taxa. The 28Sbe+wg
likelihood tree [28] represents the best phylogenetic
hypothesis available for Harpalinae. It has the most
extensive taxon sampling for the subfamily and uses a
model of molecular evolution to estimate the phylogeny
from two nuclear genes. Monophyly of Harpalinae is
based on molecular data [27,28,38,39], morphological
data [40], defensive chemical data [41-44], and cytological data [45,46]. Most tribes within the subfamily are
monophyletic, but the relationships among tribes are
not strongly supported [28]. The effects of phylogenetic
uncertainty on divergence dates were not explored in
depth in this study. One BEAST analysis was done
allowing tree topology to be estimated along with other
parameter values. The topology was largely congruent
with the 28Sbe+wg maximum likelihood tree topology
from Ober and Maddison [28] with a few exceptions
noted in Figure 1. A complete list of taxa and DNA
sequence data used in this study from Ober [27] and
Ober and Maddison [28] is in Additional file 1, Table
S1. We estimated divergence dates from combined 18S,
28S and wg data and also from each gene separately. For
separate gene analyses, taxa for which no molecular data
was available were pruned from the tree yielding a 18S
tree with 21 harpaline taxa and 14 outgroups, a wg tree
with 157 harpalines and 16 outgroups, and a 28S tree
with 193 harpalines and 18 outgroups. We used a likelihood ratio test to look for evidence of a molecular clock
in the molecular phylogenies.

Divergence time estimation

Divergence times were estimated using the penalized
likelihood approach provided by the program r8s v.1.71
[47] and a Bayesian relaxed clock method in BEAST
v.1.5.4 [48] for all data combined and separate gene
datasets. For r8s and BEAST analyses, we calibrated several internal nodes (26 in the all data combined, 28S,

and wg data sets and 7 in the 18S data set) based on the
fossil record (Table 1 and Figure 2).
The r8s penalized likelihood method with the TN
algorithm uses semiparametric rate-smoothing to optimize rate changes among branches. Smoothing parameters were estimated by using the fossil-based model
cross-validation feature in r8s [49]. All 26 fossils passed

the cross-validation test and were included in the analysis. The outermost outgroup was pruned from the tree.
Two r8s analyses were done for each data set, one with
the younger fossil dates for each calibration point and
one with the older dates. All nodes ages were free to be
estimated. All nodes for which there was fossil information were constrained to be no older than a maximum
age of 155 (younger dates) or 160 (older dates) My ago,
the fossil age of Carabidae [31,50], except the root node
of the tree which was constrained with a maximum age
of 197 My ago, the age of Adephaga [50], with no minimum age constraint. Minimum age constraints were
applied to nodes according to fossil information (Table
1).
We also inferred divergence dates using a Bayesian
relaxed clock uncorrelated lognormal method in BEAST
for all data combined and the three genes separately.
For the all data combined analysis, we concatenated the
three data sets for all taxa, but created three data partitions for 18S, 28S, and wg. We chose a separate GTR+I
+Γ model with four gamma categories, based on MrModelTest [51]; a Yule process of speciation, and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model of rate variation

for each partition. Model parameters were unlinked
across partitions. For the separate gene analyses, we
applied a GTR+I+Γ model with four gamma categories,
a Yule process of speciation, and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model of rate. The tree topology
prior was fixed for all BEAST analyses except one alldata-combined analysis where the tree topology was
estimated along with other parameter values. The same
calibration points as in the r8s analyses were used
(Table 1). Node constraints were assigned a normal
prior distribution with means equal to the midpoint of
the fossil date and the standard deviations encompassing
the youngest and oldest age of each fossil. A normal distribution was chosen because it allows uncertainty in the
calibration estimates [52]. After an initial period of finetuning the operators, two separate MCMC analyses
were run for 70 million generations for each data set
with parameters sampled every 1000 generations. Independent runs were combined using LogCombiner1.5.4
[53], and the first 20% of the generations from each run
was discarded as burnin. Convergence of the chains was
checked using TRACER 1.4 [54]. The searches achieved
adequate mixing as assessed by the high effective

sampling size (ESS) values for all parameters of 100 or
greater. Node ages and upper and lower bounds of the
95% highest posterior density interval for divergence
times was calculated using TreeAnnotator 1.5.4 and
visualized using FigTree 1.3.1 [55].
Biodiversity estimate

To test if the Harpalinae clade (19,811 species) is more
diverse than its sister clade, the Brachininae (655 species), we determined if the two groups had significantly
different number of extant species using a conservative
test of Slowinsky and Guyer [56].
Diversification rates

Several diversification statistics were run on the chronograms for each clade (Harpalinae and Brachininae) and
for the overall tree. All diversification tests were performed in R using APE [57], GEIGER [58], and LASER
[59].
The overall rates of net diversification for the Harpalinae clade and the Brachininae clade were estimated
from the pruned all-data-combined BEAST and r8s
chronograms using GEIGER based on a pure-birth process of diversification and also with a speciation:extinction rate of 2:1 using the method of Magallón and
Sanderson [60]. The rate estimate took into account the
extant taxa missing from each clade not sampled in the
chronograms.
The relative cladogenesis (RC) statistic, which uses a
broken-stick distribution to identify branches in the tree
ancestral to a greater proportion of extant descendant
lineages than expected by chance [1,58], was used to
calculate the probability that a particular lineage at time
t will have k descendants given the total number of descendants at time 0 (the present). This test detects and
locates unusually rapid shifts in diversification rates by
looking for unusually lineage-rich clades in the cohort
of clades all originating at one slice of time in the tree.
We estimated the RC statistic with Bonferroni correction as implemented in GEIGER for the all-data-combined r8s and BEAST chronograms.
Rates of cladogenesis through time were investigated
in the Harpalinae and Brachininae all data combined
BEAST chronograms using constant rate (CR) test of
Pybus and Harvey [3] that estimates the gamma statistic
(g) of a given chronogram. Under a Yule (pure birth)
process, g values of completely sampled phylogenies
have been shown to fit a standard normal distribution
with mean = 0 [3,61]. Significantly negative values of g
(g < -1.645 for a one-tailed test) are indicative of
decreasing rates of cladogenesis through time (i.e. internal nodes are distributed more toward the root than
expected under a pure birth process). However, incomplete taxon sampling has been shown to inflate the type

Page 6 of 14

I error of the CR test [3]. To correct for the under sampling in our analysis (193 of 19,811 extant harpalines
and 10 of 655 extant brachinines), we used Monte Carlo
constant rate (MCCR) test [3] in which full topologies
for each clade were simulated under the Yule process
and then randomly sub sampled in Mesquite [62] to
generate a corrected null distribution. We compared our
observed g for brachinines and harpalines to the appropriate null distribution based on 1000 simulated trees.
We calculated g using the LASER package in R for each
of these simulated trees and then used the resulting set
of values as our null distribution under incomplete
taxon sampling [57]. For both the MCCR tests, we performed a one-tailed test with a critical value of p = 0.05.
Rates of diversification were evaluated using Lineage
Through Time (LTT) plots, which illustrate the accumulation of lineages over time for the all data combined
BEAST chronograms for the ingroup Harpalinae and its
sister group Brachininae using APE. To evaluate the
effects of incomplete taxon sampling on the slope of the
LTT plot we used 1000 subsampled simulated Yule process brachinine and harpaline trees to construct mean
LTT curves for comparison with the empirical LTT
curves.
We evaluate the fit of six models of diversification
[63,64] in LASER using Akaike Information Criteria
(AIC) and/or hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRTs)
for the full all-data-combined BEAST chronogram, the
harpaline clade and the brachinine clade. Model 1 (Pure
Birth) assumes a pure birth or Yule model of diversification, Model 2 (Birth Death) assumes a constant birth
death model of diversification, Model 3 (SPVAR) specifies a variable speciation rate and constant extinction
rate, Model 4 (EXVAR) specifies a variable extinction
rate and constant speciation rate, Model 5 (yule2rate)
assumes an abrupt change in diversification rate at some
breakpoint in the past, Model 6 (yule3rate) assumes three
different diversification rates with two breakpoints in the
past. For Models 5 and 6 we evaluated the hypothesized
shifts in diversification rate every one million years.

Results
Divergence time estimations of Harpalinae

All three molecular datasets rejected a strict molecular
clock for the tree (18S c2 = 305.49, d.f. = 33, p < 0.001;
wg c2 = 526.47, d.f. = 171, p < 0.001; 28S c2 = 2493.55,
d.f. = 211, p < 0.001).
Phylogenetic relationships of tribes within harpalines
estimated by BEAST from all data combined were largely
congruent with the 28Sbe+wg maximum likelihood tree
topology from Ober and Maddison [28]. For the most
part, tribes and supertribes were monophyletic except for
Perigonini. However, some of the sistergroup relationships of tribes differed between the Ober and Maddison

[28] and BEAST tree (Figure 1). The difference in tree
topology did not affect the estimate of the age of the origin of Harpalinae (102.1 My ago), but the origin of most
of the tribes was estimated to be slightly older than in the
Ober and Maddison [28] tree. Nonetheless, by the
Eocene, 58 My after the origin of the subfamily, all tribes
are present, similar to the timing of diversification estimated from the Ober and Maddison [28] tree.
Our estimate for the origin of Harpalinae ranged from
about 92 My ago to about 153 My ago (Figures 2 and 3,
Tables 2 and 3) depending on the type of analysis and
the gene(s) used to estimate the divergence times. r8s
estimates of divergence times were generally older than
the BEAST estimates, outside the 95% confidence intervals for the BEAST estimates. r8s divergence date estimates for the origin of harpalines from all DNA data
sets were much older (~120 My ago) than to the fossil
record (~91 My ago). Results of divergence date estimates from individual genes showed that the oldest
dates for all nodes were inferred from the wg gene and
the youngest dates for all nodes were inferred from the
18S gene with r8s (Table 2). The results of the BEAST
analyses did not show a clear bias of particular genes for
older or younger date estimates (Table 3).
The combined molecular data suggest harpalines originated approximately 115 MY ago (Tables 2 and 3),
but may not have diversified much until ~30 My after
the origin of the subfamily. Our analyses suggest that
many harpaline tribes probably originated ~80 My ago
with most of the extant genera evolving 25 - 40 My ago.
The average age estimates of most of the tribes imply
that they originated within a 38 My time window (~47 85 My ago) about 30 My after the origin of Harpalinae
(Tables 2 and 3, Figures 2 and 3). Approximately 68 My
elapsed from the origin of harpalines to the time when
all major lineages and tribes are present.
Tempo of diversification

Although the sister groups are the same age and descended from a common speciation event, there is a significant difference (p = 0.03) in species number between
Harpalinae and Brachininae, indicating an increase in
net diversification (speciation minus extinction) within
the harpaline clade. The clade that contains harpalines
is also significantly more diverse (p = 0.008) than the
sister group to brachinines + harpalines, the austral psydrines, which contains only 100 extant species (Table 4).
The estimated overall net diversification rate with a pure
birth model of diversification in brachinines was 0.080 per
My (0.076 per My with 2:1 speciation:extinction rate) with
the BEAST all-data-combined chronogram to 0.056 per
My with the r8s all data combined chronogram, and in
harpalines the estimated overall net diversification rate
with a pure birth model was 0.103 per My (0.10 per My

Page 7 of 14

with 2:1 speciation:extinction rate) with the BEAST chronogram to 0.073 per My with the r8s chronogram.
The RC test indicated a significant difference in cladogenesis rate between harpalines and brachinines. We
located unusually rapid shifts in diversification in the
node subtending Harpalinae and along at least four
basal branches of harpalines (~80 - 120 My ago in the
r8s chronogram, Figure 3, and ~50 - 65 My ago in the
BEAST chronogram). There were also significant
increases in diversification within and the tribe Lebiini,
especially the subtribe Calleidina (Figure 3).
Results of the CR and MCCR tests showed the observed
value of g in the Harpalinae clade was negative (g =
-10.606), which rejects the hypothesis that rates of lineage
accumulation remained constant over time, however,
when compared to the distribution of g statistics of the
simulations, the harpaline g statistic was not statistically
significant (MCCR test: p = 0.98). The brachinine g statistic was not significantly different than zero, and the CR
and MCCR tests do not reject a constant rate of diversification (g = 0.611, CR test: p = 0.27; MCCR test: p = 1.0).
The semilogarithmic LTT plots for the harpaline and
brachinine clades are shown in Figure 4. The accumulation of harpaline lineages did not differ significantly
from a constant rate of diversification early in harpaline
evolution when compared to 1000 simulated Yule process trees (light lines in Figure 4). However, there was a
steep increase in the number of harpaline lineages early
after the origin of the subfamily, approximately at 75
My ago, and a shift in rate at about 41 My ago (arrow
in Figure 4). This was the time period when most harpaline tribes were diversifying according to the BEAST
divergence time estimates. Brachinines showed a fairly
slow but constant rate of lineage accumulation (Figure
4), within or slightly below the range of simulated trees.
For the harpaline clade, a model of two abrupt rate
shifts, Model 6: yule3rate (AIC = -2.60), was chosen
over other constant and variable rate models (Table 5).
A diversification rate decrease (from 0.08 to 0.02) was
estimated to have happened first at 41.34 My ago and
then again at 11.87 My ago (from 0.02 to 0.004) (arrows
in Figure 4). Statistical analyses of the LTT plot for brachinines indicated that a Pure Birth model of constant
rate of diversification (Model 1, AIC = 54.42) could not
be rejected (Table 5). A model of two abrupt rate shifts,
Model 6: yule3rate (AIC = 32.88) best fit the overall tree
with decreases in diversification rates occurring at 40.04
My ago and 11.07 My ago (Table 5).

late Eocene. In a relatively short amount of time (about
35 My), harpalines diversified from just a few lineages
into almost all the major lineages extant today. From
the divergence date estimates, it appears this rapid

diversification was not immediately after the origin of
harpalines, but about 32 My later.
BEAST estimates of divergence dates from all molecular data combined were slightly older than the fossil
record. r8s estimated divergence dates much older that

Estimated age of stem lineage origins within Harpalinae from all-data-combined and18S rDNA, wingless, and 28S rDNA data sets from r8s relaxed clock analyses
using the youngest hypothesized age of the fossil calibration (first number) and the oldest hypothesized age of the fossil calibration (second number) from Table

[27]. The capital letters correspond to clades in Figure 3.

the fossil record (about 40 My) and the BEAST estimates (about 30 My). Differences between the r8s and
BEAST estimates may due to the relaxed clock method
used to infer dates and the prior distributions for the
divergence time of calibration points in BEAST versus
the minimum and maximum age constraints in r8s. We
prefer the dates from the all data combined BEAST analyses as a more accurate estimate of harpaline evolution
based on the partitioned model of molecular evolution
and Bayesian framework. Estimates of divergence dates
from molecular data are subject to several sources of
error. Estimates may be subject to errors in fossil calibration points or topology, inappropriate priors, or invalid clock assumptions, including much more rate
heterogeneity than can be accommodated by the programs we used. The error introduced by finite sequence
data or model misspecification, such as neglect of multiple hits and across site rate variation [65] can cause
spurious results in divergence time estimates. Sources of
error have been reviewed elsewhere [[66-68], among
others]. We did not explicitly explore the effect of differences in tree topology on divergence time estimates.
We assumed the Ober and Maddison [28] 28S+wg maximum likelihood tree was the best phylogenetic hypothesis for harpalines available, but results from the BEAST

analysis of all data combined where topology was also
estimated, did not change our conclusions about the
timing of harpaline origin or the rapidness of diversification of tribes. Our estimates of harpaline divergence
dates are a working hypothesis subject to the addition of
more taxa, molecular data, improved phylogenetic
hypotheses, and fossils yet to be discovered.
Tempo of diversification

Harpalines have had an increase in net diversification
compared to their sister group, the brachinines. It is difficult to tease apart whether this is due to increased speciation or reduced extinction, because the net diversification
rate is simply the difference between speciation and
extinction rates. We tested for a change in extinction rate
through time in harpalines and brachinines, and a change
in extinction rate does not explain the difference in species
number between the sister groups because he estimated
extinction rate for both is the same (0.001). The net diversification rate for harpalines (0.103) is higher than the rate
estimated for explosive diversification of angiosperms
(0.077 per My) [60] and on par with the rapid mammalian
radiation (0.15) [69].
An increase in diversification is evident in the RC test
where several harpaline clades have experienced higher

than usual cladogenesis. The time of increased cladogenesis occurs approximately 50 - 65 My ago, during a
time of incredible faunal and floral turnover in many
plant and animal groups. In contrast, there were not
shifts in diversification in brachinines or austral psydrines. The RC test is sensitive to temporal depth, phylogenetic scope, and nonindependence of diversification
rate shifts [70]. Therefore rate shifts identified by RC
should be interpreted with caution, especially nested
shifts. If a clade is especially diverse, then one or more
of its parent clades will also show significant diversification through a “trickle-down” effect [58]. This may be
what is being observed along the basal braches of Harpalinae, and a conservative interpretation of the RC
results would be to attribute the increase in diversification rate to the shallowest significant branch (marked

with red stars in Figure 4). In this case, there are significant increases in diversification at the base of the harpaline subfamily and within the tribe Lebiini, the largest
tribe of Harpalines with over 4,200 species. Alternatively, a more complex series of radiations may have
taken place sequentially. An increase in diversification
could have taken place over a longer period of time and
shifts in diversification could have occurred over several
nodes or branches.
Evidence of shifts in diversification rates in harpalines
is harder to interpret from the CR and MCCR tests and
the LTT plots. Older lineages have a higher risk of
being extinct, and thus not sampled, than younger ones
(a bias towards more nodes closer to the tips of the
tree). Incomplete taxon sampling can give the appearance of nodes near the root of the tree giving rise to
more extant descendants than nodes near the tips and
are therefore more likely to be included in a small random sample (a bias toward more nodes closer to the
root of the tree) [71,72]. The MCCR test for harpalines
did not indicate that nodes were closer to the root than
expected under a constant rates model after correcting
for incomplete taxon sampling. The taxa included in
our phylogenetic tree did not represent a random subsample of the total harpaline species, as assumed by the

MCCR test with Yule process simulations. Instead, they
most likely represent an oversampling of deeper lineages
and an undersampling of closely related lineages, which
may have affected the conclusions drawn from this test.
Furthermore the MCCR test suffers from low statistical
power [3] and has been shown to have decreased sensitivity in detecting an initial high rate of diversification
followed by a shift to a lower rate [73].
The harpaline LTT plot with simulated constant rate
trees agreed with the results of the MCCR test in that it
did not show significantly different rate shifts from trees
simulated under a Yule process, but the harpaline LTT
plot showed a decrease in diversification rate after about
41 My ago, the period after the origin of tribes.

Although the simulated trees diversified at a constant
rate (resulting in a straight line in a semi-log plot), randomly removing taxa generated an apparent deceleration
of lineage accumulation (Figure 4). As with the MCCR
test, our tree is not a random subsample of harpaline
taxa. This bias may affect how the LTT plot is interpreted. The LTT plot and associated confidence interval
generated by simulations is just one method by which
timing and tempo of diversification can be visualized
and evaluated, other lines of evidence suggest a fairly
rapid accumulation of harpaline lineages in the Paleocene and Eocene.
The shift in diversification rate from a high rate initially
to lower rates later in harpaline evolutionary history are

evident in the results of the tests of models of diversification (Table 5). An increase in extinction rate later in harpaline evolutionary history does not explain the pattern
of high diversification early and declining diversification
through time. The pattern of lineage accumulation
through time rejected a model of changing extinction
rate. The best fitting model for harpalines shows a
decrease in rate at 41 My ago and again at about 12 My
ago. The first rate decrease corresponds well to the end
of tribe diversification estimated in BEAST, and perhaps
the second shift, which is much more subtle signals the
end of a burst of generic diversification, but more taxa
will need to be included to test this hypothesis.
Estimated dates of divergence, the RC test, evidence
from the LTT plot, and models of diversification tests,
seem to suggest a late Cretaceous through middle
Eocene period of rapid diversification in harpalines. The
Paleogene was a time of profound reorganization of
biota, perhaps in part due to a period of warm “greenhouse” climate during the Paleocene/Eocene thermal
maximum or continental fission during the late Cretaceous. The late Cretaceous to middle Eocene is the same
time period when many other plant and animal taxa are
experiencing tremendous changes in evolution from
mass extinctions at the K-T boundary to explosive
radiations in birds [74], mammals [69] and some plants
[75] and insects [6,50,76-78]. Harpaline diversification
occurred just after the angiosperm Cretaceous radiation
130 - 90 My ago, when flowering plants achieved widespread floristic dominance for the first time [79,80]. It
does not appear that harpalines necessarily co-evolved
with angiosperms, but the angiosperm radiation, along
with other biotic and abiotic factors, during this period
provided harpalines with the possibility of novel ecological interactions. Although the vast majority of harpalines
are predatory, the evolving complex angiosperm habitats
may have afforded harpalines with new niches in which
to diversify, especially because some major groups of
harpalines, like the species rich tribe Lebiini, evolved
arboreal lifestyles instead of ground dwelling [81].
Recent studies have proposed that another species rich
predatory insect group, ants, may have also radiated primarily in the late Cretaceous [82] or Paleogene [83].

Conclusions
Harpaline species diversity is remarkable compared to its
relatives and other carabid clades. Their high rates of net
diversification have made them an evolutionary success
story and an important part of many modern ecosystems.
From the dates of divergence estimates, there was a large
amount of rapid speciation in a short amount of time in
the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene, but it does not
appear that it was a particularly explosive radiation

immediately after their evolutionary origin. Instead, harpalines underwent a somewhat elevated bursts of diversification about 30 My after their origin. This suggests that
harpalines may have had a long “phylogenetic fuse” [84]
before tribes and major lineages began to diversify as
seen in birds [74] and mammals [69].
Relationships of tribes and within the carabid subfamily Harpalinae are not strongly supported [27,28]. The
lack of support from the data for deep branches in the
harpaline molecular phylogeny could be explained by a
rapid radiation or cladogenesis during the evolutionary
history of this group. Short internal branches created by
rapid cladogenesis leave a meager record of diversification that is further potentially obscured by long terminal
branches. This explanation was supported in a study
attempting to resolve early metazoan evolution [9] and
supported by Fiala and Sokal’s [85] simulations. They
suggested that short internal branches and long terminal
branches reduces the accuracy with which a phylogeny
can be estimated, hence the resolution that can be
obtained.
The pattern seen in the molecular phylogenetic trees
of short internal nodes at the base of harpalines with
longer terminal branches [27,28] can be explained in
several ways. It may be the case that harpalines did
undergo a burst of diversification during the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene, but the taxon sampling in the
molecular phylogeny was not complete enough to distinguish the pattern clearly. Incomplete taxon sampling
in such a large group makes it difficult to interpret the
results of the constant rate tests and LTT plots as a significant burst of diversification in Harpalinae evolutionary history. It may be the case that harpalines did
diversify rapidly, but it was not as explosive as carabidologists have assumed. On the other hand, the tempo
of harpaline evolution may have been fairly constant
though time with a high (compared to brachinines), but
steady rate of diversification and lineage accumulation,
leading to the large and speciose clade we see today.
Alternatively, the molecular phylogenies inferred from
the three nuclear genes with short basal branches may
be due to the information content and phylogenetic utility of the genes or systematic errors in selecting models
of evolution for phylogenetic inference. In any case, the
inclusion of additional harpaline and brachinine taxa
and new molecular data would help shed light on the
evolutionary history of the Harpalinae and the patterns
and tempo of diversification of this group of beetles.
