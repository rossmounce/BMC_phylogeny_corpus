Abstract
Background: The number of species within the Malagasy genus Lepilemur and their phylogenetic
relationships is disputed and controversial. In order to establish their evolutionary relationships, a
comparative cytogenetic and molecular study was performed. We sequenced the complete
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1140 bp) from 68 individuals representing all eight sportive
lemur species and most major populations, and compared the results with those obtained from
cytogenetic studies derived from 99 specimens.
Results: Interspecific genetic variation, diagnostic characters and significantly supported
phylogenetic relationships were obtained from the mitochondrial sequence data and are in
agreement with cytogenetic information. The results confirm the distinctiveness of Lepilemur
ankaranensis, L. dorsalis, L. edwardsi, L. leucopus, L. microdon, L. mustelinus, L. ruficaudatus and L.

septentrionalis on species level. Additionally, within L. ruficaudatus large genetic differences were
observed among different geographic populations. L. dorsalis from Sahamalaza Peninsula and from
the Ambanja/Nosy Be region are paraphyletic, with the latter forming a sister group to L.
ankaranensis.
Conclusion: Our results support the classification of the eight major sportive lemur taxa as
independent species. Moreover, our data indicate further cryptic speciation events within L.
ruficaudatus and L. dorsalis. Based on molecular data we propose to recognize the sportive lemur
populations from north of the Tsiribihina River, south of the Betsiboka River, and from the
Sahamalaza Peninsula, as distinct species.

Background
Sportive lemurs, genus Lepilemur, are small nocturnal primates endemic to the island of Madagascar. They are
amongst the most widely distributed lemurs, occurring in
almost all natural evergreen or deciduous forest formations on the island (Fig. 1). Because pelage colouration
and other external characteristics are inconspicuous in
sportive lemurs, the early classifications [1,2] based on
these features were disputed until a comprehensive
cytogenetic approach allowed the recognition of six species [3-6]: L. dorsalis, L. edwardsi, L. leucopus, L. mustelinus
L. ruficaudatus and L. septentrionalis. For a seventh, L.
microdon, the karyotype remained unknown. Recently, L.
septentrionalis has been split into two separate species, L.
septentrionalis and L. ankaranensis [7,8] and the karyotype
of L. microdon has been established [9], so that there are
now eight cytogenetically recognized species.
Molecular studies, especially the sequencing of mitochondrial genes, have expanded enormously during the last
decade and have helped to characterise biodiversity and
biogeographic patterns of Malagasy lemurs [10-19]. Such
studies have been particularly fruitful among the family
Cheirogaleidae, in which several new mouse lemur species were described and others elevated from synonymy
[11,18,20], despite the fact that no chromosomal differences were detected within the subfamily Cheirogaleinae
[21-23].
The application of mitochondrial sequence data to the
reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships within the
genus Lepilemur is still rare. However, pioneering studies
using this method have helped to solve taxonomic issues.
Some of the results have confirmed previous conclusions
such as the species status of L. septentrionalis and L. ankaranensis [24], while other studies revealed unexpected
results such as the paraphyly of L. edwardsi from south and
north of the Betsiboka River [12,17], suggesting the existence of two different species [6,12,17]. Within L. ruficaudatus, Roos [25] also detected a paraphyly, with specimens
from Andramasay, north of the Tsiribihina River, being
more closely related to L. edwardsi from south of the Betsiboka River than they are to L. ruficaudatus from Kirindy,

south of the Tsiribihina. The classification of specimens
from south of the Betsiboka as L. edwardsi was, however,
based on erroneous information on the extension of the
species' range as far south as the Tsiribihina [3,5], despite
the report of the existence of L. ruficaudatus north of the
Tsiribihina in the Antsalova region [4]. Later, sportive
lemurs south of the Betsiboka were cytogenetically classified as L. ruficaudatus [26].
In order to obtain a more complete picture of the sportive
lemur's evolution, diversity and biogeography, we conducted a comparative molecular study by combining
mitochondrial sequence data with cytogenetic information from all currently recognized species. We sequenced
the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 68
individuals from 21 geographic locations, and compared
the obtained results with conclusions from cytogenetic
data derived from 99 individuals.

Results
Cytogenetics
Karyograms were established for 99 individuals during
studies performed between 1975 and 2005, with one to
28 specimens from each study population (see additional
files 1 and 2). As shown in additional file 2, the diploid
chromosome number within the genus ranges from 20 to
38, and one to 19 chromosomal rearrangements were
detected between species. Among the eight recognized
species, karyotypes are species specific. Among the different populations of the traditional L. ruficaudatus and L.
dorsalis no differences in diploid chromosome number
and in the R-banding pattern were detected (see additional file 2, Fig. 2, 3, 4). Only one L. ruficaudatus from
Anjahamena was analyzed by Giemsa staining and this
specimen showed a karyotype identical to that of other L.
ruficaudatus (Fig. 4). Further details about diploid chromosome numbers for all species and populations, and
rearrangements among them, are given in additional file
2.

ing all currently recognized species. Among the 68
sequences we detected 39 haplotypes. Uncorrected pairwise differences within the genus range from 0.00–
16.82%, with overlapping intra- and inter-specific differences (intra-specific: 0.00–7.63%, inter-specific: 2.90–
16.82%). Although most inter-specific differences are in
the range of 7.37–16.82%, there are also two exceptions
which show that differences between species can be much
lower (L. ankaranensis – L. dorsalis from Sahamalaza
Peninsula: 4.56–5.35%; L. ankaranensis – L. dorsalis from
Ambanja/Nosy Be: 2.90–3.60%). Intra-specific differences range from 0.00–7.63%. Interestingly, the observed
differences of 5.88–7.63% between the three major populations of L. ruficaudatus, which are separated by wide rivers or large distances, and those found between L. dorsalis
from Sahamalaza Peninsula and from Ambanja/Nosy Be
(5.18–5.88%) exceed those detected between L. ankaranensis and the two L. dorsalis populations, indicating speciation events in L. ruficaudatus and L. dorsalis. Further
details about pairwise differences within and between
species are reported in additional file 3.
Based on the 1140 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b
gene, a population aggregation analysis was performed
with 373 positions serving as diagnostic characters (see
additional file 4). With 163–183 diagnostic characters, L.
mustelinus is clearly separated from the other species. The
remaining species differ in 32–146 diagnostic characters,
with the lowest detected between L. ankaranensis and L.
dorsalis from the Ambanja/Nosy Be population. The three
L. ruficaudatus populations are separated by 64–78 diagnostic characters, comparable to those distinguishing the

Phylogenetic trees reconstructed on the basis of different
algorithms and models of sequence evolution produced
identical tree topologies, with mainly significantly supported branching patterns (Fig. 5). Based on inferred phylogenetic relationships, L. mustelinus was the first species
to split off. The remaining species diverged into two subgroups, of which one contained L. ankaranensis, L. dorsalis,
L. edwardsi, L. microdon and L. septentrionalis, and the other
L. leucopus and L. ruficaudatus. Within L. ruficaudatus three
very distinct clades were observed, corresponding to different geographic locations. In the other subgroup a major
split occurred between L. microdon/L. edwardsi and the
remaining species, which later separated into L. septentrionalis and a group consisting of L. dorsalis and L. ankaranensis. L. dorsalis is further divided into two subclades, with
one containing individuals from Ambanja and Nosy Be,
and the other those from Sahamalaza. Moreover, L. dorsalis emerges as paraphyletic, with specimens from Nosy Be/
Ambanja forming a sister clade to L. ankaranensis.

Discussion
As in many nocturnal mammals, pelage colouration
among sportive lemurs is not a suitable characteristic for
distinguishing among taxa, since it is not well defined and
consistent within taxa. In contrast, cytogenetics or molecular methods such as sequencing of marker genes offer
powerful tools that lead to important insights into the
diversity and phylogeny of several Malagasy lemur genera
[17,19,28,29]. In order to determine the diversity and
phylogenetic relationships among sportive lemur taxa we
conducted a comparative molecular study by combining
mitochondrial sequence information and cytogenetic
data from all currently recognized Lepilemur species.
Based on cytogenetic data, the genus Lepilemur can be
divided into the eight traditionally recognized species, L.
ankaranensis, L. dorsalis, L. edwardsi, L. leucopus, L. microdon, L. mustelinus, L. ruficaudatus and L. septentrionalis.
These differ by several chromosomal rearrangements (3 to
19), with the exception of L. septentrionalis and L. ankaranensis that only one rearrangement separates [7-9] (see
additional file 2). Nevertheless, the phylogenetic positions as well the genetic distances separating these two latter species suggest a separation on species level [24].
Among the three L. ruficaudatus populations and the two
L. dorsalis populations, no chromosomal differences were
detected.
The mitochondrial sequence data also confirm the specific
status of the eight species mentioned above. The genetic
differences detected among them are in the range of those

observed among species of other lemur genera such as
Mirza [11], Microcebus [11,14,18], Hapalemur [10,16] and
Propithecus [13,30]. Interestingly, the distance of 14.47–
16.82% observed between L. mustelinus and the remaining Lepilemur species is the largest detected among lemur
species to date, and exceeds those observed among mouse
lemur species [11,18].
Besides the high genetic differences observed among the
eight Lepilemur species, further large differences were
detected within L. ruficaudatus and L. dorsalis. The molecular data strongly indicate that the three L. ruficaudatus
populations that are distributed in distinct subclades and
separated by high genetic differences of 5.88–7.63% represent different taxa, confirming previous suggestions of a
separate taxon status for specimens from Kirindy, Andramasay and Anjahamena [6,12,17,25,31]. Although no
chromosomal differences were detected among the three
L. ruficaudatus populations, the genetic differences
observed among them are higher than those detected
among some other Lepilemur species (e.g. L. dorsalis – L.
ankaranensis: 2.90–3.60%), as well as from comparable
data from other lemur genera, e.g. Microcebus [11,18].
Thus a separation of the three populations at the species
level is proposed, which is additionally supported by the
fact that these populations occupy ranges between major
biogeographical barriers, such as Madagascar's large rivers
(Fig. 1). These rivers are barriers also for a number of other
species (Tsiribihina: Geogale aurita, Echinops telfairi, Hypogeomys antimena, Mungotictis decemlineata, Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi, Microcebus berthae; Mahavavy: Eulemur
fulvus rufus, Galida elegans occidentalis; Betsiboka:
Oryzorictes talpoides, Avahi occidentalis; Sambirano: Phaner
furcifer parienti and possibly Avahi unicolor).
The L. dorsalis populations of Ambanja and Nosy Be are
closely related and form one clade, indicating both their
common origin and a recent isolation of the island of

Nosy Be. The Nosy Be/Ambanja L. dorsalis and L. ankaranensis together form a sister group to L. dorsalis from
Sahamalaza, indicating a paraphyly of L. dorsalis. These
phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns are also confirmed by RAPD analysis [32], and are similar to patterns
obtained for the genus Propithecus (Indriidae) in that P. v.
coquereli appears to cluster with P. tattersalli instead with
other subspecies of P. verreauxi [13,17,25,30]. Although
ten chromosomal rearrangements were detected between
L. ankaranensis and Nosy Be/Ambaja L. dorsalis (see additional file 2), genetic differences are, at 2.90–3.60%, the
lowest detected among all Lepilemur species (see additional file 3). L. dorsalis from Sahamalaza differs from the
Nosy Be/Ambanja L. dorsalis and L. ankaranensis at 4.56–
5.88%, which is comparable with differences among
other Lepilemur species. Taking together the paraphyly of
L. dorsalis and the large genetic differences among analysed populations, we propose to divide the traditional L.
dorsalis into two distinct species.
Furthermore, the distribution of diagnostic characters
derived from a PAA also suggests a split of the L. ruficaudatus population into three different taxa and the L. dorsalis population into two taxa. This pattern is congruent
with the results of the pairwise distance comparison and
the phylogenetic tree reconstruction.
Since the type locality of L. ruficaudatus and its synonym
L. pallidicauda is simply "Morondava" and no other synonyms are available, the populations north of the Tsiribihina River and between the rivers Betsiboka and
Mahavavy need to be named. Questionable, however, is
the classification of another new species announced by
Edward Louis from Mitsinjo [33], a village located on the
south side of the Mahavavy du Sud River. Whether this
species is the same as the one we describe from the region
between the Betsiboka and Mahavavy rivers needs to be
evaluated by further studies. The locality of the L. dorsalis

type specimen is very imprecisely labelled as "Madagascar". The only possible synonym for L. dorsalis is "Lepidolemur" grandidieri, with the similarly imprecise origin
"North-western Madagascar". Most museum specimens
are from the Ambanja region (see also [11]), and hence
we presume that this is also the case for the L. dorsalis and
L. grandidieri holotypes. Therefore, the population from
the Sahamalaza Peninsula needs to be named. Below, we
describe the sportive lemurs from the regions between the
Betsiboka and Mahavavy rivers, north of the Tsiribihina
River, and the Sahamalaza Peninsula, as three new species:

Description
Pelage coloration is considerably variable in the expression of the colours, possibly as a function of the age of
individuals. Depending on light conditions (daylight or
flashlight at night) the impression of colours may change
subjectively. However, some constant characters are
present, though variably expressed. The face is essentially
grey and the ears are protruding and rounded. Sometimes
there is the impression of a "facemask", in that there may
be a darker diffuse, patch of hair in the middle of the forehead. Above the eyes darker coloured but diffuse stripes
may run upwards to join in the middle of the head. These
confluent stripes continue as one darker and distinct
stripe along the back. The stripe is especially well
expressed until it reaches the middle of the back, and then
continues less prominently to the tail. On the back, the
animals are essentially grey and reddish grey. The middle
part of the back, especially, may show considerable reddish colouration that extends onto both shoulders and

the upper and lower arms. The thigh and lower limb in
general are less reddish than the upper part of the body.
The ventral pelage is light to darker grey. The tail is variably coloured between grey with some red influence to
deep rusty red with negligible grey influence.
Diagnosis
Differs, with the exception of L. randrianasoli and L. ruficaudatus, from all other sportive lemurs in karyotype (2N
= 20, Fig. 4, see additional file 2). In the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, L. aeeclis differs from its
closest relative, L. randrianasoli by 5.88–6.75% and in 64
diagnostic characters. It is slightly larger than L. randrianasoli but is similar in size to L. ruficaudatus (see additional
file 6). Head measurements (length and width) are more
similar to L. ruficaudatus than to L. randrianasoli. However,
hind foot length is more similar to L. randrianasoli than to
L. ruficaudatus, which has the shortest hind foot.
Etymology
L. aeeclis is named in honour of the Association

12 years.
Distribution
The taxon occurs between the Betsiboka and Mahavavy du
Sud rivers. The southern extension of the taxon across the
Mahavavy du Sud River is unknown, and needs further
research.

44°29'E, 19°28'S), Province

Description
Measurements of five males and four females from the
type locality Andramasay are listed in additional file 6.
Diagnosis
Differs, with the exception of L. aeeclis and L. ruficaudatus,
from all other sportive lemurs in karyotype (2N = 20, Fig.

3, see additional file 2). In the complete mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene, L. randrianasoli differs from its closest
relative, L. aeeclis, by 5.88–6.75% and in 64 diagnostic
characters. The species is slightly smaller than L. aeeclis
and L. ruficaudatus (see additional file 5). It differs from
these species by having a narrower but slightly longer
head. These differences in head size are most pronounced
in males. Hind feet are of similar length to L. aeeclis, but
longer than in L. ruficaudatus. Tail length is similar in all
three species.
Etymology
L. randrianasoli is named in honour of our late colleague,
Georges Randrianasolo, who worked from 1970 to 1977
to sample the sportive lemurs necessary for the first taxonomic revision based on cytogenetic studies, and who
walked for two weeks to obtain data and samples from the
L. ruficaudatus from Antsalova.
Distribution
Currently, L. randrianasoli is restricted to the type locality
and Bemaraha. The Tsiribihina River is most likely the
southern limit of the species' range. Further fieldwork is
necessary to determine the northern limit. A possible
northern barrier could be one of the major rivers Manambaho or the Mahavavy du Sud.

lower limbs in general are less reddish than the upper part
of the body. The ventral pelage is generally grey to creamy.
The coloration of the tail is red-brown to deep brown.
Measurements of 2 males and of 4 females from Ankarafa
are listed in additional file 7.

Type locality
Sahamalaza Peninsula (approx. 47°58'E, 14°16'S), Province Mahajanga, Madagascar. Hypodigm: 6 animals from
Ankarafa (47°45'E, 14°22'S), 25 km southeast of the type
locality, for which morphometric measurements have
been taken.

Diagnosis
Differs, with the exception of L. dorsalis and L. leucopus,
from all other sportive lemurs in diploid chromosome
number (2N = 26 Fig. 2, see additional file 2). The karyotypes of L. leucopus and L. sahamalazensis differ in six chromosomal rearrangements, whereas none exists between
the latter and L. dorsalis. In the complete mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene, L. sahamalazensis differs from its closest relatives, L. dorsalis and L. ankaranensis, in 5.18–5.88%
and 4.56–5.35% and by 57 and 50 diagnostic characters,
respectively. The few morphometric data which are available at the moment indicate that L. sahamalazensis is
smaller and lighter than L. dorsalis. The tibia of L.
sahamalazensis seems to be longer than in L. dorsalis,
although tarsus length does not differ.

Description
Pelage coloration is variable, possibly also depending on
age of individuals. Depending on light conditions (daylight or flashlight at night) the impression of colours may
change subjectively. However, some constant characters
are present, though variably expressed. The face is essentially grey. The forehead and the hairline around the ears
are red-brown with sometimes darker diffuse patches. A
dark diffuse line runs from the middle of the upper skull
down the spine, ending in the middle or at the lower part
of the back, but is never present on the tail. The dorsal
pelage, including shoulders and the upper and lower
arms, is predominantly red-brown, whereas the thigh and

L. sahamalazensis is named after the type locality, the
Sahamalaza Peninsula.

Distribution
The species is restricted to the type locality of the
Sahamalaza Peninsula, with the Sambirano River most
likely as its northern boundary. Further field studies are
required to determine the exact distribution range.

Based on our analyses, the classification of sportive
lemurs is now as in additional file 8.

Conclusion
The combination of cytogenetic and molecular
approaches reported here revealed important information
about the diversity and evolution of the sportive lemurs.
Phylogenetic relationships obtained from the mitochondrial sequence data are completely resolved and significantly supported, so that they most likely display the real
evolutionary relationships among the analysed species
and populations. Both methods were able to confirm the
species status of the eight traditionally recognized species,
while mitochondrial sequencing indicated in addition
further cryptic speciation events in L. dorsalis and L. ruficaudatus. Especially in the light of less pronounced differences in pelage colouration and other external
characteristics in nocturnal species compared to diurnal
taxa, molecular studies are imperative. However, no chromosomal differences were detected between the three new
proposed species and their respective sister taxa. Moreover, only a relatively small number of specimens per locality and only one mitochondrial locus were analysed in
this study, so that additional (genetic) data, e.g. from
nuclear DNA loci, are required to confirm the distinct species status of the populations. Furthermore, behavioural
and morphological studies will provide independent data
to delimit the species status of the three new forms. The
discovery of three new possible primate species however,
shows how diverse Madagascar's fauna is and how limited
our knowledge currently still is. Ongoing work in the field
and in the laboratory is urgently required to describe the
complete diversity of sportive lemurs, especially of the different populations representing L. leucopus, L. microdon
and L. mustelinus, and of other Malagasy lemurs. Greater
knowledge of ecological, evolutionary and biogeographic
patterns and processes will provide the necessary basis for
protecting Madagascar's unique biodiversity.

Methods
Fieldwork
Samples from 68 individuals representing all currently
recognized Lepilemur species were collected during field
surveys in Madagascar (Fig. 1). Skin biopsies were taken
under general anaesthesia with a 2 mg/kg injection of ketamine solution (Ketalar® Parke-Davis) or GM2 [34]. A part
of each sample was directly frozen in liquid nitrogen,
while the other part was preserved with a cryoprotector
(DMSO 10%) with the aim of growing fibroblast cultures.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/17

Other tissue samples were stored in 75% ethanol, or in
Queen's lysis buffer [35]. From some animals, 0.5 ml
blood was also taken in heparinized tubes for further lymphoblast cultures. From most animals, standard morphometric measurements, including body mass, head length
and width, head-body length, tail length and hind foot
length, were collected according to [36]. For morphometric comparisons, we included only individuals with a
body mass of at least 660 g, because this is the lower limit
of adult body mass for L. ruficaudatus in the Kirindy forest.
However, morphometric data were collected by different
people under various conditions, and hence we expect
low inter-observer reliability. We therefore did not use
morphometric data for species delimitation, but rather
use them as a tool to present a picture of the taxa. Immediately after recovery from anaesthesia, animals were
released in their respective capture areas.
Cytogenetics
A total of 99 sportive lemur individuals with at least one
specimen per locality was cytogenetically analysed during
studies performed from 1975 till 2005 [8,9,26,37-39].
Chromosomes were prepared either from lymphoblast or
fibroblast cultures, following classical methods
[8,9,26,37-39]. Giemsa staining was performed for all 99
individuals. With the exception of one population, Rbanded and C-banded chromosomes were prepared for at
least one individual (see additional file 2).
Molecular genetics
DNA from the biopsies was extracted using a standard
proteinase K digestion, followed by a phenol chloroform
extraction [40] with minor modifications [41], or isolated
with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit as recommended by the
supplier.

The complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was
amplified via PCR using the oligonucleotide primers CYTLEP-L: 5'-AATGATATGAAAAACCATCGTTGTA-3' and
CYT-LEP-H: 5'-GGCTTACAAGGCCGGGGTAA-3'. Standard, wax-mediated hot-start PCRs were carried out for 40
cycles, each with a denaturation step at 94°C for 60 s,
annealing at 60°C for 60 s, and extension at 72°C for 90
s, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min.
Aliquots of the PCR amplifications were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, PCR products were
cleaned using the Qiagen PCR Purification Kit and
sequenced on an ABI 3100-Avant sequencer using the
BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), primers as indicated above and the internal primers CYT-LEP-L400: 5'-TGAGGACAAATATCATTCTGAGG3' and CYT-LEP-H545: 5'-TGGAGTGCGAAGAATCGGGT3'. The respective sequences were deposited in GenBank
and are available under the accession numbers
DQ108990-DQ109034 and DQ234881-DQ234900.

Sequences were easily aligned by eye due to the lack of
insertions or deletions, and were checked for their potential to be correctly transcribed in order to eliminate data
set contaminations with pseudogenes. For a comprehensive evaluation of the sequence data, we expanded our
data set with orthologous sequences, already deposited at
GenBank, from two L. ruficaudatus and one L. dorsalis. As
outgroup for phylogenetic tree reconstructions, we
selected Phaner furcifer because it displays the most similar
orthologous sequence of all Malagasy lemurs to Lepilemur
[29]. Further details about analysed individuals and
sequences are summarized in Figure 1 and additional file
1.
Uncorrected pairwise differences within and between species and major populations were calculated with PAUP
4.0b10 [42] and DnaSP 3.52 [43].
A population aggregation analysis (PAA) was performed
according to the diagnostic character framework described
in [44]. Accordingly, fixed nucleotide characters provide
the unit for which aggregation of taxonomic units occurs.
For diagnosis, attributes whose fixed unique states unite a
group (populations, species), to the exclusion of other
groups, are considered characters. Polymorphic attributes,
or traits, are indicative of population frequency differences. To identify diagnostic sites, sequences were
imported into MacClade 3.0 [45].
Phylogenetic tree reconstructions were carried out with
the maximum-parsimony (MP), neighbor-joining (NJ)
and maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithms as implemented in PAUP or TREEPUZZLE 5.0 [46]. For MP analyses, all characters were treated as unordered and equally
weighted throughout. A heuristic search was performed
with the maximum number of trees set to 100. NJ and ML
trees were constructed with the TVM + I (= 0.5156) + Γ (=
2.2387) model of sequence evolution as it was selected as
best-fitting model with MODELTEST 3.06 [47], as well as
with standard models. Relative support of internal nodes
was performed by bootstrap analyses with 1,000 replications (MP, NJ), or by the quartet puzzling support values
on the basis of 10,000 puzzling steps (ML).
