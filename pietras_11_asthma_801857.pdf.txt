Abstract
Background: Neuropeptide S Receptor 1 (NPSR1, GPRA, GPR154) was first identified as an asthma candidate gene
through positional cloning and has since been replicated as an asthma and allergy susceptibility gene in several
independent association studies. In humans, NPSR1 encodes two G protein-coupled receptor variants, NPSR1-A and
NPSR1-B, with unique intracellular C-termini. Both isoforms show distinct expression pattern in asthmatic airways.
Although NPSR1-A has been extensively studied, functional differences and properties of NPSR1-B have not yet
been clearly examined. Our objective was to investigate downstream signalling properties of NPSR1-B and
functional differences between NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B.
Methods: HEK-293 cells transiently overexpressing NPSR1-A or NPSR1-B were stimulated with the ligand
neuropeptide S (NPS) and downstream signalling effects were monitored by genome-scale affymetrix expressionarrays. The results were verified by NPS concentration-response and time series analysis using qRT-PCR, cAMP and
Ca2+ assays, and cAMP/PKA, MAPK/JNK and MAPK/ERK pathway specific reporter assays.
Results: NPSR1-B signalled through the same pathways and regulated the same genes as NPSR1-A, but NPSR1-B
yielded lower induction on effector genes than NPSR1-A, with one notable exception, CD69, a marker of regulatory
T cells.
Conclusions: We conclude that NPSR1-B is regulating essentially identical set of genes as NPSR1-A, with few, but
possibly important exceptions, and that NPSR1-A induces stronger signalling effects than NPSR1-B. Our findings
suggest an isoform-specific link to pathogenetic processes in asthma and allergy.

Background
Neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1 also GPRA,
GPR154) was first identified as an asthma susceptibility
gene through positional cloning [1]. The genetic evidence was supported by significant single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) and haplotype associations to
asthma in three separate populations. To date, the
association of NPSR1 to asthma and allergy has been
replicated in seven independent populations [2-8]. Studies have also reported involvement of NPSR1 in
inflammatory disorders of skin and intestine [9,10],
neurally related traits such as sleep and circadian phenotypes [11] and anxiety [12].

NPSR1 is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled
receptor (GPCR) phylogenetically related to other neuropeptide receptors such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurotensin and tachykinin receptors [13]. Upon
stimulation by neuropeptide S (NPS), the natural ligand
for NPSR1, downstream signalling has been shown to
be mediated through intracellular coupling to Gaq and
Gas [14,15]. Several NPSR1 splice variants have been
identified but only two, NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B are
effectively transported to the plasma membrane [16].
These two full-length splice variants differ in their 3’
ends possessing alternate terminal exons 9a or 9b
(Figure 1a) which encodes distinct carboxy-terminal
peptide chains (Figure 1b). The C-terminus is important
for many stages of a GPCR protein lifespan and modifications can affect, e.g., transportation to the cell membrane, anchoring and downstream signalling [17]. Upon
receptor activation, conformational changes reveal

Methods
Cell culture

Figure 1 Schematic picture showing the exonic structure (a)
and the isoforms (b) of NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B. NPSR1-A encodes
the shorter protein isoform with a 29 aa long distinct C-terminus.
NPSR1-B uses an alternate 3’ exon (E9b) in encoding the larger
protein with a 35 aa long distinct C-termini. Shadowed circles in the
C-termini (b) represent putative phosphorylation sites (S = serine, T
= threonine).

phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus. These sites are
phosphorylated by G protein coupled receptor kinases
(GRKs) and can bind GPCR activity regulating proteins,
arrestins. Upon arrestin binding a receptor is targeted
for internalization and recycling, redirected to G-protein
independent signalling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, or degraded [18].
The regulatory mechanisms of alternative splicing are
not yet fully understood for NPSR1. However, it is clear
that NPSR1 isoforms demonstrate distinct expression
pattern in tissues and cells, with NPSR1-A generally
showing a more ubiquitous expression, and that both
isoforms have specific roles in inflammation, as previously shown for NPSR1-B, which is up regulated in
asthmatic airways [1,9,10,16,19]. High total NPSR1
expression is found in murine brain [20] and it has been
suggested that NPSR1 might contribute to an inflammatory phenotype by neurally mediated mechanisms
[21,22]. It has been shown that the receptor potency for
NPSR1 is dependent on the Ile107Asn isoform, where
the NPSR1 Ile107 isoform gives a greater downstream
response upon NPS stimulation than 107Asn [23-25]. In
our study the NPSR1-A and -B constructs contain the
more potent Ile107 isoform.
Even though these data suggest importance of both
receptor signalling pathways, little is known about any
functional disparity between these isoforms. In this
study, we aimed to identify signal properties of NPSR1B and clarify differences of downstream signalling
between the NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B isoforms.

Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were cultured
in MEM+GlutaMAX-1 medium (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biosera), 1%
sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen). Human
epithelial lung carcinoma cells (A549) were cultured in
F-12/D-MEM medium (1:1; Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y)
were cultured in MEM + GlutaMAX-1 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
All cells were kept at 37°C in a humified 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were transiently transfected (Lipofectamin™2000 Reagent, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) with
equal amounts of pCMV-NPSR1-A,- NPSR1-B (construction of the expression vectors has been described earlier)
[16] or an empty pCMV vector control in a ratio of 1:2
(DNA:Lipofectamin). 24 h post transfection cells were
stimulated with NPS (SFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKS)
(Sigma-Genosys LTD, Haverhill, UK or New England
Peptide™, Gardner, MA, USA).
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis and quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR)

Total cellular RNA was isolated with the RNAeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse transcription
was done using the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) or SuperScript™
First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All
experiments were performed in biological duplicates or
triplicates. qRT-PCR was performed using Fast SYBR®
Green technology with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as endogenous controls. Genespecific primers were designed using Primer3 software
(for complete lists of all primer sequences please see
Additional file 1, Table S1). The PCR assays were performed in a total volume of 10 μl, containing 2 ul
cDNA template, 5 ul Fast SYBR ® Green PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and
100 nM of each primer. A 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems) was used according to
manufacturer’s instructions. A dissociation stage was
added to confirm primer specificity. All assays were carried out in technical duplicates or triplicates. Relative
quantification and calculation of the range of confidence
was performed with the comparative ΔΔCT method
[26]. Results are shown as relative expression compared
to NPS stimulated empty vector control cells with error
bars illustrating the standard error of the mean (SEM).

The levels of total NPSR1 mRNA and isoform specific
NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B mRNA were measured with
qRT-PCR to control for equal isoform expression levels
prior to any experiment on all transiently transfected
cells (representative data shown Figure 2b).

analysed with BD FACSCalibur™. Data analysis was
performed with the CellQuestPro software. Background
correction was made for HEK-293 cells incubated with
secondary antibody only. Prior to antibody incubation an
aliquote of the cells were removed and lysed for NPSR1
RNA expression analysis.

Fluorescence based quantification

24 h after transfection transiently NPSR1-A or -B overexpressing HEK-293 cells, stimulated with 1 μM NPS or left
untreated, were incubated 15 min in room temperature
with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the
N-terminal NPSR1 peptide sequence TEGSFDSSGTG
QTLDSSPVA (Quattromed, Tartu, Estonia). The incubated cells were washed with PBS+10% cell dissociation
buffer, Hanks’-based (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) followed by 15 min incubation of a FITC conjugated goat
antimouse secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
The NPSR1 expression on the plasma membrane was

Expression-array sample preparation

For the expression-array experiment, NPSR1-A, -B or an
empty pCMV vector was transiently transfected into
HEK-293 cells and stimulated for 6 h with 2 μM NPS.
Total RNA (see section above) from each sample was
used for cDNA synthesis according to the Affymetrix
protocol. A total of 6 hybridizations (biological duplicates) and scannings (Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner
3000) were carried out using standard Affymetrix protocols for gene expression http://www.affymetrix.com with
the HGU133plus2 array.

Figure 2 NPSR1 protein and mRNA expression in transient transfected HEK-293 cells. Transiently NPSR1-A or NPSR1-B overexpressing HEK293 cells, with or without NPS stimulation, were stained with an N-terminal monoclonal antibody together with a FITC conjugated secondary
antibody, and the fluorescence intensity was measured. The histogram plot (a) shows that the intensity, representing the amount of receptors
expressed on the cell membrane, and the transfection efficiency, represented by the number of counts, is the same between the two isoforms.
From the same experiment NPSR1 mRNA expression was measured showing that the level of NPSR1-A and -B mRNA is similar between the
respective overexpressing cells as well (b). Histogram plot (c) illustrates the intensity of the two isoforms after 2 and 6 hours of NPS stimulation.

Expression-array data analyses

Luciferase reporter assay

Experimental data were quality assessed, pre-processed, and analyzed as previously described [27]
using the statistical software R http://www.R-project.
org by implementing the packages Affy, limma,
HGU133plus2 and kth [28-30]. A B-test (empirical
Bayes shrinkage) was used to extract log-odds of differential expression (B-values). The B-statistics has an
empirical distribution and cut-offs for differential
expression have to be tailored for each experiment. Bvalue >7 was used as cut-off to derive a list of prioritized genes. The expression data is available at http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ with the ArrayExpress
accession: E-MEXP-2782.

Firefly-Luciferase reporter vectors for cAMP/PKA,
MAPK/JNK and MAPK/ERK pathways were purchased
from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD, USA), and used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
HEK-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with one
of the above reporter vectors, a renilla-luciferase reporter vector for normalization (pRL-TK) and either an
empty pCMV vector, NPSR1-A or -NPSR1-B. Cells
were stimulated for 6 hours with 1 μM NPS (or left
untreated). Luciferase assays were carried out with the
Dual-Luciferase ® Reporter Assay System (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized
to the values obtained for renilla luciferase, and
expressed as fold induction relative to cells unstimulated
and transfected with the empty vector.

NPS concentration-response and time series

To refine concentration and time dependency transiently NPSR1-A, -B or empty pCMV vector overexpressing cells were treated either with 0.001, 0.01,
0.1, 1 or 10 μM NPS for 6 h (concentration-response)
or with 2 μM NPS for 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 or 48
h (time-response). To verify the results in other cell
types, A549 and SH-SY5Y transiently overexpressing
NPSR1-A, -B or an empty pCMV vector were treated
with 2 μM NPS for 6 h. mRNA expression was measured with qRT-PCR. Agonist concentration-effect
curve data were fitted to the Hill equation using an
iterative, least squares method (GraphPad Prism, San
Diego, CA, U.S.A), to provide estimate EC50 (the agonist concentration that induces half-maximum effect)
and presented as -log 10 (pEC 50 ) which is normally
distributed.
Measurements of intracellular cAMP accumulation and
Ca2+ mobilization

To assay cAMP accumulation, transiently NPSR1-A or
-B overexpressing HEK-293 cells were 24 h after transfection incubated for 40 min with 200 μM 3-isobutyl1-methylxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
a nonspecific inhibitor of phosphodiesterases [31]. The
cells were then stimulated with 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 or 10
μM NPS for 20 min, or left untreated, and prepared and
stored at -80°C until assayed in six replicas by the
enzyme immunoassay (EIA; 581001, Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For the Ca2 assay, cells were seeded into
96-well plates, transiently transfected with NPSR1-A or
-B and 24 h post-transfection the Fluo-4 NW calcium
assay kit was used (F36205, Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The fluorescence intensity was measured before and
after injection of 1 μM NPS using the Fluostar Optima
microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg,
Germany).

Phosphorylation site-directed mutagenesis

Phosphorylation site directed mutagenesis was performed on previously described pCMV-NPSR1-A and
-NPSR1-B constructs with the QuickChange® II-E sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Primers for each respective mutagenesis were designed
using Stratagene’s web-based QuickChange ® primer
design program http://www.stratagene.com/qcprimerdesigne (primer sequences are found in Additional file 1;
Table S1). When designing the mutant constructs serine
(S) and threonine (T) residues were exchanged for alanine (A) residues as follows: for the NPSR1-A unique
C-terminal; all three S sites and two T sites were
exchanged for A (AΔ5p), the two most N-terminal S
residues and the most N-terminal T residue (AΔ3p) and
the most C-terminal T and S residue (AΔ2p), for the
NPSR1-B unique C-terminal; the only S and T residue
on the -B isoform-tail were exchanged for A (BΔ2p) (for
a schematic picture of the modified C-termini please see
Additional file 2, Figure S1). The modified inserts of all
clones were sequence-verified. HEK-293 cells were
transient transfected and stimulated with 2 μM NPS for
1, 6 and 24 h, gene expression was monitored using
qRT-PCR as described above.
Statistical analysis

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, unless stated otherwise. Student’s t-test was used for parametric comparison between NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B, and p ≤ 0.05 was
regarded as significant

NPSR1-A or -B transiently transfected HEK-293 cells
expressed the isoforms in equal amounts, we measured
the intensity of receptor protein on the plasma membrane with fluorescence based quantification, and
mRNA with qRT-PCR (Figure 2). The FACS analysis
showed that the transfection efficiency between the two
isoforms was identical, with equal number of positive
cell counts, and that the intensity of antibody bound
receptor on each cell was similar both before and after
NPS stimulation (Figure 2a, c). The mRNA levels
between the NPSR1-A or NPSR1-B overexpressing cells
was also comparable and in concordance with the protein expression (Figure 2b). The receptors mRNA
expression levels were stable in the transient transfected
cells up to seventy-two hours post-transfection (data not
shown).
Genome-scale affymetrix expression-arrays

To investigate potential signalling differences between
the two NPSR1 isoforms, we transiently transfected
HEK-293 with NPSR1-A or NPSR1-B. We stimulated
transfected cells and controls with NPS and monitored
downstream signalling effects using the genome-scale
Affymetrix HGU133plus2 expression-arrays. Biological
duplicate samples were assayed and differentially regulated genes were identified by comparing NPS stimulated NPSR1-A or -B transfected cells against NPS
stimulated pCMV-vector transfected cells. A stringent
statistical threshold was used to derive a list of regulated
genes (B > 7), prioritized based on likelihood of differential expression. Using this criterion, a total of 111 genes
were identified as differentially expressed by NPSR1-A
signalling (109 up regulated and two down regulated)
and 55 genes by NPSR1-B signalling (all up regulated).
56 genes were found to be NPSR1-A specific but no
genes were NPSR1-B specific. The 30 most differentially
regulated genes with a more than three-fold up regulation by the NPSR1-A isoform and the corresponding
fold change values for NPSR1-B are listed in Table 1.
The most highly induced gene, CGA, was up regulated
five times more by NPSR1-A compared to NPSR1-B
and only one gene, CD69, was more induced by the -B
isoform. Overall, the expression-array data suggested
that NPS stimulation of NPSR1-A and -B isoforms up
regulated the same genes but that NPSR1-A consistently
yielded a higher induction of genes (Figure 3a).
NPS concentration-response and time series analysis

To verify the results from the expression-arrays and to
investigate if the difference between NPSR1-A and -B
signalling might depend on NPS concentration or
dynamics, we performed concentration- and timeresponse experiments (Figure 3b). HEK-293 cells were
transiently transfected with NPSR1-A, -B or an empty

pCMV-vector control and stimulated with either a fixed
concentration of NPS (2 μM) for 0.5 - 48 h or stimulated with a dilution series of NPS (1 nM-10 μM) for a
fixed time of 6 h. mRNA expression was measured by
qRT-PCR for 11 genes from the expression-array experiment selected as follows; three genes with the highest
relative fold change (CGA, CCL20 and IL8), four genes
only induced by NPSR1-A (PCK1, SERPINB2, AREG
and NTS), transcription factors (NR4A2, EGR1 and
FOS), and CD69 as the only gene more induced by
NPSR1-B in the expression-array experiments.
The concentration-response experiments showed that
overall, both receptor isoforms responded to increased
NPS concentrations with a greater induction of genes,
but with the NPSR1-A isoform consistently mediating
a stronger response. However, stimulation of NPSR1-B
mediated a stronger concentration-response on CD69
and no concentration-response on NTS. The EC 50 values that could be estimated for the effect of NPS on
NPSR1-A (all genes apart from CD69) and on NPSR1B (NR4A2, CGA, AREG, SERPINB2, CCL20 and PCK1)
was generally close to 0.1 μM with the exception of
the effect on NR4A2 which was approximately 10 nM
for NPSR1-A (Table 2). In the NPS-NPSR1 time series
study, genes could be categorised into early (PCK1,
NR4A2, EGR1 and FOS), intermediate (CGA, AREG,
NTS and CD69) and late (CCL20, IL8, SERPINB2)
induced genes. The early induced genes consisted
mainly of transcription factors. Upon induction of
these genes, NPSR1-A mediated a stronger response
than -B at the early peak of expression (0.5-1 h post
NPS stimulation) while at later time points the relative
expression difference diminished and was similar to
NPSR1-B induction of the same genes. The intermediate induced genes all peaked in expression 4-6 h post
NPS stimulation. The relative expression for NPSR1-B
induced genes was overall lower than -A, with one
exception, CD69 and no expression was seen over time
for NTS. The late induced genes peaked in relative
expression 12-24 h post NPS stimulation and the
response was always greater if induced by NPSR1-A.
PCK1, SERPINB2 and AREG, which were exclusively
up regulated upon NPSR1-A stimulation in the gene
expression array experiment, were induced also by
NPSR1-B in the time and concentration series experiment, although with low relative expression. The
results verified and refined the expression-array data
by demonstrating that most genes were induced by
both isoforms but greater induction was obtained
by NPSR1-A, as represented by CGA (Figure 3b: a, b).
As exceptions NTS (Figure 3b: e, f) was not induced
and CD69 (Figure 3b: c, d) was more strongly induced
by NPSR1-B (data for the remaining genes tested are
shown in Additional file 3, Figure S2).

To investigate if differences in regulation of gene
expression between NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B could be
seen in other cell types, we transiently transfected two
additional cell lines, human epithelial lung carcinom
(A549) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y). The
same eleven genes selected for the concentration/timeresponse study were analysed (CGA, CCL20, IL8, PCK1,
SERPINB2, AREG, NTS, NR4A2, EGR1, FOS, and
CD69). Although most genes differentially expressed in
the HEK-293 cells were altered in these cell lines as well
(no expression was however detected for NR4A2, SERPINB2 or AREG in SH-SY5Y cells and SERPINB2 in
A549 cells), the effect of NPS stimulation on relative
gene expression was weaker compared to NPSR1-A or
-B overexpressing HEK-293 cells. However, similarly to
HEK-293 cells, genes regulated by NPSR1-B were

consistently less altered compared to NPSR1-A in both
cell lines (Figure 4a, b).
cAMP and Ca2+ assays

Downstream response of cAMP and Ca2+ was measured
before and after NPS stimulation of NPSR1-A and -B
transiently overexpressing HEK-293 cells. The concentration-response curve for the cAMP assay illustrated
that both -A and -B uses cAMP as a second messenger
but the response generated by NPSR1-A was much
stronger than -B (Figure 5a). The EC50-values for NPSinduced cAMP formation for both NPSR1-A and
NPSR1-B were close to 5 nM, respectively (Table 2). In
the Ca2+ experiment we looked at the release of Ca2+,

NPSR1-A and -B differentially expressed genes as assessed using affymetrix expression-arrays revealed 66 genes induced by the -A isoform (cut
off = ≥2 fold), of which 44 were induced by -B. No unique genes were induced by the -B isoforms. Genes are sorted by fold change, starting
with the most differentially expressed gene as 1 (the numbers on the x-axis correspond to the order of the genes depicted in table 1). (b) qRTPCR verification showing relative expression of CGA, CD69 and NTS after NPS-NPSR1 concentration- and time-response experiments. CGA,
representing the majority of the genes in the expression-array experiment, demonstrate NPSR1-A as an isoform that induces stronger signalling

to NPSR1-B signalling. Data shown as means relative to an NPS stimulated empty vector control ± SEM. * Indicates at which concentrations or

Reporter assays

To further investigate differences seen in gene regulation between NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B, we studied activation of transcription factors representing three signalling
pathways; cAMP/PKA, MAPK/JNK and MAPK/ERK. In

these experiments, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with NPSR1-A, -B or empty pCMV vector
together with an inducible transcription factor responsive luciferase construct. Cells were stimulated with NPS
(1 μM) for 6 h and assayed for the relative luciferase
activity. We observed that NPSR1-A induced a stronger
response than NPSR1-B of the cAMP/PKA pathway (six
fold) and one and a half (ERK) to two fold stronger

Phosphorylation site-directed mutagenesis

To dissect the mechanisms of different regulatory effects
between the NPSR1-A and -B isoforms, we performed
phosphorylation site-directed mutagenesis. The NPSR1A and -B isoforms possess distinct C-termini which,
together with the third intracellular loop, contain phosphorylation sites potentially important for arrestin docking [18]. Phosphorylation occurs predominantly on
serine (S) and threonine (T) residues [32] and, as illustrated in Figure 1b, NPSR1-A carries five unique Cterminal phosphorylation sites, whereas NPSR1-B only
two. We generated NPSR1-A constructs with all five
unique phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal mutated
to alanine (AΔ5p), three sites mutated (AΔ3p) and two
sites mutated (AΔ2p) and NPSR1-B constructs with the
only two unique sites mutated (BΔ2p) (Additional file 2,
Figure S1). HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected
with the mutant constructs or the wild type pCMVNPSR1-A or NPSR1-B, stimulated with NPS for 6 h and
the downstream expression of a subset of genes were
measured with qRT-PCR. The results showed that the
removal of phosphorylation sites did not have any effect
on downstream gene expression (representative gene
shown in Figure 7), suggesting that the significant differential effect between NPSR1-A and -B involves mechanism(s) distinct from simple phosphorylation differences.

Discussion
The increasing number of positive association studies
supports the concept that NPSR1 is mechanistically
involved in asthma and allergy [1-8,33-35], and also in
other diseases [9-12,36]. It is therefore highly important
to understand its functions in more detail. We have previously identified downstream target genes for NPSNPSR1-A signalling using stably NPSR1-A overexpressing HEK-293 cells, and found that many of the up
regulated genes are involved in cellular processes such
as cell proliferation, morphogenesis and immune
responses [27]. Furthermore, we have observed that out
of seven splice variants only the full-length variants
NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B are transported to the plasmamembrane in transiently transfected COS-1 cells [16],
which we can in this study show for NPSR1-A and -B
in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells as well. The
two NPSR1 isoforms differ in the C-terminal where the
last 29 amino acids are unique for NPSR1-A, and the
last 35 for NPSR1-B (Figure 1b). Although there is low
endogenous expression of GPCRs in most native tissues
and cells, generally, NPSR1-A is expressed at a higher

transiently NPSR1-A or -B overexpressing HEK293 cells stimulated with NPS. The cAMP response (a) was measured in a concentration-response
way showing a greater increase of cAMP in NPS-NPSR1-A stimulated cells. In the Ca2+ experiment (b) a fixed dose of 1μM NPS was used and
intracellular Ca2+ accumulation was measured before and after injection (t = 5 s) of NPS. The Ca2+ also illustrates an increased response in the
NPSR1-A overexpressing cells compared to NPSR1-B. cAMP data is shown as mean ± SEM and * indicates significant (p < 0.05) difference

level when compared with NPSR1-B and has a more
ubiquitous expression pattern. However, in some inflammatory conditions, both isoforms are up regulated and
in some cases, e.g., in smooth muscle cells and epithelial
cells in asthmatic airways, NPSR1-B may be even more
abundant than -A [1,9,10]. In inflammatory cells, such
as neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils, both NPSR1A and -B are up regulated, but NPSR1-B is more abundant in, e.g., CD4+ T cells [9,19]. Monocytic cell lines
stimulated with pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as
TNFa and IFNg, generated elevated NPSR1 mRNA
levels [10]. These data not only point towards an important role for NPSR1 in inflammation but also to more
specific and perhaps distinct roles for NPSR1-A and -B.
Since functional differences and properties of NPSR1B have not yet been clearly examined our primary aim
was to investigate this, using a cell line, HEK-293, that

would make the results interpretable in the background
of previous relevant studies on NPSR1. When using
genome-scale expression arrays to investigate downstream target genes of NPS stimulated HEK-293 cells,
transiently transfected with NPSR1-A or NPSR1-B, we
found that target gene expression was regulated in an
isoform-specific manner. We found the same set of
genes to be induced, but NPSR1-A almost exclusively
yielded a stronger induction than NPSR1-B, despite
equal expression of receptor protein on the plasma
membrane (Figure 2a, c). Out of the NPSR1-A induced
genes with a more than two fold differential expression,
half displayed no significant induction by the NPSR1-B
isoform. However, these genes were frequently found to
be regulated by the B isoform as well, when looking at
genes less than two fold differentially expressed. Of the
genes up regulated more than two fold, by both NPSR1-

NPSR1-A or -B overexpressing HEK-293 cells were assayed for transcription factor complex activation of pathways related to GPCR signalling. The
results demonstrate that NPSR1-A is a more efficient activator, with a more than 6 fold change for the cAMP/PKA pathway. Data shown as

A and -B, a striking majority showed stronger induction
by -A. Most of the genes mediated by the NPSR1-A isoform were the same as in our previous expression-array
experiment, using NPS stimulated stably NPSR1-A overexpressing HEK-293 cells [27]. However, some new
downstream target genes were identified in the present
study. These include CCL20, CD69 and PTX3.
Since genes can be early or late responder genes,
and our expression-array data only show a cross-section of genes expressed at six hours, we investigated if
NPSR1-A and -B required different duration of NPS
stimulation to activate gene expression. In the same
manner, we also tested if the concentration-response
effect differed between the isoforms. The results
showed that NPS-NPSR1 regulated gene expression in
a time- and concentration-dependent manner and that
NPSR1-A, even though the EC 50 -values were similar
between the isoforms, was overall a stronger inducer
of gene expression. This supports the fact of a clear
difference in signalling properties between NPSR1-A
and -B. Out of the 11 genes investigated by qRT-PCR,
we only found one gene specifically regulated by
NPSR1-A, Neurotensin (NTS), and one gene showing
greater induction by NPSR1-B, CD69 antigen (CD69)
(Figure 3). NTS is a neuropeptide widely distributed
throughout the central nervous system and it has been
linked both to regulation of circadian rhythms [37]
and IBD-related oncogenesis [38]. CD69 is an early
activation marker of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs
are important in monitoring the balance between Thelper type 2 (TH2) cells and TH1 cells, important for

Page 10 of 13

asthma and other inflammatory disorders [39]. These
observations connect well to the genetic associations
reported for NPSR1. Recently, CD69 was reported to
specifically control the pathogenesis of allergic airway
inflammation [40], and over expression of the NPSR1B isoform in asthmatic airways [1] might thus drive
this pathway toward allergic inflammation.
The majority of protein-coding genes in the human
genome are known to undergo alternative splicing [41]
but it is still not fully understood how the cell- and tissue-specific splicing is regulated [42]. Expression profiling of NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B demonstrates that the
isoforms are differentially expressed in tissues and cells,
suggesting tissue-specific regulation of alternative splicing [1,9,16,19]. Hence, we investigated NPS-NPSR1-A
and -B signalling in lung cells (A549) and neuronal cells
(SH-SY5Y). We identified some differences between cell
lines in terms of which genes are regulated which might
be due to different gene regulatory mechanisms that are
active in different cell types. However, we conclude that
although the induction of these selected genes is not of
the same magnitude as in HEK-293 cells, NPSR1-A is
the stronger activator also in A549 and SH-SY5Ycells.
In these cell lines we could not find specific genes regulated by one isoform alone.
To further study NPS-NPSR1 isoform-specific downstream activity, we investigated intracellular cAMP accumulation and Ca2+ release from each respective isoform.
The response generated by NPSR1-A was clearly higher
for both second messengers. We also looked at activation of downstream transcription factor complexes.
Upon activation of GPCRs the receptor signals both
through the traditional G-proteins, but also through
alternative pathways such as mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) [18]. The results illustrated that both
NPSR1-A and -B induced transcription factors representing cAMP/PKA and MAPK pathways, but that signalling through NPSR1-A gave a stronger response.
These data confirmed our expression-array findings and
suggested that the difference in signalling is already seen
at a second-messenger and transcription factor level.
Upon stimulation of GPCRs, conformational changes
of the receptor activate G proteins. Recent studies have
shown that the C-terminal of the receptor is most likely
not involved in the activation, but rather regulates the
selectivity towards which G protein is utilized [43]. Previous studies demonstrate that NPS-NPSR1-A signals
through Gaq and Gas [14,15] and since activation of
NPSR1-A and -B induces the same genes, it is likely
that they select the same type of G-proteins. After
activation, the GPCRs are rapidly desensitized by phosphorylation and arrestin binding. These events predominantly occur on serine (S) and threonine (T) residues
within the C-terminal and the third intracellular loop

Pietras et al. BMC Pulmonary Medicine 2011, 11:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2466/11/39

[32]. After desensitization, the receptor is internalized
and targeted for degradation, redirected signalling
through G-protein independent pathways (e.g. MAPK)
or recycled back to the membrane [18]. Previous studies
have shown that phosphorylation site-directed mutations
at the C-terminal of GPCRs severely impaired both the
ability to undergo phosphorylation and to recruit
arrestin [44,45]. It has also been demonstrated that conformational changes that improve C-terminal phosphorylation also enhances arrestin binding and endocytosis
[46]. As depicted in Figure 1b, NPSR1-A contains more
than twice as many unique phosphorylation sites as
NPSR1-B. This opens up for the possibility that the -A
isoform undergoes a faster turnover and hence is able to
affect downstream gene expression in a more efficient
way. To test this hypothesis we performed phosphorylation site-directed mutagenesis on both NPSR1-A and -B,
replacing all or a subset of potential phosphorylation
sites with alanine. The results revealed however that the
number of phosphorylation sites in the NPSR1-A and
NPSR1-B C-terminal did not seem to affect the difference in downstream gene regulation observed between
the isoforms, even though minor effects were seen
within each isoform group. The mechanisms behind
isoform specific gene regulation will need further
investigation.

Conclusions
Several studies point towards an important role for
NPSR1 in asthma and allergy, and moreover an explicit
role for the -A and -B isoforms. Prior studies have not
revealed any significantly altered second messenger
response between NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B or investigated differences in downstream gene expression
[16,23]. From this study we conclude that signalling of
NPS-NPSR1-A and -B affect the same pathways but in
an isoform specific manner, identifying NPSR1-A as a
receptor with stronger signalling effects with few, but
possibly important exceptions (such as CD69). In addition, we examined unique phosphorylation sites in the
C-termini as a plausible explanation for discrepancy, but
our data indicated that the differential effect was more
complicated than a simple phosphorylation target difference. Our results suggest an isoform-specific link to
pathogenetic processes in allergic airways.
