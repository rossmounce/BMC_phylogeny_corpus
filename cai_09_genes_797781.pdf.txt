Abstract
Background: Arsenic is known as a toxic metalloid, which primarily exists in inorganic form
[As(III) and As(V)] and can be transformed by microbial redox processes in the natural
environment. As(III) is much more toxic and mobile than As(V), hence microbial arsenic redox
transformation has a major impact on arsenic toxicity and mobility which can greatly influence the
human health. Our main purpose was to investigate the distribution and diversity of microbial
arsenite-resistant species in three different arsenic-contaminated soils, and further study the As(III)
resistance levels and related functional genes of these species.
Results: A total of 58 arsenite-resistant bacteria were identified from soils with three different
arsenic-contaminated levels. Highly arsenite-resistant bacteria (MIC > 20 mM) were only isolated
from the highly arsenic-contaminated site and belonged to Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium,
Arthrobacter, Comamonas, Rhodococcus, Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas. Five arsenite-oxidizing
bacteria that belonged to Achromobacter, Agrobacterium and Pseudomonas were identified and
displayed a higher average arsenite resistance level than the non-arsenite oxidizers. 5 aoxB genes
encoding arsenite oxidase and 51 arsenite transporter genes [18 arsB, 12 ACR3(1) and 21 ACR3(2)]
were successfully amplified from these strains using PCR with degenerate primers. The aoxB genes
were specific for the arsenite-oxidizing bacteria. Strains containing both an arsenite oxidase gene
(aoxB) and an arsenite transporter gene (ACR3 or arsB) displayed a higher average arsenite
resistance level than those possessing an arsenite transporter gene only. Horizontal transfer of
ACR3(2) and arsB appeared to have occurred in strains that were primarily isolated from the highly
arsenic-contaminated soil.
Conclusion: Soils with long-term arsenic contamination may result in the evolution of highly
diverse arsenite-resistant bacteria and such diversity was probably caused in part by horizontal
gene transfer events. Bacteria capable of both arsenite oxidation and arsenite efflux mechanisms
had an elevated arsenite resistance level.

Background
The toxin arsenic in soil and aqueous environments is
considered as one of the prominent environmental causes
of cancer mortality in the World, especially in Bangladesh,
India and China. In recent years, chronic intake of
groundwater with high levels of arsenic has caused
endemic arsenicosis in several provinces of China and
new cases of arsenicosis are continuously emerging [1].
Developing efficient and environment-friendly technologies to remove arsenic from soil and water systems is of
great importance to many countries including China.
Bioremediation of heavy or toxic metal contaminated
sites has been often shown to be more efficient than
chemical and physical methods, especially when stimulating indigenous microbial communities [2].
Bacteria have developed different strategies to transform
arsenic including arsenite oxidation, cytoplasmic arsenate
reduction, respiratory arsenate reduction, and arsenite
methylation [3]. The primary role of some of these transformations is to cope with arsenic toxicity. Arsenite-oxidizing bacteria oxidize arsenite [As(III)] to arsenate
[As(V)] which in many cases is considered primarily a
detoxification metabolism since As(V) is much less toxic
than As(III). In addition, As(V) is negatively charged and
can be easily adsorbed, thus such bacteria have been used
in batch reactors together with immobilizing material for
removing arsenic from waste water [4,5].
As(III) oxidation has been identified in various bacteria
including Pseudomonas [6], Alcaligenes [7], Thiomonas [8],
Herminiimonas [9], Agrobacterium [10], and Thermus [11].
Some of these bacteria were able to use As(III) as the sole
electron donor and grew as lithotrophs. However, characterized heterotrophic arsenite-oxidizing bacteria have not
been shown to gain energy through arsenite oxidation
and probably use As(III) oxidation as a detoxification
mechanism. Arsenite oxidation was catalyzed by a periplasmic arsenite oxidase. This enzyme contains two subunits encoded by the genes aoxA/aroB/asoB (small Fe-S
Rieske subunit) and aoxB/aroA/asoA (large Mo-pterin subunit) respectively [12-14]. Recently aoxB-like sequences
have been widely found in different arsenic contaminated
soil and water systems [15].
Two families of arsenite transport proteins responsible for
As(III) extrusion, ArsB and Acr3p, have been shown to
confer arsenic resistance [12,16,17]. The founding member of the ArsB family, ArsB from E. coli, has been extensively characterized and shown to be a 45 kDa, inner
membrane protein with 12 transmembrane helices
[18,19]. Either ArsB alone or in association with ArsA catalyzes the extrusion of arsenite and antimonite from cells
[20]. In most cases, arsB is co-transcribed with arsC encoding an arsenate reductase. It has been suggested that evo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/4

lution and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of both the
ArsB and the ArsC family may have happened simultaneously in microbial evolution [12]. In many cases, As(III)
is taken up by aquaglyceroporins [21] and extruded by
ArsB [22].
Members of Acr3p transporters showed a function similar
to ArsB, but the two proteins have no significant sequence
similarity. Even though Acr3p is much less characterized,
it has been reported to be present in more phylogenetically distant species than ArsB. Acr3p could be divided
into two subfamilies, Acr3(1)p and Acr3(2)p, based on
their phylogenetic dissimilarities [16,23]. Acr3p appeared
to be more specific and transported only arsenite but not
antimonite [24,25], except that Acr3p of Synechocystis was
able to transport both arsenite and antimonite [26]. The
arsenite transporter gene arsB, ACR3(1) and ACR3(2)
have been identified in various soil bacteria [16]. However, a correlation between genotype and arsenite resistance level has not been found yet.
The impact of microbial arsenite oxidation and arsenate
reduction were reported to influence environmental
arsenic cycles [27]. Understanding the diversity and distribution of indigenous bacterial species in arsenic-contaminated sites could be important for improvement of
arsenic bioremediation. Microbial species with arsenic
biotransforming capabilities had so far not been evaluated in soil systems in China. The objectives of this study
were: (1) Study the distribution and diversity of arseniteresistant and arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in soils with different arsenic-contaminated levels; (2) Investigation of
the different arsenite oxidase and arsenite transporter
genes and attempt to correlate their presence to the
arsenic resistance level of these bacteria.

Results
Distribution and diversity of arsenite-resistant bacteria in
soils with different levels of arsenic
Analysis of microbial species and diversity of arseniteresistant bacteria were performed in 4 soil samples with
high (TS), intermediate (SY) and low (LY and YC) levels
of arsenic contamination. A total of 230 arsenite-resistant
bacteria were obtained and 14 of them showed arsenite
oxidizing abilities. Based on analyses of colony morphologies and 16S rDNA-RFLP, a total of 58 strains were
obtained including 5 arsenite-oxidizing bacteria.

Nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences were used for bacterial identification. Among the analyzed 58 strains, 20
showed 100% nucleotide identities, 33 had 99% identities, 3 (Acinetobacter sp. TS42, Janthinobacterium sp. TS3,
and Delftia sp. TS40) had 98% identities and 2 (Acinetobacter sp. TS11, and Acinetobacter sp. TS39) had 97% identities to sequences deposited in GenBank. Phylogenetic

analysis divided the 58 strains into 23 genera belonging to
5 major bacterial lineages: α-Proteobacteria (5 strains, 2
genera), β-Proteobacteria (15 strains, 6 genera), γ-Proteobacteria (22 strains, 6 genera), Firmicutes (5 strains, 2 genera)
and Actinobacteria (11 strains, 7 genera) (Fig. 1).
Among the 58 strains, 45 were isolated from the highly
arsenic-contaminated soil (TS1-TS45), 8 were from the
intermediate arsenic-contaminated soil (SY1-SY8) and 5
from the low arsenic-contaminated soils (LY1-LY4 and
YC1) (Fig. 1). Acinetobacter, Delftia, Arthrobacter, Microbacterium, Aeromonas, Acidovorax, Ensifer, Janibacter, Janthinobacterium, Klebsiella, Kocuria, Micrococcus, Shewanella and
Thauera were identified from the highly arsenic-contaminated TS soil only. Achromobacter and Williamsia were specific for the SY site. Exiguobacterium particularly existed in
the LY/YC sites. Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas were identified from both the TS and SY sites. Agrobacterium, Rhodococcus and Bacillus were identified from
both the TS and LY/YC sites. Acinetobacter, Comamonas,
Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Delftia, Agrobacterium and
Bacillus were the major arsenite-resistant bacteria in all the
analyzed soil samples (37/58 = 64%).
Arsenite-oxidizing bacteria were phylogentically distant
Five arsenite-oxidizing bacteria were identified including
Achromobacter sp. SY8 (β-Proteobacteria), Agrobacterium
spp. TS43, TS45, LY4 (α-Proteobacteria), and Pseudomonas
sp. TS44 (γ-Proteobacteria) (Fig. 1, square black mark). All
of them were heterotrophic since they could not use CO2
as the sole carbon source and also could not grow with
arsenite as the sole electron donor (data not shown). The
16S rDNA identities of these strains were analysed and
compared to the following related arsenite-oxidizing bacteria. Achromobacter sp. SY8 shared 98% 16S rDNA identity to Achromobacter sp. NT10 (GenBank accession no.
AY027500) [28]. Agrobacterium spp. TS43, TS45, LY4
showed 99%, 98% and 99% 16S rDNA identities to Agrobacterium sp. 5A (GenBank accession no. AF388033) [29]
respectively. The 16S rDNA identity between Pseudomonas
sp. TS44 and Pseudomonas putida strain OS-5 was 97%
(GenBank accession no. AY952321) [30].
Arsenite resistance levels of arsenite-resistant bacteria
vary greatly
The MIC range for arsenite of the 58 strains was from 2
mM to 34 mM (Fig. 1). The numbers of the strains with
MIC values ≥ 2 mM, ≥ 5 mM, ≥10 mM, ≥15 mM, ≥ 20 mM,
≥ 25 mM and ≥ 30 mM were 58, 48, 33, 25, 17, 5 and 2
respectively. Certain correlations were found between the
arsenite resistance levels, the bacterial species and soils
with different arsenic-contaminated levels: (i) All of the 5
strains belonging to Firmicutes showed a very low MICs
[Bacillus spp. TS2 (3 mM), TS27 (5 mM), YC1 (3 mM),
LY2 (3 mM) and Exiguobacterium sp. LY3 (3 mM)]; (ii)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/4

Among the strains belonging to Pseudomonas or Agrobacterium, the MICs of arsenite oxidizers were higher than the
non-arsenite oxidizers [Pseudomonas sp. TS44 (23 mM) vs
Pseudomonas spp. TS5 (9 mM), TS9 (6 mM), SY4 (5 mM),
SY6 (3 mM), SY7 (7 mM); Agrobacterium spp. TS43 (25
mM), TS45 (20 mM), LY4 (20 mM) vs Agrobacterium sp.
TS8 (8 mM)]; (iii) The average MIC of the 5 arsenite oxidizers (20 mM) was higher than the 53 non-arsenite oxidizers (12 mM); (iv) A total of 12 highly arsenite-resistant
bacteria [Acinetobacter spp. TS6, TS14, TS23 and TS42,
Arthrobacter sp. TS22, Comamonas spp. TS37 and TS38,
Rhodococcus sp. TS21, Stenotrophomonas spp. TS15 and
TS23 and 2 arsenite oxidizers (Agrobacterium sp. TS43 and
Pseudomonas sp. TS44)] whose MICs exceeded 20 mM
were only obtained from highly arsenic-contaminated TS
soil; (v) Only intermediate (10 mM < MICs ≤ 20 mM) and
low (MICs ≤ 10 mM) MIC levels of arsenite-resistant bacteria were identified from the intermediate and low
arsenic-contaminated soils; (vi) Strains of the highly
arsenic-contaminated TS site had higher arsenite resistance levels (average MIC = 14 mM) than the strains of the
intermediate (average MIC = 11 mM) and low arsenic
soils (average MIC = 8 mM).
Identification and distribution of the arsenite oxidase gene
aoxB and arsenite transporter genes arsB, ACR3(1) and
ACR3(2)
A total of 5 arsenite oxidase genes and 51 arsenite transporter genes were successfully amplified from 38 strains
using PCR with degenerate primers. The ACR3(1) and
ACR3(2) were amplified in strains of the high and intermediate arsenic-contaminated soils only. In contrast, aoxB
and arsB were found in strains isolated from all three
kinds of arsenic-contaminated environments (Fig. 1).
Strains containing both an arsenite oxidase gene (aoxB)
and an arsenite transporter gene (ACR3 or arsB) showed a
higher average arsenite resistance level than the strains
possessing arsenite transporter genes only [aoxB/ACR3
(20.25 mM) ≈ aoxB/arsB (20 mM) > arsB/ACR3 (14.29
mM) ≈ ACR3 (14.13 mM) > arsB (10.1 mM)].

The aoxB sequences were amplified from all of the five
arsenite oxidizers. No aoxB sequences were amplified
from any of the 53 non-arsenite oxidizers. The deduced
amino acid sequence of aoxB from Achromobacter sp. SY8
showed 95% identity to AoxB from Achromobacter sp. NT10 (GenBank accession no. ABD72610) [15]. The
deduced AoxBs from Agrobacterium spp. TS43, TS45, and
LY4 displayed 95%, 96%, and 95% identities to AoxB of
Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A (GenBank accession no.
ABB51928) [31], and 94%, 96%, and 95% identities to
AoxB from Rhizobium sp. NT26 (GenBank accession no.
AAR05656) [14] respectively. The identity of AoxBs
between Pseudomonas sp. TS44 and Alcaligenes faecalis
NCIB 8687 was only 61% (Fig. 2). Comparison between

sequence substitution.

16S rDNA and deduced AoxB phylogenetic trees indicated
that their evolutionary relationship was similar.
Analyses of arsenite transporter genes using the BlastX
algorithm showed proteins with 71%–80% aa identities
that contained 2 ArsB and 6 Acr3(2)p, 81%–90% aa identities had 10 ArsB, 5 Acr3(1)p and 11 Acr3(2)p, aa identities over 90% included 6 ArsB, 7 Acr3(1)p and 4 Acr3(2)p.
The arsB, ACR3(1), and ACR3(2) were amplified from
both the arsenite oxidizers and non-arsenite oxidizers.
The strains containing 2 arsenite transporter genes simultaneously were Pseudomonas sp. SY7 [arsB and ACR3(1)],
Shewanella sp. TS29, Delftia spp. TS12, TS30, TS33, TS41
and Pseudomonas sp. SY4 [arsB and ACR3(2)], Stenotrophomonas spp. TS28, SY1, SY2, Aeromonas spp. TS26, TS36 and
Pseudomonas sp. TS44 [ACR3(1) and ACR3(2)] (Fig. 1).
Phylogenetic analysis of ArsB, Acr3(1)p and Acr3(2)p
showed a clear separation of the Acr3p and ArsB clusters
(Fig. 3). The Acr3p cluster was further divided into two
phylogenetic groups, Acr3(1)p and Acr3(2)p. The ArsB
cluster was formed by 18 sequences from β-, γ-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes; The Acr3(1)p group had 12 sequences
from γ-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria; The Acr3(2)p
group contained 21 sequences from α-, β-, and γ-Proteobacteria (Fig. 3).
Horizontal transfer of arsenite transporter genes may have
occurred with ACR3(2) and arsB
The arsenite oxidase gene aoxB appeared to be vertically
transferred when comparing the phylogeny of 16S rRNA
genes with those encoding aoxB. In contrast, certain
inconsistency occurred when comparing phylogenetic

trees based on 16S rRNA genes and arsenite transporter
genes. Phylogenetic discrepancies could be detected in 8
ACR3(2) and 1 arsB (Fig. 4): (i) Aeromonas spp. TS26,
TS36 belonging to γ-Proteobacteria based on 16S rDNA
analysis were assigned to the β-Proteobacteria based on
Acr3p(2) sequences; (ii) Stenotrophomonas spp. TS28, SY2,
SY1 belonging to γ-Proteobacteria using 16S rDNA analysis
were assigned to α-Proteobacteria based on Acr3p(2)
sequences; (iii) Comamonas sp. TS32, TS35 and Delftia sp.
TS33 were shown to belong to β-Proteobacteria, but were
assigned to the γ-Proteobacteria clade using Acr3(2)p
sequences; (iv) LY4 belonged to α-Proteobacteria based on
the 16S rRNA gene, but its ArsB was in γ-Proteobacteria
clade (Fig. 4). The phylogenetic discrepancies exhibited
that these 9 arsenite transporter genes were probably
acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Furthermore,
6 of these horizontally transferred ACR3(2) genes were
from the strains isolated from the highly arsenic-contaminated TS soil.

Discussion
The first goal of this study was to determine the distribution and diversity of arsenite-resistant bacteria from soils
with different levels of arsenic contamination. In addition, the ability to oxidize arsenite was further analyzed.
Since the soils were collected from the surface and subsurface zones, only aerobic conditions were used in bacterial
isolation. Thus, only aerobic/facultative aerobic bacteria
were obtained in this study. We identified Acinetobacter,
Comamonas, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Delftia, Agrobacterium, and Bacillus as the major genera of arseniteresistant bacteria in the four arsenic-contaminated soils.

potential horizontally transferred arsB/ACR3(2) genes (B). All sequences used in A's and B's construction are subsets of Fig. 1
and Fig. 3 respectively.
Among them, Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium, Bacillus, and
Pseudomonas species were commonly found at other
arsenic-contaminated sites [16,29,30,32-35]. To our
knowledge, Janibacter, Micrococcus, Thauera, and Williamsia were novel arsenite-resistant bacteria isolated in this
study.
We found that the high arsenic TS site revealed a much
higher diversity of arsenite-resistant bacteria and the
resistance levels observed were also much higher than in
isolates found in the intermediate and low arsenic-contaminated sites. It is a limitation that only one medium
(CDM) was used for bacterial isolation which could result
in the observed differences between sites. The 12 strains
with arsenite MICs > 20 mM were all obtained from the
high arsenic soil. Generally, it has been proposed that
high arsenic contamination is likely to exert a strong selective pressure leading to low microbial diversity [16,32].
However, the TS site used in our study had several hundred years of smelting history [36] which may result in the
evolution of more bacterial species that were already well
adapted at elevated arsenic concentrations. Moreover,
Pennanen et al. [37] reported that at long-term field sites,
soil microbial communities have had time to adapt to
metal and/or metalloid stress. Turpeinen et al. [33] also
found that the diversity of arsenic-resistant bacteria in
higher arsenic-, chromium- and copper-contaminated soil
was higher than that in less contaminated soil. These
results suggested that microorganisms had been adapted
to high arsenic stress and maintained their diversity in TS
site after a long-term exposure to arsenic.
The aoxB genes were detected in all of the five arsenite oxidizers but not in the non-arsenite oxidizers. This indicates
that aoxB may be specific for most of the aerobic arseniteoxidizing bacteria and useful for detecting arsenite-oxidiz-

ing microorganisms in the environment. Inskeep et al.
[15] reported that arsenite oxidase genes are widely
present in different arsenite oxidizers and widespread in
soil-water systems. We have enriched pristine soils with
arsenite to isolate arsenite-oxidizing bacteria from noncontaminated soils but without success. To our knowledge, all of the cultured arsenite oxidizers obtained so far
were isolated from arsenic-contaminated sites. Inskeep et
al. [15] detected aoxB-like sequences from arsenic-contaminated environments but not from pristine soils indicating that arsenite oxidation is a major process in arseniccontaminated environments. The expression level of aoxB
could probably be applied to monitor environmental
arsenic-contaminated levels.
A phylogenetic analysis of the 5 arsenite oxidizers based
on the 16S rRNA genes and the aoxB genes showed a similar phylogeny indicating genomic stability of the aoxB
genes. The MICs of the arsenite oxidizers displayed a maximal arsenite resistance level in both Pseudomonas and
Agrobacterium. Furthermore, strains containing both the
arsenite oxidase and any type of transporter gene showed
a higher arsenite resistance level. These results suggest that
bacteria capable of both arsenite oxidation and arsenite
efflux mechanisms have an elevated arsenite resistance
level. We also found that arsenite can be fully oxidized
even at concentrations close to the MIC in arsenite oxidizers SY8 and TS44 (data not shown). Recently, we have
amplified and sequenced the arsC/ACR3 operon (arsC1arsR-arsC2-ACR3-arsH) in the adjacent downstream region
of aoxB in Pseudomonas. sp. TS44 (data not shown; GenBank, EU311944). Kashyap et al. [31] found that in Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 5A, disruption of aoxR caused
a loss in the ability to oxidize arsenite and furthermore
resulted in an apparent reducing phenotype probably due
to the action of cytosolic ArsC and subsequent pumping

out of As(III). It is noteworthy to point out that there are
two processes of As(V) reduction in the environment. One
is the use of As(V) as a terminal electron acceptor under
anaerobic conditions. The other is the intracellular reduction of As(V) to As(III) under aerobic conditions due to
the ArsC-dependent cytoplasmic arsenate reduction as
part of the arsenic resistance system (ars operon). Since
As(III) is the species being pumped out of cell (by arsB or
ACR3), the presence of As(III) in the environments can
also be detected under aerobic condition.
One of the main purposes in this research was to determine the correlation among the bacterial arsenite resistance level, bacterial distribution in the environment and
the different types of arsenite transporter gene families.
We found that the ACR3 genotypes were predominant
over arsB (33 ACR3 vs. 18 arsB) in our samples which was
in agreement with a report by Achour et al. [16]. In addition, we found any two types of arsenite transporter genes
can coexist in the same strain [arsB and ACR3(1), arsB and
ACR3(2), ACR3(1) and ACR3(2)]. Related reports also
found the presence of multiple sets of arsenic resistance
genes and operons in one strain, especially the arsenite
transporter genes. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 contains
two operon clusters (arsRBCH) for arsenic resistance [38].
Acidithiobacillus caldus has three sets of arsenic resistance
determinants, one located on the chromosome and the
other two exist on the transposon [39,40]. Corynebacterium glutamicum has two typical arsenic-resistant operons
and additional arsB and arsC genes, of which two arsenite
transporter genes belonged to the ACR3(1) group [41].
The genome of Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans revealed the
presence of four arsenic resistance operons including two
arsB genes and one ACR3 [42]. Multiple sets of arsenic
resistance determinants were also reported in B. subtilis
[18] and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20 [43]. These findings indicate that microorganisms have acquired multiple
resistance determinants via chromosomal duplication or
horizontal gene transfer to cope with arsenic toxicity. In
this study, ACR3(1) and ACR3(2) appeared to be mostly
associated with high arsenite resistance since they were
only identified from the high and intermediate arseniccontaminated sites, while arsB was found in all three sites.
One explanation is that ACR3 may have a higher affinity
and velocity to extrude arsenite than arsB and thus seems
to be more effective.
Heavy metal contaminated environments were shown to
provide a strong selective pressure for transfer of related
resistance genes within soil systems [44]. In this study,
aoxB and ACR3(1) appeared to be more stable than
ACR3(2) and arsB since phylogenetic discrepancies
between 16S rRNA genes and ACR3(2)/arsB were found
which supported HGT events of ACR3(2) and arsB. Most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/4

of the HGT occurred in strains identified from the highly
arsenic-contaminated TS soil [6 ACR3(2)]. This indicates
that arsenite transporter genes may be horizontally transferred and increasingly present in a microbial population
under conditions of long-term elevated arsenic stress. It is
important to note that HGT occurred in somewhat closely
related species in this study, however, this does not detract
from the suggestion of HGT and it is likely that the HGT
events occurred between these closely related species.
Martinez et al. [45] reported that PIB-Type ATPases (pbrA/
cadA/zntA) were broadly transferred in Arthrobacter and
Bacillus in radionuclide and metal contaminated soils.
Jackson and Dugas [46] also suggested that horizontally
transferred arsC resulted in the diversities and complexities of arsenate reductase during its evolution. Excluding
arsC, other genes related to arsenic resistance (e.g. arsA,
arsB/ACR3) had not been reported as being transferred by
HGT. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report
widespread horizontal transfer of arsenite transporter
genes. The HGT event and subsequent maintenance may
have occurred increasingly under the high arsenic pressure
[47] and resulted in plastic changes in microbial diversity.

Conclusion
This work investigates the distribution and diversity of
microbial arsenite-resistant species in soils representing
three different levels of arsenic contamination, and further studies the arsenite resistance and arsenic transforming genes of these species. Our research provides valuable
information of microbial species and genes responsible
for arsenite oxidation and resistance, and increases knowledge of the diversity and distribution of the indigenous
bacteria that may be stimulated for successful bioremediation of arsenic contamination.

Methods
Site description and soil sample collection
Four soil samples representing high (TS), intermediate
(SY) and low (LY/YC) levels of arsenic contamination
were used in this study. The TS soil was collected in Tieshan District, a highly arsenic-contaminated region,
which is located in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, central China. There are several kinds of metal (gold, copper,
iron) mines that have been smelted for many years. Concentrations of arsenic and heavy metals are extremely high
in water, soil and sediments of this area [36]. The SY soil
was collected from a pig farm, Shayang County, Jingmen
City, Hubei Province where there are certain levels of
arsenic in the soil due to the long-term usage of arsenic in
feed material to resist disease and stimulate pig growth.
The other two samples, LY and YC, were collected from
the low arsenic-contaminated soils near the Yellow Sea of
Lianyungang and Yancheng Cities Jiangsu Province, eastern China, respectively.

Several soil samples from each site were collected from the
surface horizon (0–15 cm), stored at 4°C and mixed
together for bacterial isolation. The total arsenic concentrations of the four soils (determined by atomic absorption spectrometry) were 337.2 mg kg-1 (183.4–882.2 mg
kg-1, SD = 184.58), 72.1 mg kg-1 (43.4–94.6 mg kg-1, SD =
18.31), 24.1 mg kg-1 (15.7–40.1, mg kg-1, SD = 8.24) and
34.6 mg kg-1 (22.0–48.8 mg kg-1, SD = 8.96) for TS, SY, LY
and YC, respectively.
Isolation and identification of arsenite-resistant and
arsenite-oxidizing bacteria
One hundred grams of each soil sample was amended
with NaAsO2 to a final concentration of 500 mg kg-1 and
incubated at 28°C for a week. During incubation sterilized H2O was added to the jars to reach the original moisture value. Isolation of arsenite-resistant bacteria was
performed by adding 10 g (triplicates) of each soil to 90
mL 0.85% NaCl in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and shaken
at 160 rpm for 30 min. 1 mL of the above mixture was
added to 9 mL 0.85% NaCl for serial dilution and plated
on chemically defined medium (CDM) plates [9] with a
final concentration of 800 μM NaAsO2 and incubated at
28°C for another week. Single colonies were picked and
restreaked several times to obtain pure isolates.

The obtained arsenite-resistant bacteria were tested for
their abilities to oxidize As(III) (NaAsO2) using a qualitative KMnO4 screening method [10]. Each arsenite-resistant bacterium was inoculated in CDM broth with a final
concentration of 800 μM NaAsO2 and then shaken at 160
rpm for 5 days at 28°C. For each isolate 1 mL culture was
added to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 30 μL of
0.01 M KMnO4 and the color change of KMnO4 was monitored. A pink color of the mixture indicated a positive
arsenite oxidation reaction [formation of As(V)]. The sterile CDM medium containing the same amount of NaAsO2
was used as an abiotic control. The arsenite oxidizing phenotype was also detected using the molybdene blue

method with a spectrophotometer (DU800, BeckMan,
CA, USA) [48].
Total DNA of each strain was extracted using standard
molecular genetic methods. Nearly full-length 16S rDNA
of the bacteria was amplified by PCR using universal
primers Uni-27F and Uni-1492R (Table 1) [49]. PCR
amplification was performed in an ATC 201 Thermal
Cycler (Apollo, San Diego, CA, USA) in a 50 μL volume
containing 10–50 ng DNA, 1 ng μL-1 of each primer, 200
μM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 μL dimethyl sulfoxide, 5 μL of 10 × PCR buffer [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3),
100 mM KCl] and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA), and adding ddH2O to a
final volume of 50 μL. The PCR program consisted of an
initial 5 min denaturation step at 94°C; 30 cycles of 1 min
at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, 1.5 min at 72°C; and a final
extension step at 72°C for 5 min.
Colony morphologies and 16S rDNA PCR-RFLP technique were used to remove the repeated isolates for each
sample. PCR-RFLP was performed by enzyme digestion at
37°C for 3 hrs in a 20 μL volume containing 2 μL of 10 ×
enzyme buffer, 2.5 units of HaeIII or MspI and 5–10 μL of
the 16S rDNA PCR products, amending ddH2O to a final
volume of 20 μL. The digested DNA fragments were separated in 2% agarose gels and the digestion patterns were
grouped by DNA fingerprinting profiles.
Identification of the aoxB gene encoding the arsenite
oxidase Mo-pterin subunit and arsB, ACR3(1) and
ACR3(2) genes encoding different arsenite transport
proteins
The PCR amplification of aoxB was performed using
degenerate primers (Primers #1F and #1R) (Table 1) and
following the PCR conditions as described by Inskeep et
al. [15]. The amplification of arsB, ACR3(1) and ACR3(2)
genes were performed using three pairs of degenerate
primers [darsB1F and darsB1R for arsB, dacr1F and dacr1R
for ACR3(1), dacr5F and dacr4R for ACR3(2)] (Table 1) as

to draft the manuscript. All authors read and approved the
final manuscript.

DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
The PCR products were purified using the UltraPure™ PCR
Kit (SBS Genetech). DNA sequencing analysis was performed using ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer by Sunbiotech
company (Beijing, China). All sequences were analyzed
by BlastN (for 16S rRNA gene) and BlastX (for deduced
AoxB and ArsB/Acr3p) searching tools [50]. All sequences
were checked manually and edited for the same lengths
using ClustalX 1.83 software [51]. MEGA 3.1 software
[52] was used to construct phylogenetic trees by the neighbor-joining distance method [53] and reliability of
inferred trees was tested with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Some reference sequences from the GenBank were used in
constructing phylogenetic trees for clarification.

Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) of arsenite
The MIC, defined as the lowest concentration of arsenite
that inhibited growth in CDM broth, was performed with
all arsenite-resistant bacteria. Triplicate samples of each
single colony were inoculated in 3 mL CDM broth supplemented with increasing concentrations of NaAsO2, incubated with shaking at 28°C for one week and the OD600
values were determined. The initial screening for MICs
was performed with 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM, and 20 mM
of NaAsO2. Subsequent determinations were performed
with 1 mM NaAsO2 intervals over the appropriate range.
The sensitivity of MIC detection was 1 mM.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The nucleotide sequences are posted in the NCBI GenBank database. Their accession numbers are: EU073067–
EU073124 for 16S rRNA genes, EF523515, EU311944–
EU311947 for aoxB, and EU311948–EU311999 for arsB/
ACR3.
