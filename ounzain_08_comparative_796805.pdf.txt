Abstract
Background: Myocyte stress 1 (MS1) is a striated muscle actin binding protein required for the
muscle specific activity of the evolutionary ancient myocardin related transcription factor (MRTF)/
serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional pathway. To date, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms that govern skeletal muscle specific expression of MS1. Such mechanisms are likely to
play a major role in modulating SRF activity and therefore muscle determination, differentiation and
regeneration. In this study we employed a comparative in silico analysis coupled with an
experimental promoter characterisation to delineate these mechanisms.
Results: Analysis of MS1 expression in differentiating C2C12 muscle cells demonstrated a
temporal differentiation dependent up-regulation in ms1 mRNA. An in silico comparative sequence
analysis identified two conserved putative myogenic regulatory domains within the proximal 1.5
kbp of 5' upstream sequence. Co-transfecting C2C12 myoblasts with ms1 promoter/luciferase
reporters and myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) over-expression plasmids revealed specific
sensitivity of the ms1 promoter to MyoD. Subsequent mutagenesis and EMSA analysis
demonstrated specific targeting of MyoD at two distinct E-Boxes (E1 and E2) within identified
evolutionary conserved regions (ECRs, α and β). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis
indicates that co-ordinated binding of MyoD at E-Boxes located within ECRs α and β correlates
with the temporal induction in ms1 mRNA.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that the tissue specific and differentiation dependent upregulation in ms1 mRNA is mediated by temporal binding of MyoD at distinct evolutionary
conserved E-Boxes within the ms1 5' upstream sequence. We believe, through its activation of ms1,
this is the first study to demonstrate a direct link between MyoD activity and SRF transcriptional
signalling, with clear implications for the understanding of muscle determination, differentiation and
regeneration.

Background
During mammalian embryogenesis, the development of
skeletal muscle is mediated by a co-ordinated series of
events that begins with commitment of mesodermal precursor cells to the skeletal muscle lineage, followed by
myoblast fusion and the subsequent progression of a programme of muscle specific gene expression [1-3]. A specialised group of transcription factors control this process
of myogenic specification and differentiation. These factors, designated the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs),
include four basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E-Box binding
proteins: MyoD, Myf5, Myogenin and MRF4 [4]. During
development MyoD and Myf5 dictate myoblast specification while Myogenin and MRF4 regulate terminal differentiation [5,6]. In collaboration with the MRFs, the
MADS-box myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) family of proteins contribute to the programme of muscle specific gene
expression [7,8].
Serum response factor (SRF), a MADS box transcription
factor related to the MEFs, also regulates skeletal muscle
gene expression through binding of a DNA sequence
known as the serum response element (SRE) or CArG box
[9-11]. In addition to binding and regulating numerous
muscle specific promoters [12,13], perturbation of SRF
activity severely impairs myoblast fusion and differentiation [14-16]. Confirming an important role for myogenic
SRF activity, a conditional skeletal muscle specific knockout of SRF results in severe skeletal muscle myopathy that
results in perinatal lethality [17].
SRF activity is dependent on its interaction with a range of
cell-type specific and signal responsive co-factors [18].
Myocardin, the founding member of a family of extraordinarily powerful myogenic SRF co-activators [19], has
been shown to be necessary and sufficient for cardiac and
smooth muscle specific gene expression [9,20,21]. Unlike
myocardin, the myocardin-related transcription factors
(MRTFs), MRTF-A (also known as MAL/MKL1/BASC) and
MRTF-B (MKL2), are expressed in skeletal muscle in addition to multiple other cell types [22-24].
A requisite role for the MRTFs in skeletal muscle development has been inferred from experiments in cultured
muscle cells, in which RNAi mediated knock-down of
MRTF-A repressed SRF-dependent gene expression resulting in impaired myoblast fusion and subsequent formation of multinucleated myotubes [25]. Transgenic mice
expressing a dominant-negative form of MRTF-A displayed a phenotype reminiscent of the skeletal muscle SRF
knock out mice supporting an important role for the
MRTFs in the control of muscle fiber growth and maturation [17]. In contrast to myocardin, which is constitutively
nuclear, the MRTFs shuttle between the cytoplasm and the
nucleus with nuclear accumulation required for SRF trans-

activation. Muscle specific mechanisms, which promote
MRTF nuclear accumulation, represent important regulatory pathways in the process of myogenic differentiation
via the MRTF/SRF signalling axis [9].
We, and others, have previously identified a novel striated
muscle specific actin binding protein, myocyte stress 1
(MS1, also known as STARS) [26,27] which has the ability
to synergistically activate SRF-dependent transcription
through a Rho-A dependent mechanism. Kuwahara and
colleagues subsequently demonstrated that STARS
(mouse homologue of MS1) activates SRF dependent
transcription by inducing the nuclear accumulation of
MRTF-A and -B through a Rho-A dependent mechanism
[28]. STARS perturbation via RNAi resulted in a significant
attenuation of muscle specific SRF activity suggesting that
endogenous STARS is an important component of the
muscle specific MRTF/SRF transcriptional pathway [28].
In support of this we have shown that ectopic MS1 expression results in an increased expression of characterised
MRTF/SRF target genes (Koekemoer AL and Chong NW,
unpublished) [29]. Interestingly, we have recently shown
that morpholino knockdown of zebrafish ms1 (zms1)
resulted in severe musculoskeletal deformities with curvature and shortening of the longitudinal axis [30]. This data
supports the previous studies and demonstrates that MS1
is a central component of the evolutionary ancient muscle
specific MRTF/SRF signalling axis.
Despite the important role of MS1 in skeletal muscle formation and function, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms governing its expression. The proximal 1.5
kbp 5'-flanking sequence has recently been shown to be
able to direct LacZ expression in adult cardiac and skeletal
muscle, with two MEF2 responsive motifs within the
proximal flanking sequence essential for the observed cardiac specificity [31]. However, the factors, motifs and regulatory mechanisms governing the skeletal muscle
specific expression profile remain unknown. Understanding such mechanisms will give us an exquisite insight into
how the MRTF/SRF signalling axis is regulated during
myogenesis in addition to expanding our knowledge of
the genetic circuits involved in mygenic differentiation.
In this study we investigated the transcriptional regulation
of the ms1 gene during myogenic differentiation using the
C2C12 myoblast cell line as an established model system.
We have shown that two myogenic E-Boxes, located
within evolutionary conserved regions in the ms1 promoter, play distinct roles in recruiting MyoD and subsequently activating the ms1 promoter during myogenic
differentiation.

Results
Ms1 transcript is differentially expressed during myogenic
differentiation
Ms1 expression is restricted to striated muscle with early
developmental expression during myogenesis in both vertebrate and invertebrate models [27,30]. In order to evaluate ms1 expression during myoblast differentiation in
vitro, cultured C2C12 cells, a myoblast cell line established from the leg muscle of the C3H mouse [32], were
used. C2C12 is a myoblast cell line, which remains proliferative in the presence of high concentrations of fetal
bovine serum. Upon serum depletion, these myoblasts
differentiate and fuse with each other into myotubes [33].
Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted using 1 µg of total
RNA obtained from subconfluent C2C12 myoblasts (MB)
and from C2C12 myotubes differentiated for 3 days (MT).
As shown in Figure 1A, there is a significant increase in
ms1 transcript in differentiated C2C12 cells compared to
confluent proliferating C2C12, suggesting a differentiation dependent up-regulation of ms1 mRNA.

The temporal expression profile of specific genes
expressed during myogenic differentiation can give us an
exquisite insight into both the function of the gene and
the regulatory processes governing its expression [34,35].
We have therefore measured the temporal expression profile of ms1 transcript during the controlled differentiation
of C2C12 myoblasts over a three-day period. RT-PCR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/50

using RNA isolated on consecutive days during differentiation shows that ms1 transcript is significantly induced
within the first day of the differentiation process with a
maintained increase in expression over the subsequent
three days (Figure 1B). Ms1 can thus be regarded as an
early wave myogenic transcript [36], with this temporal
profile having implications for its role and regulation during myogenic differentiation.
Analysis of the ms1 5' upstream DNA sequence
The transcriptional up-regulation of ms1 during myogenic
differentiation suggests its expression might be targeted by
differentiation promoting transcription factors. During
myogenesis, differentiation is under the control of E-Box
binding myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (MyoD, Myogenin, Myf4 and Myf5) and MADS domain Mef2 proteins
[37], with all myogenic genes containing binding motifs
for these transcription factors in their promoters and associated regulatory loci. We therefore, by means of comparative sequence analysis, proceeded to analyse the rat ms1
5' upstream sequence for enrichment of myogenic transcription factor binding motifs. Using the VISTA software
[38] we compared 5 kbp of 5' upstream sequence from rat,
with the orthologous locus in human. This compares
sequences that shared a common ancestor over 60 million
years ago and it has been shown empirically that conserved non-coding sequences, also known as evolutionary
conserved regions (ECRs), identified between these spe-

cies represent ideal candidates as functional transcription
factor binding motifs and regulatory domains [39].
Our in silico analysis (identifying sequences with 80%
conservation over a minimum of 100 bp window, Figure
2A) identified two ECRs, α and β (represented in red),
within the flanking 5 kbp of 5' upstream sequence. ECR a
encompassed the proximal 400 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and we propose represents the
proximal promoter. Within this proximal ECR a putative
TATA box (TATT) was found with optimal interspacing
from TSS [40], hence suggesting that this constitutes the
core promoter. Of particular interest, two E-Box sequences
(-253/-247 bp and -221/-215 bp) and a Mef2 motif (-135/

-125) were identified within this ECR. Further sequence
comparisons, aligning orthologous sequences obtained
from ENSEMBL, confirms full sequence conservation of
these identified myogenic motifs across multiple species
(Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Bos taurus, Homo sapiens,
Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta), supporting a conserved
functional role for these motifs (Figure 2B).
In addition to the proximal ECR, a fully conserved E-Box
was also identified in the distal ECR β, located 1.5 kbp
upstream of the TSS (Figure 2A). This ECR may represent
a skeletal muscle enhancer, with such enhancer's common upstream of other myogenic genes including desmin
and muscle creatine kinase [41,42]. In summary our com-

parative analysis suggests that the cis hardwiring required
for myogenic specific expression is contained within the 2
kbp 5'-upstream sequence with myogenic motifs identified in ECRs α and β.

were transiently transfected with a ms1 promoter reporter construct spanning from -1585 relative to transcription start site
and extending to nucleotide +60. Promoter fragment was cloned into the pGL3-Basic luciferase vector. Activity relative to
pGL3-B alone was determined in each cell line 48 hours later, at which point the cells were still subconfluent. The relative
activity of the promoter fragment (vs pGL3-B) in each cell line was then determined with relative activity in C2C12 assigned
arbitrary value of one (B) Vectors (+:0.3 µg, ++:0.6 µg) expressing Mef2D, myogenin and MyoD were co-transfected in combination with the ms1 prompter reporter construct (P-1585/+60) into C2C12 myoblasts as described in (A). Luciferase activity
in cells transfected with pcDNA and ms1 promoter reporter (P-1585/+60) was arbitrarily set at 1 fold activation. (C) Subconfluent H9c2 myoblasts were transiently transfected with the MRF over-expression vectors (+:0.5 µg, ++:1 µg). 48 hours post

to that of TBP. Statistically significant differences are indicated by *P < 0.05.

1585/+60 construct was analysed in vitro. The P-1585/+60
wild type promoter reporter (Figure 3A) is approximately
four times more active in the C2C12 myoblasts than in
the NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. This data suggests that
there is sufficient myogenic cis information encompassed
within the promoter reporter to drive cell-specific activity
in a myogenic cellular environment.
Myogenic factors can modulate the ms1 promoter
Since putative E-Box and Mef2 binding motifs are located
within ECR α and β, the sensitivity of these motifs to the
over-expression of their cognate binding proteins was
determined. The rat ms1 promoter (P-1585/+60) was
transfected into C2C12 myoblasts in the presence or
absence of the specific MRFs and Mef2D. In the presence
of MyoD, ms1 promoter activity was dose dependently
increased seven fold compared with control (empty
pcDNA3.1 vector). Myogenin alone or in combination
with Mef2D, shown to synergistically activate other myogenic promoters [43], did not significantly activate the
ms1 promoter (Figure 3B). Mef2D alone had no overall
activating effect on the ms1 promoter.

To determine whether these effects were observed at the
endogenous ms1 promoter, MRF and Mef2D proteins
were ectopically expressed in H9c2 cells, a rat myoblast
cell line which can enter the skeletal muscle differentiation programme and expresses an array of skeletal muscle
specific contractile and calcium handling proteins [44].
The expression level of endogenous ms1 mRNA in both
control (empty vector alone) and MRF transfected H9c2
cells was determined by quantitative real-time PCR.
MyoD over-expression (1.0 µg) significantly increased
ms1 mRNA levels by two fold (Figure 3C). Myogenin and
Mef2D alone, or in combination, had no effect on endogenous levels of ms1 transcript, suggesting MyoD is the primary myogenic activator of the endogenous ms1
promoter in a myoblast cellular context. These results suggest that MyoD can target the ms1 promoter to enhance its
activity, both in vitro and in vivo.
Site directed mutagenesis of the ms1 promoter
MyoD activates target promoters via heterodimerisation
with ubiquitous E2A proteins (E12, E47, E2-5, [45]),
which allows a stable DNA binding complex to bind the
E-Box sequence (consensus sequence, CANNTG). In order
to asses the contribution of the three conserved E-Boxes
(in ECR α and β) in mediating MyoD sensitivity, we executed site directed mutagenesis of their binding sites
within the ms1 promoter reporter construct (Table 1, Figure 4A).

Reporter constructs containing mutated sequences for the
three E-Boxes, singular and in combination (Figure 4A),
were co-transfected with the MyoD over-expression plas-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/50

mid into C2C12 myoblasts. Mutating E1 (P-1585/
+60∆E1) reduced promoter sensitivity to ectopic MyoD
expression by 50% (from 7- to 3.5-fold; Figure 4B), suggesting this E-Box (located in ECR β) is important for promoter sensitivity to MyoD. The additional mutation in E2
(P-1585/+60∆E1/∆E2) further attenuated promoter sensitivity to 2.5 fold (~67% decrease) (Figure 4B). The combined triple E-Box mutant (P-1585/+60∆E1/∆E2/∆E3)
did not result in a further decrease in promoter sensitivity
to MyoD compared to the double mutant (Figure 4B).
These results suggest that both E1 and E2, but not E3, are
required for MyoD activation of the rat ms1 promoter.
The putative TATA box (TATT) was also mutated exchanging the adenine, at second position for a guanine (TATT to
TGTT). This resulted in a dramatic 95% decrease in promoter activity (Figure 4C) in C2C12 myoblasts. Comparable loss of activity was observed in H9c2 myoblasts and
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown) suggesting loss of
activity is not cell type specific. This suggests that this
proximal TATT sequence represents a bona fide TATA box.
In vitro binding of MyoD at distal and proximal E-Box
sequences
The present mutagenesis analysis suggests that E1 and E2,
but not E3, play an important role in mediating MyoD
sensitivity to the rat ms1 promoter. To further elucidate
the biological importance of the E1 and E2 sequences, we
synthesised specific oligonucleotides (Table 1) containing
the E-Box elements present in ECR α and β, E1, E2 and E3.
These digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled double-stranded oligonucleotides were then incubated with a cold MyoD binding consensus E-Box sequence control in EMSA
experiments with whole cell extracts from C2C12 myoblasts. As shown in Figure 5, incubation of C2C12 whole
cell extracts with both MyoD consensus and E1, E2 and E3
sequences results in a specific DNA-Protein band shift.

The E1 and E2 shifted bands were successfully competed
with excess unlabelled MyoD consensus sequence, suggesting these probes were bound by MyoD protein. In
contrast, E3 could not be competed with unlabelled
excess of MyoD consensus suggesting other E-Box binding
proteins are shifting E3 in vitro. All three E-Box shifted
bands were competed with unlabelled excess of self, confirming shifted bands were specific to each sequence (data
not shown).
In agreement with our mutagenesis analysis, our EMSA
data suggests that MyoD can target E1 and E2, but not E3.
Other E-Box binding proteins expressed in C2C12 myoblasts are able to bind E3. Future experiments are aimed at
determining their identity.

Direct binding of MyoD to the endogenous ECRs within
the ms1 promoter
Our results suggest that the E1 and E2 sites are essential
for ms1 reporter gene function. We then utilised chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine whether
MyoD is physically recruited to the endogenous ECRs in
vivo, and determine the temporal dynamics of MyoD
recruitment during C2C12 differentiation.

An ECR-specific quantitative PCR (Figure 6A) was performed on formaldehyde-crosslinked, sheared chromatin
isolated during C2C12 differentiation, which was immunoprecipitated with MyoD and IgG specific antibodies. As
shown in Figure 6B, MyoD appears to be constitutively
bound at the E2 domain during differentiation, thus
MyoD binding precedes the induction of ms1 transcript
(Figure 1B). Interestingly MyoD is not bound to E1 until
day 1 (Fig. 6C), which coincides with transcriptional

induction of ms1 during the differentiation process. A
five-fold enrichment in relative binding of MyoD is
present at day 1 compared to day 0, with this level of
enrichment maintained at E1 during the subsequent three
days. These data suggest that MyoD targets both the E1
and E2 domains in vivo during C2C12 differentiation.
However, temporal binding at E1 coincides with differentiation dependent transcriptional induction. We speculate
that the ECR β represents a differentiation-dependent
skeletal muscle enhancer, with temporal binding required
for differentiation-dependent transcriptional induction of
the ms1 promoter.

Discussion
Understanding the mechanisms through which SRF activity is regulated during myogenesis is important if we want
to expand our knowledge of the gene regulatory pathways
and networks that drive skeletal muscle determination

An in silico comparative sequence analysis suggested that
the proximal 1.5 kbp 5'-upstream sequence would be
capable of driving muscle specific transcription. Within
this region, two evolutionary conserved regions were
identified, both of which were enriched with ultra conserved binding motifs for key myogenic regulatory factors.
The proximal ECR also contained a conserved TATA box
located at the correct distance from transcription start site
suggesting it constitutes the core promoter. This 1.5 kbp
promoter fragment was significantly more active in a muscle versus a non-muscle cell type (Figure 3A) supporting
the in silico derived hypothesis. It is of interest that in a
recent study the proximal 1.5 kbp 5'-upstream region of
the mouse STARS gene was able to direct transgenic lacZ
expression in adult skeletal muscle in vivo, thus supporting our in vitro data [31].

and differentiation. Targeting and activation of muscle
specific genes by SRF is dependent on specific association
with the powerful co-activators, MRFT-A and -B, and RhoA signalling. We, and others, have recently shown the
actin binding protein, MS1 (STARS), to be both required
and sufficient for muscle specific activation of the RhoA/
MRTF/SRF signalling axis. Therefore, understanding the
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing ms1
expression will give us a key insight into how the MRTF/
SRF axis is regulated during myogenic differentiation.
As a first step towards understanding the transcriptional
mechanisms governing ms1 expression in muscle differentiation, we analysed ms1 expression in differentiating
C2C12 cells. A robust induction in ms1 expression was
observed during the first day of differentiation suggesting
ms1 is an early 'wave' myogenic transcript [34]. Fernandez
and colleagues [48] have reported that C2.7 myoblast
fusion and differentiation is dependent on SRF, as a consequence of its role in regulating MyoD expression. In
addition, MyoD and SRF have been shown to physically
interact and syngerstically activate target promoters, with
consensus SREs enriched in bona fide MyoD target promoters [35]. Considering this, one would expect SRF
activity to coincide with MyoD during early myogenic differentiation. We propose this early expression of ms1
drives muscle specific activation of the MRTF/SRF axis,
coupling this pathway with MyoD expression and activity.

We speculated that the ultra conserved myogenic regulatory motifs encompassed within this promoter fragment
would be important for muscle specific activity. A significant increase in promoter reporter activity was observed
with the ectopic expression of the MRF, MyoD. However
myogenin and Mef2D were not able to activate the ms1
promoter reporter in this myoblast cellular environment.
This pattern of sensitivity was also the same at the level of
endogenous ms1 transcription.
The observed specific sensitivity to MyoD complements
the endogenous ms1 expression profile during C2C12 differentiation. MyoD is responsible for myogenic gene activation during early stages of differentiation [2,35], the
time at which ms1 transcription is induced. Myogenin and
Mef2 proteins are themselves subsequently induced by
MyoD, and in a combinatorial manner drive expression of
late myogenic genes as well as consolidating and maintaining expression of early myogenic genes [43,49]. In
addition this specific sensitivity may suggest that only
MyoD and not myogenin can target the myogenic E-Boxes
within the ms1 promoter in a myoblast cellular environment. This is not uncommon, for example, MyoD targets
myogenic E-Boxes within the chicken MLC-1 promoter,
which cannot be bound by myogenin [50].
It is of interest that Mef2C binding to the Mef2 consensus
sequence identified in our comparative analysis (ECR α)
has been shown to mediate basal and stress inducible cardiac specific promoter activity both in in vitro and in vivo
(Kuwahara et al, 2007). In addition, skeletal muscle specific deletion of the Mef2C isoform at early, but not late
times of embryogenesis, results in mice with disorganised
myofibers that are perinatal lethal (Potthoff et al, 2007).
Our data (Fig. 3) suggest that this Mef2 motif in the ms1
promoter is not required for the initial MyoD mediated
induciton of ms1. However, our data do not preclude the
possibility that Mef2D may contribute to ms1 expression

encompassing E1, E2 and E3. TSS position is also illustrated. Proteins were cross-linked to the DNA (in C2C12 cells during
myogenic differentiation) with formaldehyde, DNA was sheared by sonication, and Abs directed against IgG or MyoD were
added to precipitate any protein-DNA complexes. The precipitated complexes were pre-cleared with protein A beads. Samples analyzed included proliferating, subconfluent myoblasts (M), confluent myoblasts harvested prior to the induction of differentiation (D0), myoblasts subjected to differentiation conditions for 24 hours (D1), and differentiating myotubes at 48 hours
(D2) or 72 hours (D3) post-differentiation. Quantitative real time PCR were performed on isolated DNA using primers
encompassing the proximal (B) and distal (C) E-Box sequences (E2/E3 and E1 respectively). Amplification was quantified and
normalised to the input of each sample. The results are expressed as mean ± SE of at least three different ChIPs. Statistically
significant differences in fold enrichment are indicated by *P < 0.05. Representative PCR reactions were stopped in the linear
amplification range and run on agarose gel for visualisation.

later in myogenesis or that other isoforms of Mef2 may
contribute to ms1 activation.
We hypothesised that the observed MyoD sensitivity was
via specific targeting of MyoD to the ultra conserved EBox's, E1, E2 and E3, located within the two evolutionary
conserved regions. Indeed, via site directed mutagenesis
and electromobility shift assays, we demonstrated that E1
and E2, but not E3 appear to be targeted by MyoD. Surprisingly a significant level of MyoD sensitivity was
retained in the triple E-Box mutant. This may suggest the
presence of other non-conserved E-Boxes targeted by
MyoD within the promoter reporter or alternatively be a
result of the up-regulation of other myogenic transcription factors by MyoD, which subsequently target and activate the ms1 promoter at other motifs. It is of interest to
note the presence of a conserved SRE within the proximal
ECR, which can be bound by SRF in cardiomyocytes in
vivo (Ounzain S, unpublished). MyoD upregulation is
predicted to increase the activity of SRF [48], so it is possible for SRF to target and increase activity of ms1 promoter
independent of MyoD binding at E1 and E2. It is also
interesting to consider the up-regulation of the muscle
specific isoform of Mef2D (Mef2D1b), which we suspect
may target the ms1 promoter in late stages of differentiation.
Many muscle specific genes are activated at different times
during the myogenic differentiation process. Numerous
studies suggest that this differential expression of each target gene is a product of specific temporal binding of
MyoD at distinct E-Boxes within the cis regulatory
domains of the gene, which itself is coupled to chromatain modification and remodelling [3]. We therefore
used ChIP to measure in vivo binding of MyoD at the ms1
E1 and E2 domains during C2C12 differentiation. Our
analysis shows that MyoD is constitutively bound at the
proximal E2 domain during differentiation, with binding
preceding the induction of ms1 transcript at day 1 (Figure
6B). MyoD is capable of binding target sequences prior to
gene activation, acting in a repressive manner via the specific recruitment of repressive chromatin remodelling
complexes. Interestingly, ms1 transcriptional induction at
day 1 (Figure 1B) coincides with MyoD binding at E1,
located within the ECRβ (Figure 6C). This suggests MyoD
targeting at E1 is required for transcriptional activation of
ms1 and we therefore propose that ECRβ could represent
a differentiation-dependent skeletal muscle enhancer.
Prior to activating transcription, MyoD associated with
HDACs serves to mark myogenic genes for subsequent differentiation cues and thus activation [51]. It is conceivable
that MyoD binding at the ms1 promoter prior to differentiation primes the promoter in a 'poised' myogenic state.
The recruitment of HDACs by MyoD causes the local chro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/50

matin environment to be compacted and will prevent the
association of MyoD and other activating factors with specific cognate binding sites. However appropriate differentiation signals can stimulate MyoD to toggle between
HDAC and HAT recruitment in addition to association
with differentiation-specific myogenic factors [3]. This
facilitates binding of MyoD with other E-Boxes (E1) and
allows the formation of activating transcriptional complexes.
MyoD acetylation has recently been implicated as a central mediator of the temporal activation of muscle specific
gene expression during myogenesis [47]. We therefore
cannot rule out the possibility that during C2C12 differentiation an acetylated MyoD form with increased DNA
binding efficiency [52] is capable of binding the E1
domain, resulting in the temporal activation of ms1 transcription. It is of interest that preliminary data indicate
that trichostatin A, a HDAC inhibitor, is able to increase
ms1 transcript abundance in H9c2 myoblasts (Ounzain S,
unpublished).
Taking the present data together, we propose a model
whereby MyoD binding at the ms1 proximal ECR in
myoblasts represses ms1 transcription via the recruitment
of HDACs. This proximal binding is essentially priming
the ms1 promoter, placing it in a poised state for sensing
appropriate differentiation cues. Upon differentiation
MyoD associates with HATs and SWI/SNF, which subsequently causes remodelling of the local chromatin environment, allowing MyoD to bind E1 within the distal ECR
or alternatively, temporally acetylated MyoD binds the E1
domain. Further targeting of HATs and specifically SWI/
SNF complexes (at E1) can facilitate binding of TBP and
other factors involved in polymerase II pre-initiation complex formation and promote transcriptional elongation
[53-58]. We thus speculate that temporal targeting of
MyoD at E1 is required to establish the optimum environment for Pol II action and robust transcription.
In summary our data suggests that MS1 is a key component of a MyoD generated feed-forward regulatory circuit,
where factors induced by MyoD (like ms1) feed-forward to
regulate late MyoD activity (via SRF) at subsequent target
genes, therefore acting to temporally pattern the timing of
gene expression during skeletal myogenesis. This MyoDMS1-SRF feed-forward network would serve to consolidate and amplify the myogenic cascade. Indeed SRF itself
acts in combination with MyoD to activate many downstream genes, thus, through the specific regulation of ms1,
MyoD is able to synchronize SRF activity with its own and
thus collaborate to mediate the temporal activation of
downstream genes.

We believe this is the first study to demonstrate a direct
link between MyoD activity and SRF transcriptional signalling, with ms1 serving as the nodal point to integrate
these two central myogenic regulatory networks. It is of
interest that in cardiomyocytes MS1 serves a similar function in that it integrates the Mef2 and SRF signalling networks, providing a link for crosstalk between them [31].
This is thus a conserved emerging paradigm for MS1 function both in cardiac and skeletal muscle. In addition we
have data to suggest that MS1 is capable of integrating the
GATA4 cardiogenic network with SRF activity [59].
This study also has implications for myogenic disease
phenoptypes. IGF-1 and IL-4, both central mediators of
post-natal skeletal muscle regeneration are regulated by
SRF in response to stress [60]. Therefore understanding
the molecular mechanisms regulating ms1 expression may
allow us to identify and develop therapeutic strategies for
the up-regulation of ms1 gene expression in a disease phenotype, which would facilitate regeneration via stimulation of SRF activity and resulting up-regulation of IL-4 and
IGF-1.

Conclusion
Identification of direct transcriptional targets of MyoD
and de-convolution of the transcriptional regulatory networks that operate in muscle cells represent an essential
target if we are to understand not only how muscle differentiates but also how it responds to stress and damage,
therefore allowing regeneration. We have demonstrated
that via temporal binding of MyoD at distinct E-Boxes
within the ms1 promoter, ms1 potentially serves to integrate the MyoD and SRF myogenic regulatory circuits,
thus driving a feed-forward auto-regulatory circuit that
consolidates and amplifies the myogenic phenotype. We
believe this is the first study to describe a direct link
between MyoD activity and SRF signalling, with ms1
allowing cross talk to occur between these two independent myogenic networks. This implicates MS1 as a key factor involved in myogenic differentiation and potentially
regeneration.

serum) at confluence for up to 4 days with medium
change every 2 days.
Plasmid constructs
The rat MS1 gene sequence was obtained from GenBank
(NC_005106) and was used to design primers that would
amplify the 5' flanking region. Two oligonucleotides, P1585-SacI and P+60-HindIII (Table 1), were designed to
amplify a portion of DNA sequence starting -1585 bp
upstream of the transcription start site (+1), with primers
tailed with restriction sites for SacI and HindIII restriction
enzymes respectfully. In addition to template (rat
genomic DNA, WKY strain) and primers P-1585-SacI and
P+60-HindIII, the reaction contained 0.2 mM dNTPs,
Expand polymerase buffer and 5 units of Taq Expand high
fidelity polymerase (Roche). Reaction was subjected to 35
cycles of amplification (45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 59°C and 90
s at 72°C). The PCR product was cloned into the vector
pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced to ensure fidelity
of amplification. The verified plasmid was then cut with
SacI/HindIII and the released -1585 promoter fragment
was purified and cloned into the pGL3-Basic (Promega)
reporter vector, SacI/HindIII digested. The subsequent
construct was designated P-1585/+60WT. The MyoD and
Myogenin expression plasmids were provided by Dr
Andrew Lassar [62,63] and the Mef2D expression plasmid
was a gift from Dr Eric Olson (University of Texas, South
Western Medical centre) [64].
Site directed mutagenesis
The P-1585/+60WT construct was subjected to site
directed mutagenesis to mutate the TATA, E-Box1, 2 and 3
binding sites, using the Quik Change II site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers used
to generate the TATA and E-Box mutations are reported in
Table 1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturers instructions. Mutated fragments
were then re-cloned into the Sac I/Hind III sites of the corresponding pGL3-Basic vectors. Double (∆E1/∆E2) and
triple-site (∆E1/∆E2/∆E3) mutation constructs, were generated by consecutive rounds of mutagenesis. The resulting plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Methods
Cell cultures
The H9c2 rat myoblast and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell
lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2 at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
2 mM glutamine, streptomycin and penicillin (each at 10
g/liter). C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin and maintained at
37°C in 5% CO2. The differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts
into myotubes was achieved by the addition of differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse

Transient transfections and luciferase assays
C2C12 and NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using the cationic transfection reagent, Jet Pei (QBiogene), according to
the manufacturers protocol. Cells were seeded in six well
plates. Twenty-four h post plating; the cells were co-transfected with 0.5 µg of promoter-luciferase construct and
equimolar amounts for the other plasmids used (total of
0.6 µg). The total amount of DNA was kept constant using
empty vector (pcDNA3.1). To normalise for transfection
efficiency, the pRL-TK (Promega) expression plasmid containing Renilla luciferase (20 ng per well) was co-transfected. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were

measured at 48 h post-transfection using the Dual-Glo™
Luciferase assay system (Promega) and a Lumat LB9507
luminometer (Berthold Technologies). All plasmids were
purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen) and at least two
preparations per plasmid were tested. The transfection
efficiency was normalised using the Renilla luciferase
activity levels and each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated in a minimum of three independent
experiments.
RNA isolation and quantitative real time RT-PCR
H9c2 cells seeded in six well plates were transfected with
up to 1.5 µg of expression plasmid using JetPei (as above).
Total amount of DNA was kept constant using empty vector (pcDNA3.1). Forty-eight h post transfection or 24 h
with TSA, total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. RNA (1 µg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA
using oligo (dT) and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen). Rat ms1 mRNA expression was analysed
using quantitative PCR with fluorescent-labelled TaqMan
probes (Rat ms1 primers and probe, Cat No.
Rn00598518_m1, Applied Biosystems). TBP was used as
the internal control (Cat No. Mm00446973_m1, Applied
Biosystems). PCR amplifications were performed in
duplicate in 25 µl containing 2 µl cDNA template in 2×
PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Amplification conditions as follows: 50°C, 2 min; 95°C, 10 min; 40 cycles
of 95°C for 15 s followed by 60°C for 1 min. Reactions
were performed and products detected using an ABI-Prism
HT 7900 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). The
level of expression of ms1 mRNA was normalised to TBP
expression. For C2C12 myoblasts, cells were cultured and
harvested for RNA extraction according to the time course
of differentiation. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Total RNA (2 µg) was reverse transcribed with
Superscript III (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed with Qiagen HotStart Taq Master Mix and SYBR
Green I as described previously (Schmittgen and Zakrajsek, 2000) using primers for ms1 and EF1-α (Table 1).
Amplifications were performed in a DNA Engine Opticon
System (MJ Research) and quantified. Ms1 mRNA levels
were normalised to EF1-α mRNA levels.
Electromobility shift assays (EMSA)
Whole cell extracts were prepared from cultured C2C12
myoblasts using the CelLytic™-M cell lysis extraction reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturers instructions.
The protein concentrations were determined using the
Bradford assay (Bio Rad). Whole cell extracts were incubated for 15 min with 0.5 pmol of the appropriate digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled double-stranded oligonucleotide
probe (Table 1) in a 20 µl reaction containing binding
buffer (Roche), 1 µg poly (dI-dC) (Roche) and 0.1 µg poly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/50

L-lysine (Roche). The probes were end-labelled with DIG11-ddUTP (Roche). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 µl loading dye (Roche). For competition experiments, a 200-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded
oligonucleotide (Table 1) was added to the reaction. The
samples were then run on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel using 1× TGE buffer (50 mM Tris, 380 mM Glycine and 2 mM EDTA), and transferred to a positively
charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). DIGlabelled oligonucleotides were visualised by incubation
with alkaline phosphatase-labelled F(ab)2 anti-DIG Ab,
followed by chemiluminescence reaction with 100 µg/ml
CPSD substrate (Roche).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)
C2C12 ChIPs were performed using MyoD (de la Serna et
al 2005) and IgG (Santa Cruz) antibodies. The ChIP was
performed as described previously [57], except that
immune complexes were eluted with 0.1 M NaHCO3 and
1% SDS, and following reversal of cross-links, the eluate
was digested by proteinase K digestion and purified using
the Qiagen PCR Purification kit (28106). 4 µl of DNA
eluted from the column was used for PCR. Inputs consisted of 1% chromatin before immunoprecipitation.
PCRs were performed with Qiagen HotStart Taq Master
Mix using primer sets reported in Table 1. Amplification
was quantified by a DNA Engine Opticon System (MJ
Research), then normalised to the input of each sample.
PCR reactions run on agarose gels were stopped in the linear range and visualised using SYBR Green I.
Comparative DNA analysis
Comparative sequence analysis of human and rat was performed using web-based software available at the Lawrence Berkley Laboratory genome website (VISTA).
Orthologous sequences from Mus musculus, Bos taurus,
Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes and Macaca mulatta were
obtained from the ENSEMBL genome data base and
aligned using CLUSTAL W.
