Abstract
Background: The Intergenic Breakage Model, which is the current model of structural genome
evolution, considers that evolutionary rearrangement breakages happen with a uniform propensity
along the genome but are selected against in genes, their regulatory regions and in-between.
However, a growing body of evidence shows that there exists regions along mammalian genomes
that present a high susceptibility to breakage. We reconsidered this question taking advantage of a
recently published methodology for the precise detection of rearrangement breakpoints based on
pairwise genome comparisons.
Results: We applied this methodology between the genome of human and those of five sequenced
eutherian mammals which allowed us to delineate evolutionary breakpoint regions along the human
genome with a finer resolution (median size 26.6 kb) than obtained before. We investigated the
distribution of these breakpoints with respect to genome organisation into domains of different
activity. In agreement with the Intergenic Breakage Model, we observed that breakpoints are
under-represented in genes. Surprisingly however, the density of breakpoints in small intergenes (1
per Mb) appears significantly higher than in gene deserts (0.1 per Mb).
More generally, we found a heterogeneous distribution of breakpoints that follows the organisation
of the genome into isochores (breakpoints are more frequent in GC-rich regions). We then discuss
the hypothesis that regions with an enhanced susceptibility to breakage correspond to regions of
high transcriptional activity and replication initiation.
Conclusion: We propose a model to describe the heterogeneous distribution of evolutionary
breakpoints along human chromosomes that combines natural selection and a mutational bias
linked to local open chromatin state.

Background
An important aspect of chromosome evolution is concerned with the maintenance of syntenies and with
changes in the order of DNA fragments. Rearrangements
that shuffle a chromosome organisation happen because
of double-strand breaks and of the joining of doublestranded DNA ends, resulting in new conformations of
the molecules. If the molecular bases of DNA damage and
repair mechanisms that control these genetic instabilities
at the cellular level are well described [1,2], the biophysical forces and selection constraints at work on an evolutionary timescale still need to be fully understood. For
example, it remains mostly unexplained why the rate of
chromosomal changes, estimated by the analysis of comparative maps between chicken and a number of mammals, is extremely variable (more than one order of
magnitude of variation) both along evolutionary time
and across different lineages [3,4]. In fact, despite recent
progress made in this field of research, it remains an open
question simply to design a model that would account for
the observed positions of rearrangement breakpoints [5].
In 1984, Nadeau and Taylor [6] analysed the locations of
83 homologous loci between the human and mouse autosomes and observed that the length distribution of 13
conserved segments between these two genomes fits the
distribution of a Poisson process, that is, rearrangement
breakpoints are independently and uniformly distributed.
This is referred to as the Random Breakage Model (RBM).
Since then, the resolution of comparative maps has regularly improved. The number of delineated conserved segments between these two species increased by more than
an order of magnitude [7-9]. This demonstrated the
robustness of the main Nadeau and Taylor argument
[10,11], at least for the large conserved chromosomal segments. The improved resolution also allowed to observe
that the number of small conserved segments appears to
be larger than predicted by the RBM [8,12-14], suggesting
that the latter is not valid at a small scale (d 1 Mb). By
comparing the number and size of breakpoints to the
minimum number of rearrangements that can explain the
structural differences between two genomes (each rearrangement event likely breaking the genome twice),
Pevzner and Tesler [11] estimated that breakpoint regions
are intensively reused in mammalian history. The validity
of this argument has been criticised [15-18], further
defended [19,20], and remains uncertain. Nevertheless,
multi-species comparative maps pointed to the fact that,
during bird and mammal evolution, breakpoints appear
to have occurred in the same region over independent lineages more often than expected under the RBM [21-24].
Those breakpoint hotspots would then correspond to evolutionarily-stable fragile regions. The correlation between
the localisations of breakpoints in these lineages and the
distribution of several other genomic features such as segmental duplications [25,26], various repeated elements

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/335

[27], experimental fragile sites [28,29], high GC content
and CpG island density [24] provided further evidence
suggesting that the distribution of breakpoint regions
should be analysed in the context of a genome organisation. In this regard, Peng et al. [19] and Becker & Lenhard
[5] proposed the Intergenic Breakage Model (IBM), where
rearrangement breakages happen uniformly at random on
the genome but are deleterious in genes, their regulatory
regions, and in-between. The argument for the IBM is the
simple fact that rearrangements that would break functional regions of the genome are selected against, which
has since received some support from a functional analysis of vertebrate genomes [30]. If there seems to be strong
evidence for the existence of some particular breakage
hotspots, it remains unclear to which extent the model of
evolution may deviate from the RBM, and what the alternative model would be.
Taking advantage of recent progress in the detection of
rearrangement breakpoints in mammalian chromosomes
that allowed us to locate them with a finer precision than
obtained before [31], we propose some advances on the
analysis of their distribution along the human genome
relatively to the positions of genes and to the isochore
organisation. Our results provide a direct comparison of
the observed heterogeneous distribution of breakpoint
regions with the predictions of the Intergenic Breakage
Model, and bring new insight into the relationship
between mammalian genome evolution and genome
organisation. We further discuss these findings in terms of
chromatin accessibility and elaborate on the necessity to
take into account a mutational bias towards regions of
replication initiation and of high transcriptional activity
when deriving breakage models.

Results
Delineating mammalian evolutionary Breakpoint Regions
A Breakpoint Region (BPR) on the human genome is
defined as a region that underwent at least one large chromosomal structural change, or is orthologous to such a
region in a non-human lineage. We applied the method
described in [31] to do pairwise comparisons between the
genome of human and those of five other mammals
(chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, and dog). We thus
obtained the positions on the human genome of all
breakpoints differentiating the genome organisation of
human from the genome organisation of each of the other
five species. Mapping the whole set of BPRs from all lineages on the human genome, each group of intersecting
BPRs was replaced by the intersection of all BPRs in the
group when they could be explained by a unique rearrangement event, and by the union of all BPRs otherwise
(see Methods). This procedure resulted in a data set of 622
non-intersecting BPRs with sizes spanning a wide range
from 1 nucleotide (there is no ambiguity on the breakpoint location) to 2 887 673 nucleotides. The BPR size
Page 2 of 12

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:335

distribution is strongly skewed toward small values (Fig.
1): the BPR median size is 26.6 kb while 78% (483/622)
of the BPRs have a length smaller than 100 kb. The BPRs
are not uniformly distributed along the human chromosomes (Fig. S1 in Additional File 1) and this resolution
allows us to compare their localisation with small scale
genomic features such as genes.
Several rearrangements that break the DNA molecule at
close loci may result in a single BPR because we may be
missing some homologous markers between the breakpoints, or because intersecting BPRs from several lineages
were grouped into one. In particular, large BPRs are more
likely to contain several independent breakage events. To
control for this effect in our analysis, every estimation of
breakpoint density (see Methods) was performed with
two modellings of the number of breakpoints within each
BPR:
• Model M1: All BPRs contain exactly one breakpoint.
• Model M2: A BPR of length L (kb) contains a number of
breakpoints n = max(1, L/100) i.e. when L ≤ 100 kb, a BPR
contains one breakpoint, while for L > 100 kb, BPRs are
regions with 1 breakpoint per 100 kb.
Model M2 supposes that more than one breakpoint have
aggregated (possibly in different lineages) inside large

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/335

BPRs. The aggregation density parameter is not supposed
to model the real number of breakages, but is meant to
provide a control that the results are not biased due to an
under-estimation of the number of breakage events in
large BPRs. This choice of one breakage every 100 kb
along large BPRs should be ample enough to test for this
possible bias since it is one order of magnitude larger than
the largest breakpoint density (1 per Mb) observed in this
work using model M1 and 50-fold larger than the average
breakpoint density over the complete genome (Table 1).
As all our conclusions turn out to be valid for the two
models, hence demonstrating that they are not subject to
the biases mentioned above, all figures with breakpoint
density estimates are presented for model M1 while the
corresponding figures using model M2 are systematically
provided as supplementary material in Additional file 1.
Unless otherwise indicated, model M1 will therefore be
implicitely assumed from now on.
Remark: We mapped the positions of BPRs on the human
genome while they do not necessarily concern evolutionary events that happened in the human lineage. In fact,
the majority of them actually account for rearrangements
in the rodent genomes (318/622, or 51%). For these
events, a BPR on the human genome means that the
rodent genome presents a breakage at the orthologous
position. It therefore gives evidence for a susceptibility to
breakage in the human region, that we may confront with
evolutionarily stable genomic features such as isochores.
BPRs are preferentially intergenic
Rearrangements are expected to be selected against if they
break genes. It is the first basic assumption of the Intergenic Breakage Model [5,19]. Therefore BPRs are likewise
expected to lie preferentially outside genes. To test
whether genic content is avoided by BPRs, we compared
the breakpoint density (see Methods) along genic and
intergenic regions and averaged over the whole human
genome (Table 1). The results correspond to the expectations: for the two modellings of the BPR data set, we
observed that the intergenic (resp. genic) density is larger
(resp. smaller) than the average genome density, with a
twofold difference between intergenic and genic densities.
We performed the same analysis for 1000 simulated BPR
data sets with randomised positions. None of these simuTable 1: BPRs are preferentially intergenic.

lations reproduced density differences as large as the
observed, thus confirming that they are significantly larger
than expected by a Random Breakage Model (P <0.001).
These results agree with an intergenic breakpoint model,
where breakpoints occur at random but are selected
against in genic regions of a genome.
At first glance, the difference between intergenic and genic
breakpoint densities suggests a rather weak effect of natural selection against breakage inside genes. However,
when a BPR intersects a gene, that does not necessarily
mean that the gene has been broken and become non
functional. In fact, the major part of the genic breakpoint
density is accounted by BPRs that overlap both genic and
intergenic regions so that the breakpoints may have
occurred outside the genes. Indeed, among the 265 BPRs
that overlap a gene, only 57 are fully genic. The genic density can therefore simply be an effect of the lack of precision of our BPRs. The apparent breakage inside 57 genes
may have different explanations, from bad annotation of
the gene borders to the possible duplication of a broken
region, that may or not have a relation to the rearrangement itself, leaving at least one functional copy of the concerned gene. For example, the human gene FAIM
(Ensembl identifier ENSG00000158234) contains a BPR
due to a rearrangement in the mouse lineage. A duplication in the mouse genome, probably linked to the rearrangement, yielded two annotated functional orthologs of
the "broken" gene located on both sides of the rearranged
region in the mouse genome (Ensembl identifiers
ENSMUSG00000032463 and ENSMUSG00000079413).
Hence, our genic breakpoint density is likely providing a
somewhat misleading underestimation of the strength of
natural selection. An accurate estimation of natural selection against breakages in genes would require an individual investigation of the evolutionary history of each gene/
BPR pair, which is beyond the scope of the present study
on the overall breakpoint distribution relatively to largescale features of genomic organisation.
Rearrangement breakpoints are over-represented in small
intergenes
Under a random model, or an intergenic model where
genic regions are avoided, we expect the breakpoint density to be independent of the size of the intergenic regions.
Moreover, selection may not only discard the breakage in
genes, but also between genes and their regulatory
regions, as hypothesised by Peng et al. [19], or in gene regulatory blocks, as hypothesised by Becker & Lenhard [5].
Under this "Intergenic Breakpoint Model", we thus expect
the breakpoint density to grow with the size of the intergenic regions, since breakage in small intergenes, which
necessarily lie close to a gene, should be avoided for their
possible importance in gene regulation. Surprisingly, we
observed that intergenic density actually negatively corre-

lates with intergenic size (Fig. 2), the breakpoint density
decreasing by more than one order of magnitude from 1
breakpoint per Mb in small intergenes (L < 20 kb) to 0.07
Mb-1 for the largest intergenes (L > 300 kb). In comparison, we performed the same analysis for 1000 simulated
BPR data sets with randomised positions and, as expected
under an RBM, we did not observe any dependency of the
intergenic breakpoint density with the intergenic size for
these control data sets (Fig. 2). When using model M2 of
the BPR data set, these results remained unchanged:
breakpoint density is significantly higher in small intergenes than in large ones (~ tenfold; see Fig. S2 in Additional File 1).
In mammalian genomes, it is known that the gene distribution is highly heterogeneous and is linked to the organisation of the genome into isochores. Thus, small
intergenes are concentrated inside regions of high GC-

content, also referred to as heavy isochores [32-34]. Correspondingly, we found a higher breakpoint density in
GC-rich regions of the genome (0.6 Mb-1) than in GCpoor regions (0.1 Mb-1) (Fig. 3; Fig. S3 in Additional File
1). These results suggest a model of evolution where the
breakage probability depends on the genomic organisation. GC-rich regions, which exhibit small intergenes,
seem to have a higher breakage probability along evolutionary time. In this study, isochores are observed in the
human genome, whereas the breakages may have
occurred in any mammalian lineage. However, isochores
of mammalian genomes at this evolutionary scale are conserved [35-38]. This allows us to relate the breakage to an
ancestral configuration of the genome, and thus to suppose that the breakage and the genomic organisation are
contemporary.

domised ones. For each class, we found that intergenes
containing observed BPRs were two to three times smaller
than intergenes corresponding to the randomised data set.
These size differences are significant except for the class of
highest GC content (> 53%) due to its small size (Table
2). We then performed the reciprocal test to control for
the effect of intergene size when correlating the BPR density with GC content. We did not find any significant difference in the median GC-content between BPRs and the
simulated data set when considering classes of intergene
size (see Table 1 in Additional File 1). It thus appears that
the correlation between intergene size and BPR density
cannot be fully explained by their respective correlation to
the GC content, so that intergenic size comes out to be the
appropriate parameter to describe susceptibility to breakage.

Since intergene size correlates with GC content, it may be
difficult to ascertain which of these two parameters best
describes the positions of the BPRs. In order to disentangle the two, we analysed one while fixing the other. First,
for five classes of GC content, we compared the median
sizes of intergenes containing observed BPRs and ran-

Discussion
We used a comparative genomics method based on the
approach proposed by Lemaitre et al. [31], that allowed us
to delineate a data set of 622 small regions of the human
genome, the BPRs, that were modified by large structural
mutations in one of the analysed mammalian genomes.
On the one hand, we were able to quantitatively verify the
hypothesis that rearrangements are selected against if they
break genes (Table 1), thanks to the high resolution of the
BPR data set (Fig. 1). On the other hand, contrary to what
is expected under the Intergenic Breakage Model [5,19],
the negative selection of rearrangements that break functional regions does not explain the observed heterogeneity of the BPR distribution. We showed that there is a
significant preferential localisation of BPRs in small intergenes (Fig. 2). Correspondingly, BPR enrichment is also

observed within GC-rich regions (heavy isochores) (Fig.
3), which are known to be gene dense and to be correlated
with many other genomic features [32-34,39].
Our results are consistent with some previous observations in studies made at a lower resolution [22,40]. Also,
in more specific studies, these observations were made by
looking at restricted parts of some genomes, for example
when human/chicken evolutionary breakpoints were
compared [24] between two chicken chromosomes (11
and 28), when human-dog orthologs were studied in high
GC regions [41], or a whole set of human/gibbon or
human/cattle breakpoints [42,43]. In the latter case, the
presence of many translocation breakpoints in gene rich
regions was interpreted as positive selection acting on
those genes. In the present work, we observed that GC
content does not fully explain the decrease of breakpoint
density with increasing intergene size. We propose that
the heterogeneous distribution of breakpoints may be
explained by the open state of the chromatin at the BPR
positions. The regions of open chromatin are thought to
be those of high transcriptional activity, early replication,
accessibility to DNAse, and subject to DNA hypomethylation.
Transcription
Our results suggest that evolutionary rearrangements tend
to happen in regions of high transcriptional activity (in
small intergenes, close to genes). Indeed, heavy isochores
are regions of high gene density and thus of high transcriptional activity. In these regions, the DNA molecule
has to be accessible to the proteins involved in transcription and the chromatin fiber is thought to be in a
decondensed state (open chromatin) [44,45]. Because of
this accessibility, such regions may also exhibit higher fragility to DNA double strand breaks, and in consequence to
chromosomal rearrangements.
Replication
Regions of replication initiation are also likely to require
an open chromatin state (an accessible DNA). Recently,
Huvet et al. [46] discovered human genomic regions,
called N-domains (see Methods), whose strand compositional asymmetry profiles are N-shaped as a footprint of
the replication activity in the germline, and flanked by
two putative replication origins (ORIs). They noted that
these ORIs are at the heart of a remarkable gene organisation. Genes tend to lie close to the borders of N-domains,
with a preferential co-orientation with the replication fork
progression. Furthermore, broadly expressed genes are
over-represented in the regions of the genome close to
ORIs [46] and an analysis of high resolution replication
timing data in relation to N-domains revealed that ORIs
are likely to be early replicating and active in most tissues
[47]. This led us to analyse the BPR locations with respect
to the human ORIs. Within the 28.5% of the genome cov-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/335

ered by N-domains, we observed a preference of BPRs to
lie close to the putative replication origins (Fig. 4(a)) consistent with the observation of some increase of small
intergene coverage (Fig. 4(b)). The intergenic breakpoint
density decreases from 0.4 Mb-1 close to the ORIs to less
than 0.1 Mb-1 in the middle of the N-domains. Moreover,
intergenic breakpoint density close to the ORIs is larger
than expected assuming that intergene size is the only factor governing the intergenic breakpoint density (0.2 Mb-1)
(Fig. 4(a)) pointing to a specific effect due to the proximity to the ORIs. These observations suggest that evolutionary rearrangements tend to happen in regions of
replication initiation.
DNA hypomethylation
There are little available experimental data on the accessibility of genomic regions, especially in germline cells.
Cytosine DNA methylation has been described as a mediator of gene silencing in repressed heterochromatin
regions, while potentially active open chromatin regions
would be essentially unmethylated [48,49]. Highthroughput experiments are only starting to unravel
genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, in particular in
the complex genomes of vertebrates [50]. However, there
is a genomic marker that is often used to estimate DNA
methylation in the germline directly from the genomic
sequence even though it was shown to present some
dependency on the GC context [51]. It is based on the fact
that CpG dinucleotides are highly mutable in the human
genome in presence of methylation and it consists in computing the CpG observed/expected ratio (CpG o/e)
[52,53]. To test the hypothesis that open chromatin is a
determinant of the localisation of BPRs, we analysed the
BPR density compared to the CpG o/e computed after
removing known CpG islands from the analysis (CpG
islands are known to localise often in the promoter
regions of highly and widely expressed genes). A clear
increase of the breakpoint density was observed, from 0.1
Mb-1 in regions of lowest CpG o/e (high methylation
level) to 0.9 Mb-1 in regions with the largest CpG o/e (low
methylation level) (Fig. 5(a)). Hence, high breakpoint
density is found to be associated with the less methylated
regions of the genome, likely to be the most accessible.
DNAse sensitivity
Recently, experimental high resolution DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites were made available as markers of open
chromatin and high genomic activity across the complete
human genome [54]. Di Filippo & Bernardi [55] have
shown, using a smaller data set, that the DNase I HS sites
density is greater in heavy isochores. Note that the Boyle
et al. [54] data were obtained from primary human CD4+T
cells and not from germline cells. Investigating breakpoint
density versus DNase I HS sites coverage, we found an
increase of the breakpoint density from 0.1 Mb-1 in
regions without any DNase I HS sites to 0.6 Mb-1 in

regions with the largest DNase I HS sites coverage (Fig.
5(b)). This comparison of breakpoint density to an experimental marker of genome accessibility provides additional support to the hypothesis that a major determinant
of BPR localisation is open chromatin.
Such parameters all correlate with each other, so that it is
difficult to disentangle them and find which are the true
causal relationships. Nevertheless, we can control for the
effects of some variables, and assess that GC content does
not explain all the results. These observations are in agreement with our hypothesis that the regions of open chromatin make the genome more susceptible to evolutionary
breakages, and may explain the surprising co-localisation
of BPRs with small intergenes.

Conclusion
In this paper, we analysed the relation between evolutionary breakpoint density and the organisation of the
genome. This study shows that the susceptibility to breakage is highly heterogeneous along human chromosomes.
Even though it is difficult to be definite on which parameter best describes the positions of BPRs since they all correlate with one another due to the organisation of the
human genome into isochores, the results reported in this
work reveal the importance of intergene size. The high

breakpoint density in small intergenes can not be simply
explained by the current model of structural genome evolution, namely the Intergenic Breakage Model, and we
suggest a DNA accessibility-driven scenario, supported by
data on methylation, transcriptional activity, replication
initiation and experimental DNAse sensitivity, to explain
this surprising result. If the proposition is correct, it would
constitute the first evidence for a mechanistic explanation
at a local scale (50 kb) without obvious relationship to
natural selection whose influence is nevertheless clearly
perceived on the systematically lower breakpoint density
found in genic as compared to intergenic regions. Altogether our results enlighten the susceptibility of open
chromatin regions to breakage as a third force to add to
the evolutionary rearrangement description proposed by
Becker & Lenhard [5] where positive selection is rare and
negative selection protects some loci.

Methods
Sequence and annotation data
Sequence and annotation data were retrieved from the
Genome Browsers of the University of California Santa
Cruz (UCSC) [56] and of the Ensembl project [57]. The
following releases of genome assemblies were used:
human assembly of May 2004 (NCBI35 or hg17), chimpanzee assembly of March 2006 (panTro2.1), macaque

Open chromatin regions present a high breakpoint density
Open chromatin regions present a high breakpoint density. Intergenic breakpoint density estimated using model M1
versus (a) CpG ratio and (b) coverage by DNase I hypersensitive sites. Data points were obtained by (i) ordering 50 kb windows according to their CpG ratio (resp. Dnase I HS sites coverage), (ii) grouping them into classes of equal number of intergenic breakpoints and (iii) computing intergenic breakpoint density and average CpG ratio (resp. Dnase I HS sites coverage)
over each class. Vertical bars represent the standard deviations (see Methods); horizontal bars represent the ranges of CpG
ratio (resp. Dnase I HS sites coverage) over each class.

assembly of February 2006 (MMUL1.0 or rheMac2), dog
assembly of May 2005 (canFam2), mouse assembly of
December 2005 (NCBIm35 or mm7), and rat assembly of
December 2004 (RGSC 3.4 or rn4). Since chromosome Y
was not available for all genomes, it was disregarded in all
the analyses. In the same manner, all unsequenced region
(e.g. centromeres) were not included in the analysis. As
human gene coordinates, we used the UCSC Known
Genes table. When several genes presenting the same orientation overlapped, they were merged into one gene
whose coordinates corresponded to the union of all the
overlapping gene coordinates. This resulted in 20349 distinct genes over the 22 human autosomes and chromosome X.
GC content was computed over the native sequence. We
checked that the results remained qualitatively similar
when considering the GC content computed over the
repeat-masked sequence or when masking CpG islands as
annotated in the UCSC database. CpG observed/expected
ratio (CpG o/e) was computed as

n C pG
L −l

2
× n Ln

C G

, where

nC, nG and nCpG are the number of C, G and dinucleotide
CG counted along the sequence, L is the number of nonmasked nucleotides of the sequence and l the number of

masked nucleotide gaps plus one, i.e. L - l is the number
of dinucleotide sites. The CpG o/e was computed over the
sequence where annotated CpG islands were masked. We
checked that the results remained qualitatively similar
when considering the CpG o/e computed over the native
sequence or over the repeat-masked sequence.
The 95 723 experimental DNase I hypersensitive (HS) site
data (UCSC "dukeDnaseCd4Sites" track) corresponds to
genome-wide DNase I HS sites as determined for human
CD4+ T-cells using DNase-sequencing and DNase-chip by
Boyle et al. [54].
Precise detection of rearrangement breakpoint regions
In order to analyse the positions of evolutionary breakpoints relatively to small scale features of the genome
such as genes or replication domains, we constructed a
high resolution database of BPR coordinates along the
human genome using a novel methodology, henceforth
denoted by CASSIS, described in [31]. This method precisely locates BPRs on a reference genome by comparison
with the genome of a related species. Contrary to previous
methods which search for synteny blocks and simply
return what remains in the genome as BPRs, the framework of CASSIS consists in building synteny blocks from
orthologous markers and in further investigating the BPRs

Page 8 of 12

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:335

themselves in order to refine their coordinates. By aligning each breakpoint sequence on the reference genome
against its specific orthologous sequences in the other species, CASSIS looks for weak similarities inside the BPRs,
thus extending the synteny blocks and narrowing the
BPRs [31]. Using this method, the human genome was
compared to the following five eutherian mammals
which have a sequenced and assembled genome: chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat and dog. For each human/
non-human pairwise comparison, we used the one-to-one
orthologous genes available from the Ensembl genome
browser [57] as the orthologous markers to build the initial synteny blocks. For the purpose of this paper, we
extended the method of Lemaitre et al. [31] by combining
the coordinates of overlapping BPRs obtained from each
of the pairwise comparisons to build the final set of BPR
coordinates. We identified which BPR common to several
genome pairs were likely to account for the same rearrangement event by building a graph G where vertices are
the BPRs mapped on the human genome, and edges join
every two intersecting BPRs. A group S of species is considered monophyletic in an unrooted phylogenetic tree if every
leaf of the smallest sub-tree containing all species from S
are in S. For every connected component of the graph G,
we tested if:
• there exists a unique common intersection to all BPRs;
• the non-human species involved in the component are
monophyletic.
If both conditions are satisfied, then all the BPRs in the
component may account for a single rearrangement event.
If one condition is not satisfied, then at least two events
are necessary to explain the component. In the first case, a
single BPR is constructed from the component by taking
the common intersection of all the regions in the component. In the second case, a single BPR is constructed from
the component by taking the union of all regions involved
in the component (see a full description of the method in
Additional File 1). We thus obtained 622 BPRs. The size
distribution of the BPRs has a mean value of 104 kb, a
standard deviation of 252 kb and a median size of 26.6 kb
(Fig. 1). The coordinates of BPRs on the human genome
along with their evolutionary branch assignment are provided in Additional File 2, together with a high level
graphical representation of their distribution along the
human chromosomes (Additional File 3).
Estimating breakpoint density
A genomic subset GS is the union of non-overlapping
intervals GSj of size L(GSj) along the human genome. The
BPRs constitute a particular genomic subset defined by
intervals Bi of size L(Bi). In order to be able to take into

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/335

account the fact that each BPR may actually correspond to
several independent breakage events, we associated a
number ni of breakpoints to every Bi (1 in the M1 model
of the BPR data set). Furthermore, since we lacked information on the exact location of breakpoints within the
BPRs, we associated a uniform breakpoint density d(Bi) =
ni/L(Bi) to each Bi. Then, the expectation of the number of
breakpoints over an interval of interest GSj is E(nj) =
Σid(Bi)L(Bi ∩ GSj). The breakpoint density dGS for the set
of intervals GSj is defined by the following expectation
value:

∑ j E(n j )

d GS =

∑ j L(GS j )

.

For instance, if we compute the breakpoint density over
genic regions of the genome on one hand (the genic
breakpoint density) and over intergenic regions on the
other hand (the intergenic breakpoint density), a BPR
spanning both genic and intergenic regions will be
counted both times but with a weight proportional to its
overlap with, respectively, the genic and the intergenic
regions.
Assuming the RBM is applicable when considering the
distribution of breakpoints along the set of intervals GSj,
the estimated number of breakpoints over these intervals
corresponds to the expectation of a binomial distribution
for a series of L({GSj}) = Σj L(GSj) trials of probability dGS.
In this framework, an a priori standard deviation for dGS
reads s d GS =

d GS (1− d GS )
L({GS j })

≈

d GS
L({GS j })

.

Randomisation of BPR positions
As control experiments, we studied the breakpoint density
when the set of BPRs is chosen at random along the
genome, respecting the size distribution of the observed
set of BPRs. A BPR data set with randomised positions was
constructed by randomly taking each BPR one by one and
randomly re-positioning it along the complete genome
avoiding overlap with a previously re-positioned BPR or
with an assembly gap of size > 200 kb. One thousand BPR
data sets with randomised positions were generated.
When averaging breakpoint density estimations ds over

these 1000 BPR data sets, we also computed the empirical
standard deviation, comparable to the a priori standard
deviation used for the observed BPR data sets, as:

(

1000
s d = ⎛ ∑ s =1 d s − d
⎜
⎝
metic mean of ds.

)

Replication domains and putative replication origins
The detection of human replication N-domains is based on
the mammalian replicon model [58,59]. This model with
fixed replication origins and randomly distributed termination sites, imposes an N-shaped profile for the nucleotide
compositional
strand
asymmetry

tion origins. Using the wavelet transform as a multi-scale
(the distance between origins is highly variable) shape
detector, Huvet et al. [46] developed a very efficient segmentation strategy of the human genome into candidate
replication domains where the skew S displays the characteristic N-shaped pattern. Note that this segmentation
strategy is less efficient in GC rich regions of the genome.
Indeed, the smaller N-domain size and the high gene density in these regions make it difficult to distinguish replication-related
from
transcription-related
strand
asymmetry [46].

The coordinates of the 678 human replication N-domains
were obtained directly from the authors [46]. The 1060 Ndomain borders (in 296 cases, a border is shared by two
domains) were considered as putative replication origins
(ORIs). Within the 22 human autosomes and chromosome X, the N-domains cover 28.5% of the sequenced
genome length and 17% of the genes (3431 gene starts are
in an N-domain).
