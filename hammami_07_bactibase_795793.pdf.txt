Abstract
Background: Bacteriocins are very diverse group of antimicrobial peptides produced by a wide
range of bacteria and known for their inhibitory activity against various human and animal
pathogens. Although many bacteriocins are now well characterized, much information is still
missing or is unavailable to potential users. The assembly of such information in one central
resource such as a database would therefore be of great benefit to the exploitation of these
bioactive molecules in the present context of increasing antibiotic resistance and natural biopreservation need.
Description: In the present paper, we present the development of a new and original database
BACTIBASE that contains calculated or predicted physicochemical properties of 123 bacteriocins
produced by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The information in this database is
very easy to extract and allows rapid prediction of relationships structure/function and target
organisms of these peptides and therefore better exploitation of their biological activity in both the
medical and food sectors.
Conclusion: The BACTIBASE database is freely available at http://bactibase.pfba-lab.org, webbased platform enabling easy retrieval, via various filters, of sets of bacteriocins that will enable
detailed analysis of a number of microbiological and physicochemical data.

Background
Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides produced by
many bacteria and display inhibitory activity against
closely related bacteria [1]. Bacteriocin production in
some bacteria is regulated by a widespread mechanism of
the quorum sensing type that appears to play a major role
in monitoring the cell density of a bacterial population in
a given environment [2].
Since their discovery by [3] in 1925, nearly 300 bacteriocins have been identified and some of them have been used
successfully for inhibiting both animal and human pathogens [4,5]. A few of these have been well characterized
and information such as amino acid sequence and spectra
of antimicrobial activity are now available. However, for
many other bacteriocins, this kind of information is still
missing or is scattered in the scientific literature and therefore unavailable to potential users. This situation could be
improved by a central resource such as a database in
which data could be collected, analyzed and used to generate new and useful information.
The majority of sequenced bacteriocins are stored in the
manually annotated UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database and
relevant data are available as information about mode of
action, 3D-structure data, post-translationally modification of the precursor protein in order to release the mature
active peptides, interactions with other proteins, cross-references to external databases and Prosite patterns or profiles. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot represents a large database
with broad domains. Thus, there is a clear need to gather,
filter and critically evaluate this mass of information and
store into smaller, more specialized, resources so that it
can then be used in a way that enhances efficiency. Three
different databases have been created for antimicrobial
peptides and are mentioned in the literature. Two of these,
namely ANTIMIC [6] and APD [7] contain very general
information about peptides of all types having antibacterial, antifungal or antiviral activities and originating from
either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. Bacteriocins are not
described with a useful amount of detail in either of these
databases. For example, ANTIMIC database contains no
information on nisin, one of the most studied and used
lactic acid bacterial bacteriocins, while the APD database
provides no information about the structure of this bacteriocin. Recently, a new database named BAGEL was created and described [8]. BAGEL represents a genome
mining tool that allows detection of putative bacteriocin
gene clusters in (new) bacterial genomes. This database
contains information based on bacteriocin gene clusters
but not on protein properties.
A new database designed specifically for bacteriocins is
therefore needed. The microbial physicochemical and
structural proprieties provided in such database would

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/89

allow better and more comprehensive structural and functional analysis of this special group of antimicrobial peptides. This would certainly be useful in food preservation
or food safety applications, but also has implications for
the development of new drugs for medical use.

Construction and content
BACTIBASE runs on a Windows NT platform (Microsoft
Windows 2000) with the Apache web-server (version
2.0.54), MySQL server (v 5.0.30) and PHP (v 4.3.11). The
web server and all parts of the database are hosted at the
Centre de Calcul El Khawarizmi (CCK), Tunisia. Bacteriocin peptide sequences were collected from the UniProt
database [9] and from the scientific literature using
PubMed. Microbiological information was collected from
the literature by PubMed search. Since not all known bacteriocin sequences were present in the SRS server of
ExPASy [10] and the NCBI server [11], our accumulated
knowledge in combination with literature search was used
to complete the BACTIBASE sequence database. The Blast
program was used for the sequence homology search in
the database (BlastP version 2.2.15) [12]. Sequence alignment was done using the ClustalW program (version
1.83) [13]. The Java platform is required for visualizing
generated phylogenic trees. The peptides collected in this
version of BACTIBASE are mainly from natural sources.
Precursor sequences were removed to keep only mature
peptide sequences. For each peptide, a unique six-digit
identification number (ID) starting with the prefix BAC
was assigned. Each entry was checked in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) or UniProt database. A web link in BACTIBASE to UniProt and PDB was created for all peptides that
already exist in these databases, to facilitate consultation
of the original databases. In addition, each entry contains
general data such as peptide name, sequence, class, microbial data (producer organism, taxonomy and target bacterial organisms) and relevant references in Swiss protein
database. Additional physicochemical data are provided,
including empirical formula, mass, length, isoelectric
point, net charge, basic, acidic, hydrophobic and polar
residues, hydropathy index, binding potential index,
instability index, aliphatic index, half-life in mammalian
cells, yeast and E. coli, cysteine and glycine content, extinction coefficient, absorbance at 280 nm, absent and most
prevalent amino acids, secondary (α-helix or β-strand)
and tertiary structure (when available), physical method
used for structural determination (e.g. NMR spectroscopy
or X-ray diffraction) and critical residues for activity, when
information is available.

Utility and Discussion
Database description
The database main page contains the following interfaces:

interface), user sequence analysis interface, user sequence
BLAST interface, statistical data, useful links and Contact
information. The query interface provides quick or
advanced search with a variety of parameters. Users can
find a specific bacteriocin peptide using its ID, name or
Swiss-Prot ID, query for lists of bacterial organisms targeted by a bacteriocin or for lists of bacteriocins that target
a specific organism. Detailed information for each entry
in the database can be viewed by clicking on the bacteriocin name. The advanced search tool allows query of all
available data.

structural analysis, the number of peptides with a defined
structural type is shown.
Statistical description and findings
The current version of BACTIBASE holds 123 bacteriocins,
113 secreted by Gram-positive bacteria and 10 by Gramnegative bacteria. Classification has been proposed on the
basis of primary structure [14-16]. Various bacterial species produce bacteriocins. The lactic acid bacteria (order
Lactobacillales) are the predominant group of producers.
Of those in our database, 86 are produced by lactic acid
bacteria, two by halobacteria, six by actinobacteria, 18 by
bacilli, four by clostridia and seven by proteobacteria. For
81.3%, the amino acid sequence length varies from 20 to
60 (Figure 1). Table 1 summarizes the amino acid percentages. Glycine is the most abundant amino acid and 93.5%
of these bacteriocins contain at least glycine residue. Calculated Pearson coefficients (r = 0.635) revealed a positive
correlation between sequence length and number of glycine residues, indicating that glycine content is fairly constant (Figure 2). It is noteworthy that 25% of the
sequences do not contain cysteine and about 32% contain
only one pair, as can be seen in Figure 3. We also note low
proline content, with over 74% of the amino acid
sequences containing either one residue or none. The
majority (71%) of sequences have net charges varying
from 0 to +5, less than 18% possess a positive charge superior to +5, with the highest being +12 (BAC107) (Figure
4). In addition, only 11.4% of the sequences have a net
negative charge, the most negatively charged bacteriocin
having a net charge of -4 (BAC097). As a result, the aver-

When a sequence is entered, the program returns all peptides containing this sequence and search results can be
sorted into visible columns. A combinatorial search can
be done by query of search results. Files containing the
sequence (Fasta format) may be downloaded for all of the
entries identified by the query, to facilitate other analyses.
Registered users can also download output result tables in
XLS and DOC format. Users may also submit their own
sequences for physicochemical analysis via an interface
with prompts. In addition, BLAST enables users to search
the database for homologous sequences and save successful results temporarily in the server for subsequent access.
Users may thus select some or all of the homologous
sequences for multiple aligning with their submitted
sequences. The statistical interface provides data on peptide sequence, function and structure. The average length,
net charge and amino acid residue percentages for all
entries in the database are also listed, as is the frequency
of given values for each physicochemical parameter. For

As future developments, we plan to integrate a system that
will allow automatic prediction of bacteriocin secondary
structure, functional amino acids and a server for building
tertiary structures by homology with existent bacteriocin

Conclusion
BACTIBASE allows all bacteriocins sequence and information data to be accessed via a user-friendly, web-based
interface. The database can be queried using various criteria, and retrieval, at either microbiological or physicochemical level, includes specific information on each
bacteriocin. The provided microbial physicochemical and
structural proprieties would allow better and more comprehensive structural and functional analysis of this special group of antimicrobial peptides. BACTIBASE should
help enhance our understanding of bacteriocins biology.
This would certainly be useful in food preservation or
food safety applications, but also has implications for the
development of new drugs for medical use.
