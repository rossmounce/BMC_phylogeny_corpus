Abstract
Background: A number of vertebrate highly conserved elements (HCEs) have been detected and
their genomic interval distances have been reported to be more conserved than protein coding
genes among mammalian genomes. A characteristic of the human – non-mammalian comparisons
is a bimodal distribution of relative distance difference of conserved consecutive HCE pairs; and it
is difficult to attribute such profile to a random assortment. We therefore undertook an analysis
of the human genomic regions confined by consecutive HCE pairs common to eight genomes
(human, mouse, rat, chicken, frog, zebrafish, tetradon and fugu).
Results: Among HCE pairs, we found that some consistently preserve highly conserved interval
distance among genomes while others have relatively low distance conservation. Using a partition
method, we detected two groups of inter-HCE regions (IHRs) with distinct distance conservation
pattern in vertebrate genomes: IHR1s that are bordered by HCE pairs with relative small distance
variation, and IHR2s with larger distance difference values. Compared to random background,
annotated repeat sequences are significantly less frequent in IHR1s than IHR2s, which reflects a
correlation between repeat sequences and the length expansion of IHRs. Both groups of IHRs are
unexpectedly enriched in human indel (i.e. insertion and deletion) polymorphism-variations than
random background. The correlation between the percentage of conserved sequence and human
IHR length was stronger for IHR1 than IHR2. Both groups of IHRs are significantly enriched for
CpG islands.
Conclusion: The data suggest that subsets of HCE pairs may undergo different evolutionary paths
in light of their genomic distance conservation, and that sets of genomic regions pertain to HCEs,
as well as the region in which HCEs reside, should be treated as integrated domains.

Background
Comparative sequence analysis has become an essential
component for studying genome function. Genome-wide

comparison of human and rodents DNA sequences discovered more than 5,000 ultraconserved elements (UCEs)
of absolute identity and >100 bp in length [1], of which

77 percent were located outside annotated exons, and
long-range comparison between man and pufferfish also
identified high numbers of similar genomic elements
[2,3]. A common characteristic of these highly conserved
elements is their strong tendency to occur in clusters along
the mammalian chromosomes [1-4] with their relative
order as conserved as that of protein coding genes [5]. A
relative distance difference (RDD) measure was defined to
evaluate the genomic distance change ratio of pairs of
UCEs found at adjacent positions in the human, mouse
and dog genomes, showing that the genomic distance
between such elements is significantly more conserved
than corresponding genomic distance between orthologous protein coding genes [5]. An intriguing observation
is that the conservation of the genomic distance between
pairs of UCEs [1] also exists in the preliminary analyses of
evolutionarily more distant vertebrates, and displayed a
distinct pattern with a fraction of UCE pairs displaying
nearly unaltered genomic distances over long evolutionary distances and a second fraction of UCE pairs with less
conserved genomic distances [5]. It is hard to imagine that
such genomic distance profile could arise by random as it
was consistently found in comparisons between several
genomes, and suggests that the genomic distance conservation may take on different characteristics corresponding
to different genomic regions.
Genomic sequences have been divided into functional
blocks based on various characteristics, e.g. biological
roles or sequence conservation. Early research works
mainly focused on synteny blocks defined according to
conserved DNA sequences or orthologous genes to study
the evolutionary history of rearrangements in entire
genomes [6-8]. Concordant higher-order patterns from
functional genomic studies suggest that the human
genome and other large genomes are organized into
higher-order functional domains [9]. For example,
genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements, developmental regulatory
target gene(s), and phylogenetically and functionally
unrelated "bystander" genes, are conserved between
mammal and fishes [10]. The identification and study of
these higher-order functional domains within the human
genome is of great importance. Our early observation of
distinct two-peak distribution profiles in genomic distance conservation suggested that some other aspect of the
DNA sequences adjacent to the UCE pairs may likewise be
different, and might thus be treated as two distinct
genomic regions or blocks [5].
Different sets of highly conserved elements (HCEs) vary
somewhat with respect to their locations in the human
genome, some are exclusively found in non-protein-coding sequence (e.g. CNEs [2] and UCRs [3]) and others
contain exons of protein-coding genes (UCEs [1]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/133

Though it has been suggested that exonic UCEs represent
a distinct subset [11], no satisfactory explanations for the
extreme degree of sequence conservation of exonic UCEs
have been presented. In our previous study [5], we have
shown that with respect to distance conservation there
were no substantial differences between different data sets
(i.e. UCEs [1], CNEs [2] and UCRs [3]) or between UCE
pairs with exonic and non-exonic locations. We have
therefore integrated the three datasets [1-3] and undertaken an analysis of the human genomic regions confined
by HCE pairs common to eight genomes (human, mouse,
rat, chicken, frog, zebrafish, tetradon and fugu).

Results
In our previous work, we calculated a relative distance difference (RDD [5]; Methods) value to assess whether the
genomic distances between consecutive UCEs show less
change than that between other adjacent genomic elements (i.e. genes and exons) in the human, mouse and
dog genomes. The analysis showed that in addition to an
extreme level of sequence conservation, UCEs also display
strong conservation of mutual genomic distances among
mammalian species [5]. The conservation of distance
between pairs of UCEs [1] is also found between evolutionarily more distant vertebrates, but the distributions of
RDD values show a persistent nature of distinct two-peak
profiles in all mammal – non-mammal comparisons,
with one peak close to zero, and another at a more negative value [5]. Low number of UCEs [1] was used in the
previous analysis therefore a large data set is warranted to
validate these findings.
To facilitate this investigation, we constructed a dataset
integrated from three independent works [1-3]. A direct
element by element comparison shows that two-thirds of
the non-exonic UCEs from data set [1] do not overlap
with HCEs from any of the two other data sets [see Additional file 1]. The smallest data set of ~1,400 conserved
non-coding elements (CNEs) [2] had the highest fraction
of overlaps (~80%) to data set [1] and [3], whereas the set
of ultraconserved regions (UCRs) [3] has ~50% overlaps
with others. We combined these three published data sets
[1-3] to form an integrated data set consisting of 7,570
distinct highly conserved elements (HCEs) in the human
genome. We used BLASTn with non-stringent parameters
and criteria for order and genomic distance conservation
to locate all occurrences of the same HCEs in the mouse,
rat, chicken, frog, zebrafish, fugu and tetraodon genomes
[see details in Methods; Additional file 2]. The resulted
number of orthologous HCEs that can be located
uniquely in the different genomes is variable: more than
95 percent of human HCEs could be anchored to the
rodent genomes, 71 percent to the chicken genome, and
around 24 to 30 percent in fish [see Additional file 3].
From the comparisons with the human genome more

than 99 percent of HCEs were found linked with at least
one other HCE/HCEs in all other genomes, including the
linkage relationship with quite a number of HCEs in the
fish genomes. More than sixty percent of HCEs were
found ordered together with at least 5 individual elements
[see Additional file 4], which indicates the tendency for
HCEs to preserve order conservation among vertebrate
species.
We calculated RDD values between pairs of HCEs and
compared them with RDD values for pairs of genes and
exons of these genes. Similar to what has been reported
for mammalian comparisons [5], the absolute relative distance difference (|RDD|) were significantly lower for HCE
pairs than for pairs of genes or exons [see Additional file
5; Wilcoxons unpaired test, p value < 2.2e-16]. Calculated
as absolute values (|RDD|), the median distance difference for HCE pairs in the human-chicken comparisons
was 0.46, which is about half that for gene pairs (0.91)
and exons (0.95) [see Additional file 5]. The difference
between distance conservation of HCE pairs and gene
pairs is most pronounced for the human – zebrafish comparison; median |RDD|HCE being only 32 percent of
median |RDD|gene. HCE-HCE absolute distance differences are also significantly less than exon-exon distance
differences (within gene); the latter being only slightly different from the gene-gene relative distance differences.
The RDD distribution profiles were also markedly different for the three different pair comparisons (HCE-HCE,
gene-gene, and exon-exon). The RDD distributions for
HCE pairs show distinct two-peak profiles, with one peak
close to zero and another at a more negative value. RDD
values for gene pairs, in contrast, show only one peak
skewed toward more negative values. The distributions of
exon RDD values are wider than for both HCE and gene
pairs. The distributions of all three data show a peak at relatively low RDD values (-1 to -2) for all four human –
chicken/fish comparisons [see Additional file 6]. However, the distribution of HCE RDD values consistently
show an additional, dominant peak around zero, indicating the existence of a subset of HCE-HCE pairs whose distances have been conserved across vertebrate evolution.
Even for Fugu and Tetraodon, whose genome sizes are
only around 13 percent of the human genome, the result
indicates that around 30 percent of the analyzed HCE
pairs have largely unaltered distances (i.e. |RDD| within ±
0.116~0.409) compared to the human genome [see Additional file 7].
A total of 403 HCE pairs are shared by the five non-mammalian species and human genome. The two-peak distribution profiles of RDD values still persist, with one peak
close to zero and another peak (or 'shoulder') at a more
negative value, as shown by mapping this integrated data
set of HCEs onto the five non-mammalian genomes (Fig-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/133

ure 1A). Most of these common HCE pairs are unique and
linked with each other in the query genomes as they do in
the human genome [see Additional file 8]. HCEs have
been reported to be unique and clustered in the human
genome [1-3], here we see a similar tendency in the nonmammalian genomes.
Inter-HCE regions with distinctive distance conservation
patterns
In addition to the persistent nature of the two-peak distribution profiles, a remaining question is whether there
exist any other characteristics pertaining to the regions
confined by the HCE pairs common to the human and
five non-mammalian genomes. To test this, we divided
the 403 HCE pairs into two groups by using a partitioning
clustering method based on the matrix of absolute RDD
(|RDD|) values for the human – non-mammalian comparisons (Methods). RDD values of group one HCE pairs
are centered around zero (Figure 1B), whereas those of
group two are more widely scattered around a more negative value (Figure 1C). The distances between group two
pairs (mean 46 Kb) are significantly longer than the distances between group one pairs (mean 2.8 Kb) [see Additional file 9; Wilcoxon test p value = 2.2e-16]. The |RDD|
value of two consecutive HCEs has been reported to be
positively correlated with the distance between the pair
[5], we see here a reflection of the same correlation. We
call the inter-HCE regions IHRs and subsequently classify
the IHRs into two types based on the (above mentioned)
partitioning result [see Additional file 10]. We obtained
188 IHRs (termed as IHR1s which are bordered by HCE
pairs with relative small |RDD| values), and 215 IHRs
(termed as IHR2s which are bordered by two consecutive
HCEs with larger |RDD| values). All these 403 HCE pairs
are also detected in the rodents. An intriguing observation
is that for any pair-wise comparisons among the eight
genomes, the median |RDD| values for HCE pairs of
IHR2s are constantly much higher than those values of
IHR1s [Figure 2, see Additional file 11]. Given the persistent nature of distinct distance conservation of the two
groups of IHRs, it is difficult to assume that such profile
was the result of a random assortment. Rather, it seems
more likely that subsets of HCE pairs may undergo different evolutionary paths in the sense of genomic distance
conservation.

We subsequently defined the subset of intergenic IHRs
when their flanking HCEs are intergenic in the human
genome with no genes in between. For both IHR1 and
IHR2 groups, there are more intergenic IHRs than other
categories, with 40 percent intergenic IHR1s and 49 percent intergenic IHR2s, respectively (Table 1). We further
calculated genomic distances between intergenic IHRs
and their closest neighboring genes. Using the distance to
the closest gene for statistical analysis, the average distance is 113 Kb for intergenic IHR1s and 150 Kb for interPage 3 of 12

is that ten IHR1s are clustered in a region close to 1 Mb,
and the corresponding eight HCE pairs are all located in
intergenic regions.

We also identified a few human genomic regions that are
spanned by the same type of IHRs, indicating that the distance variation of HCEs in these regions is probably associated [see Additional file 13]. An intriguing observation

Enrichment of DNA repeat sequences

sequences and it is believed there is a correlation between
genome size and repeat content. We therefore asked

whether there are any differences in the enrichment of
human DNA repeat sequences between IHRs and random
genomic regions. As both the number and length of the
two groups of IHRs are different, we used randomly
selected regions to test the significance. Repeat sequences
appear more frequently in IHR2s than in IHR1s. Compared with the sets of corresponding random regions,
repeat sequences are significantly less frequent in IHR1s
(43 percent, Table 3; p value < 0.001, 74 percent for the
random background), but more in IHR2s (97 percent,
Table 3; p value = 0.052, 94 percent for the random background). Here, we found a correlation between repeat
sequences and the length expansion of IHRs. Fewer IHR1s
containing repeat sequences may reflect evolutionary
pressure against either transposon-derived sequence in

these regions or the distance-distorting effects of inclusion
of longer repeat sequences between the bordering HCEs to
maintain the shorter IHR1 length.
We also found that both types of IHRs contain significantly less sequences of SINE (4.3% for IHR1s, 11.0% for
IHR2s), LINE (2.4% for IHR1s, 13.4% for IHR2s) and LTR
(0.6% for IHR1s, 4.7% for IHR2s) compared to the random backgrounds (Table 3; p value < 0.001); however,
both types of IHRs are significantly enriched in low complexity DNA sequences (4.9% for IHR1s, 0.7% for IHR2s)
(Table 3; p value < 0.001 for IHR1; p value = 0.016 for
IHR2;). We also tested the enrichment of long transposon-free regions (TFRs) in IHR1s and IHR2s. TFRs have
been reported to be associated with both protein coding
genes and UCEs [12]. Of the 188 IHR1s, 60 percent are
intersected with TFRs (2.6% for the random background);
and 52 percent of the 215 IHR2s are intersected with TFRs
[see Additional file 14; 12% for the random background].
Both groups of IHRs show a significant enrichment of
TFRs compared with random selected regions, indicating
a complex relationship between TFRs and distance conservation.
Unexpected enrichment of indel variation
Since HCEs are highly conserved at not only sequence
level but also their genomic organization (e.g. order and

distance), we suspected that IHRs might not tolerate any
large extent of rearrangements. We therefore asked
whether there are any differences in the distribution of
human indel (i.e. insertion and deletion) polymorphisms
in the IHRs.
Mills et al. [13] recently identified a set of small indels
from three different human populations. As a negative
control, we used randomly selected genomic regions with
the same number and length of corresponding IHR1s and
IHR2s, respectively. The frequency of which the random
samples had higher average scores than those of the IHRs
provided the basis for the statistical significance. None of
the IHR types are deleted in small indels, and IHR2s are
actually significantly enriched. We found that 16 percent
of IHR1s (30; p value = 0.241, 27 for the random background) versus 81 percent of IHR2s (174; p value < 0.001,
156 for the random background) contain small indels
[Table 4; see Additional file 15]. Both results are not in
accordance with the expected. Considering the highly
conserved length of IHR1s, less IHR1s are expected to contain indels than random background; and as many IHR2s

as random selected regions are expected to contain indels.
For the regions with indels, we calculated the percentage
of insertion/deletion base pairs over the whole length of
corresponding IHRs, and found no significant differences
in both types of IHRs compared with the randomly
selected human genomic regions [Table 4; see Additional
file 15]. Previous works have suggested that the genomewide indel rates are not uniform and that indel events are
not neutral [14]. Investigations of human indels indicated
that most indels have arisen from the most recent variation events [15,16]. In spite of the observation of overrepresentation of indels in human IHRs, the fact that the
length of IHRs remains highly conserved among vertebrate genomes than the distance of gene or exon pairs suggests that the distance between consecutive HCEs is under
high selection pressure and is important for HCEs to exert
their biological function.
Conserved sequences within IHRs
A previous observation is that |RDD| and sequence conservation are to some extent positively correlated [5]. We
used the datasets of phastCons elements provided by the

UCSC online server to test the conservation characteristic
within the IHRs. As for Tetraodon and Fugu, there are
presently no phastCons data from the UCSC online service, so these two genomes were excluded from the
sequence conservation analysis.
The correlation between the percentage of conserved
sequence and human IHR length is stronger for IHR1 than
for IHR2. The conservation percentage is below 50 percent
in almost all IHR2s, even in short IHR2s with length close
to IHR1s (Figure 3). Among the IHR1s, some have a high
percentage of conserved DNA sequence, whereas others
not. Considering the generally high degree of distance
conservation of the IHR1s, their length might have been
under a higher level of evolutionary constraint than the
DNA sequences within the regions.
In the human genome, the average length of conserved
elements is nearly the same in IHR1s and IHR2s (73 bp
for IHR1s and 76 bp for IHR2s, respectively; Table 5).
However, the average inter-distance between two consecutive conserved elements of IHR2s is almost 2.8 times
longer than the IHR1s (327 bp for IHR1s and 894 bp for
IHR2s; Table 5), thus resulting a lower average sequence
conservation for IHR2s. The same tendency was found for
the other three genomes. The phastCons element data
were derived by a multiple species alignment algorithm
[17], and the length of the same conserved fraction vary
little across the compared species and therefore contribute
little to the distance differences between species. No significant differences was observed in the length distribution of conserved fractions between the two groups of
IHRs in the human genome (Table 5; p value = 0.1798),
indicating that the same length of potential functional
sequences with lower sequence conservation occupying
the space of both groups of IHRs.
IHRs and CpG islands
Both groups of IHRs are significantly enriched for CpG
islands compared with the corresponding random backgrounds in the human genome: about 10 percent of
IHR1s (0.5% for the random background) and 14 percent

of IHR2s (2.3% for the random background) were found
to contain CpG islands [see Additional file 16, Additional
file 17; p value < 0.001]. We further tested the percentage
length of CpG islands and observed the difference: average 45% for IHR1s and 7% for IHR2s. The percentage
length of CpG islands between IHR1s and IHR2s is significantly different [see Additional file 16; Wilcoxon test, p
value < 5.5e-06].
For both IHR1s and IHR2s with CpG islands, the pair-wise
genomic loci of HCEs are only significantly sparse in the
"intronic-intronic" class [see Additional file 18; Hypergeometric test, p value = 0.0024], which can easily be understood that there are exonic sequences residing in between
the HCEs and that promoter elements (i.e. CpG islands)
are less likely to be located in the exonic regions. We next
checked the environment of those intergenic-intergenic
IHRs with CpG islands, eleven/fifteen intergenic IHR1s/
IHR2s were found with CpG islands, respectively (Table
2). Eight intergenic IHR1s with CpG islands are more than
8 Kb away from the closest gene. Fifteen IHR2s with CpG
islands are located in the intergenic regions; only three
reside in the regions less than 10 Kb away from the nearest
gene. A high percentage of intergenic IHRs are more than
10 Kb away from the nearest genes.
HCEs are frequently found in relatively gene poor regions
[3], and their distances are conserved among the mammalian genomes [5]. Our data show that IHRs shared by the
six vertebrates are also enriched in gene poor regions of
their genomes. CpG islands are generally associated with
human promoters [18] and most promoter-associated
CpG islands that have been reported are located within 2
Kb regions around transcription start sites [19,20]. The
enrichment of CpG islands in the IHRs over the random
background genomic regions suggests the possibility of
the existence of potential target genes, and the long distance between the IHRs and the nearest gene indicates
that putative targets might be located in a wider genomic
range, or that the CpG islands residing in the IHRs along
with the two side HCEs could together perform important

Discussion

different evolutionary paths for their genomic distance

functional regions constituted by HCEs and their interior
or adjacent sequences, and found that the precise spacing

genomes [5] indicates the feasibility that HCEs are not

independent and that two or more HCEs may function
together with adjacent sequences as a combined unit. We
are not the first to propose the viewpoint that a portion of
genomic region function as a united block. Chromosomal
segments termed "genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs)"
have been annotated in the human genome, formed by
conserved relationships between HCEs and their assumed
target genes [10]. Higher-order functional architecture
also illuminates functional domain structure of the
ENCODE regions [9].
Early observations of HCEs strongly suggested their function as acting on vertebrate cis-regulatory elements (cREs)
of early developmental genes [2,21,22], however cREs are
not necessarily strongly conserved but have been regarded
as more 'evolvable' than coding sequences [23]. Highly
complex correlations between HCEs and their putative
target genes also question the idea that the primary function of HCEs is as cis-regulatory elements [24]. Recently,
function as "counting units" has been suggested to be
associated with such elements [11]. Overlapping, multiple functions have been suggested by several studies to
account for the extreme sequence conservation of HCEs
[4]. HCE-rich regions are reported to be associated with
histone methylation [25]. Increasing evidence suggested
their functional association with chromatin remodeling
accompanying the involvement of HCEs in other functions like cREs. Most intergenic IHRs are located far away
from annotated protein coding genes. Both long distance
and relatively close related associations between HCEs
and genes were identified [24]. If the IHRs contain elements for chromatin structure and thus perform epige-

netic regulation of gene transcription, this would either
indicate a form of long distance regulatory action, or that
other functional elements (not protein coding genes) are
associated with these IHRs, or that the IHRs are per se functional units independent of target genes.
We detected 188 IHR1s with extremely conserved distances among deeply divergent species. Distance conservation between highly divergent organisms implies the
extreme constraint on the evolution of the IHR1 lengths,
which strongly suggests that their distances are functionally important. One possible interpretation for the less
conservation of IHR2 lengths would be that some functional elements were inserted or deleted in the IHR2s, or
alternatively, the expanded distance is indeed the requirement of difference in their potential biological function
among genomes.

Conclusion
In this study, the bimodal distribution profiles of RDD
values still persisted when mapping the integrated data set
of HCEs onto the five non-mammalian genomes. We
detected two groups of genomic regions confined by HCE
pairs with distinct distance conservation pattern in vertebrate genomes. The data suggests these IHRs may function
as combined unit, and that subsets of IHRs with distinct
space conservation should be treated differently.

Methods
Data
Genome sequences were downloaded from UCSC GoldenPath database for the 7 species: human (hg18), mouse

(mm7), rat (rn4), chicken (galGal2), frog (xenTro2),
zebrafish (danRer3), tetraodon (tetNrg1) and fugu (fr1).
UCE [1] and CNE [2] dataset were obtained from the
respective authors. The UCR [3] dataset was obtained
from
http://mordor.cgb.ki.se/GeneReg.net%20Home
.html. The TFR (>5 kb) data set was obtained from http://
jsm-group.imb.uq.edu.au/tfr/[12]. The collections of
annotated genes, the transposon, the repeat and CpG
island annotation files for the human genome were
downloaded from UCSC GoldenPath database http://
hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath. Collections of pair
wise orthologous groups between human and other
genomes were downloaded from the InParanoid database
[26].

BLASTn hits pairs, we treat them as the corresponding
HCEs in the non-mammal genomes on the condition of
linkage with other HCE pairs or orthologous genes.
Because HCEs tend to be located in clusters, linkage condition of HCE pairs is the first screening step. Thus, the
corresponding |RDD| value might not be the minimum.
If there were no existing linkage, the two consecutive
HCEs with minimum |RDD| value were kept and thus
positioned the corresponding HCEs in the query genome.

The three datasets of conserved elements were integrated
together. Using the human genome as the reference, we
extended physical loci to the most remote start/end positions of those elements that have intersections with each
other, and we obtained 7,570 highly conserved elements
(HCEs) without overlap.

Calculation of relative distance differences between HCE
pairs
To investigate the conservation of distances between the
HCEs pairs, we used the same definition as presented in
our previous work [5], i.e. RDD = (dq-dh)/[(dq+dh)/2]; dq
and dh being the distance between the mid-points of two
HCEs of a pair in the query (non-human) and human
genomes [see Additional file 20], respectively.

Assignment of unique homologous HCE hits
The human HCE sequences were mapped onto the rodent
(mouse and rat) and five non-mammalian vertebrate
genomes (chicken, frog, zebrafish, fugu and tetraodon)
with non-stringent BLASTn parameters (mismatch penalty -1, gap open penalty 1, word size 9, and soft masking). Hits for each HCE with an e-value ≤ 10-5 were
considered to be under constraints of sequence conservation and kept for further analysis.

A number of HCEs have multiple BLASTn hits in the nonmammalian genomes [see Additional file 19]. To determine which hit is potentially the orthologous one is difficult with only sequence similarity information. The
relative order of UCEs along the chromosomes has been
found to be nearly identical among mammalian genomes,
at a level similar to that of genes and strong conservation
of mutual distances among vertebrate species was also
found [5]. Thus, criterions of consecutiveness and distance conservation were added to locate the HCEs
uniquely onto the non-mammalian genomes [see Additional file 2]. For the cases where some HCEs have multialignment hits and some have no BLASTn hit in the query
genome, two hits were looked as one pair according to the
query genome, if there are less than two other HCEs
located in between the two consecutive HCEs in the nonhuman genomes. RDD [5] values were calculated to measure the conservation of distance between the HCEs pairs.
The pairs which were unique in the non-mammal genome
were kept, and were divided into three categories according to their linkage relationship with other HCE pairs or
associated orthologous genes. For the HCEs with multi-

Assignment of homologous element pairs
Two HCEs or genes were regarded as a conserved pair if
they were found as neighbors in the genomes of both (or
all) the species compared [see Additional file 20].

Partitioning HCE pairs into two groups
By using R clustering function 'pam', we partitioned 403
HCE pairs shared by the five pair wise genomes intro 2
groups based on their |RDD| values dissimilarity matrix.
The 'pam' algorithm is a more robust version of K-means,
and it is based on the search for 'k' (the number of clusters
specified, we let k equal to 2) representative objects or
medoids among the observations of the dataset. These
observations should represent the structure of the data.
After finding a set of 'k' medoids, 'k' clusters are constructed by assigning each observation to the nearest
medoid. The goal is to find 'k' representative objects,
which minimize the sum of the dissimilarities of the
observations to their closest representative object.

We limited inter-HCE regions (IHRs) with boundary
marked by the HCE pairs by removing HCEs themselves.
Random sampling
We randomly selected the same number of regions with
same size as IHRs as a negative control. To evaluate the
statistical significance of the features of the IHRs, analysis
was repeated 1,000 times with independent, randomly
sampled data sets. The fraction of times in which the random sample sets had higher (or lower) average scores
than those of the IHRs provided the basis for the statistical
significance.

Statistical analyses were carried out using the R language
[27].
