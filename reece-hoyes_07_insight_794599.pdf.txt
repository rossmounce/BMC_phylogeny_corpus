Abstract
Background: The C. elegans Promoterome is a powerful resource for revealing the regulatory
mechanisms by which transcription is controlled pan-genomically. Transcription factors will form
the core of any systems biology model of genome control and therefore the promoter activity of
Promoterome inserts for C. elegans transcription factor genes was examined, in vivo, with a
reporter gene approach.
Results: Transgenic C. elegans strains were generated for 366 transcription factor promoter/gfp
reporter gene fusions. GFP distributions were determined, and then summarized with reference to
developmental stage and cell type. Reliability of these data was demonstrated by comparison to
previously described gene product distributions. A detailed consideration of the results for one C.
elegans transcription factor gene family, the Six family, comprising ceh-32, ceh-33, ceh-34 and unc-39
illustrates the value of these analyses. The high proportion of Promoterome reporter fusions that
drove GFP expression, compared to previous studies, led to the hypothesis that transcription
factor genes might be involved in local gene duplication events less frequently than other genes.
Comparison of transcription factor genes of C. elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae was therefore
carried out and revealed very few examples of functional gene duplication since the divergence of
these species for most, but not all, transcription factor gene families.
Conclusion: Examining reporter expression patterns for hundreds of promoters informs, and
thereby improves, interpretation of this data type. Genes encoding transcription factors involved
in intrinsic developmental control processes appear acutely sensitive to changes in gene dosage
through local gene duplication, on an evolutionary time scale.

Background
A proper understanding of complex biological processes
may well require a complete knowledge of all the contributing elements, an appreciation of the operation of the
entire system. However, the precise quantities of and the
range of gene products constituting an individual cell may
well be unique to each cell generated during each animal's
development. Each cell will occupy at least a subtly
unique environment within the body and will have followed at least a subtly unique developmental history as a
consequence of the stochastic nature of molecular level
events. A primary determinant of the spectrum of gene
products in each cell will be the spectrum of sequence specific transcription factors that have driven expression of
the genome during that cell's developmental history. The
scale of this problem, which needs to be addressed to fully
understand an animal's development, would be dramatically reduced by using a species in which development, at
least down to the level of individual cells, is invariant.
These considerations make the free-living soil nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans an excellent choice for systems biology approaches [1]. Furthermore, the remarkable conservation of biological processes, at the molecular genetic
level, means that findings with this animal are likely to be
widely relevant.
The essentially invariant and fully described developmental cell lineage of C. elegans [2] provides a framework
within which the systems biology of this animal can be
understood and could be depicted. C. elegans was also the
first animal to have its genome sequenced [3] and this has
lead to a plethora of genome-wide analyses using various
technologies to study gene function [4,5]. Maps of gene
expression, in terms of the cell lineage, will be essential to
integration of these datasets.
Typically, C. elegans gene expression pattern data are gathered, in terms of the cell lineage, using strains transformed
with reporter gene fusions [6,7]. This approach combines
the highest resolution with the efficiency necessary for
high throughput studies. A genomic DNA segment containing a C. elegans gene's regulatory regions is joined to a
reporter gene and, after the fusion gene is introduced into
the genome by transformation, the distribution of the
reporter gene product can be readily determined, in situ, in
large numbers of individuals of the transgenic strains.
Whether the fusion gene is intended to report on just a
gene's promoter activity, by driving reporter expression
with a DNA fragment from immediately upstream of the
gene start [8], or to report on the distribution of the gene
product, by seamless insertion of the reporter into the
protein coding region within a large multi-gene DNA fragment [9], there can be questions about how accurately the
observations reflect expression of the endogenous gene.
Have all the relevant regulatory elements really been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/27

included in the fusion? Furthermore, for the majority of
transgenic C. elegans strains the introduced DNA is maintained as an extrachromosomal array, with hundreds of
copies of the fusion gene all joined together in each cell,
not even integrated into a proper C. elegans chromosome
[10]. Does this unnatural environment also modify the
expression pattern of the fusion gene?
Our attention has been directed at the promoter regions
of C. elegans transcription factor genes. The C. elegans
genome is more densely packed than most other animal
genomes with over half the genome found in transcribed
regions [3]. Expression is initiated by transcription driven
from the promoter located immediately upstream of the
transcription unit. Regulatory elements through which
the activity of a promoter is controlled are generally found
to be concentrated in the immediately upstream intergenic region (e.g. [11,12]), perhaps a reflection of the high
gene density in this species. Therefore these regions have
been the specific subject of a large-scale cloning project,
generating the Promoterome [8]. C. elegans promoters
were cloned using the MultiSite Gateway system [13] so
that exactly the same DNA fragments could be subject to
multiple large scale analyses, including reporter fusion [8]
and protein::DNA interaction [14] assays. Transcriptional
regulatory elements and the transcription factors that
bind to them will lie at the core of any model of the control of expression of the genome and so we chose to start
our analysis with Promoterome clones for transcription
factor genes [15].
Promoterome inserts for C. elegans transcription factor
genes were transferred by Gateway recombination into a
reporter vector for fusion to gfp [8]. The C. elegans unc-119
gene was included in the vector backbone to allow selection following transformation by microprojectile bombardment [16]. This procedure yields transgenic lines with
the transforming DNA inserted at low copy number into
C. elegans chromosomes, as well as transgenic lines with
the transforming DNA present in extrachromosomal
arrays, the typical product of transformation by the more
traditional microinjection method [10]. The GFP expression, in all transgenic lines established, was examined
through all stages of development by fluorescence microscopy. The reliability of the reporter expression pattern
data generated was evaluated and conclusions were drawn
concerning transcription factor evolution.

Results and discussion
C. elegans transcription factor gene promoter/reporter
gene fusions
A recent comprehensive analysis of the C. elegans genome
using a combination of computational and manual interrogation methods compiled a list of 934 putative transcription factor genes, wTF2.0 [15] and this formed the

starting point of our investigation. Expression patterns
were determined for 366 of the 640 Promoterome clones
so far generated for these genes.
The Promoterome clones contain DNA fragments of varying length but all ending at the start of the protein coding
region for each gene. The translational initiation codon
was selected as the downstream end point in the cloned
DNA fragment of each promoterome clone, as trans-splicing means the transcriptional start is known for few C. elegans genes. However, 5' UTRs of C. elegans transcripts tend
to be relatively short [17] and typically the entire intergenic region was targeted. Where the intergenic region is
less than 300 bp, a 300 bp fragment extending into the
coding region of the upstream gene was cloned. Where the
intergenic region is more than 2000 bp, the 2000 bp
immediately upstream of the translational initiation
codon was targeted. Where initial cloning was unsuccessful, 1500 bp fragments were cloned instead.
Many (258) of the cloned promoters assayed here were
present in the original Promoterome library, Version 1.0
[8], which had not been specifically targeted at transcription factor genes. A subsequent large scale cloning exercise, directed at wTF2.0, yielded another 351 promoter
clones. In addition, a further 31 promoters were cloned
specifically to identify overlaps in expression domains
that could reveal potential functional overlap among transcription factor family members: both synergistic functional overlap, e.g. among families of transcription factors
known to heterodimerise (bHLH, homeodomain, paired
domain) and redundant functional overlap.
Promoterome clones were used to generate promoter::gfp
fusions by Gateway recombination. Although some transformation by microinjection was performed (20 genes),
plasmids bearing the fusions were mostly used in transformation of C. elegans by microprojectile bombardment
(350 genes, 4 by both techniques) [see additional file 1].
High-throughput microprojectile bombardment requires
a continuous supply of unc-119 mutant C. elegans, on a
large scale, and for this we devised a cyclical liquid media
protocol. For each reporter fusion, up to eight independent transgenic lines were created. For each line, the rate of
transmission of the transgene, both meiotically, between
generations, and mitotically, during development of individual animals, and the level and pattern of GFP expression were assessed. Unlike microinjection, bombardment
frequently results in transformed lines that have the transgene stably integrated into the genome. Approximately
one in every eight lines generated in this study appeared
to have the introduced DNA chromosomally integrated,
less than the 25% rate reported by others [16]. Typically,
after the GFP expression pattern was documented, three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/27

transgenic strains were retained for each promoterreporter fusion and are available for further studies.
The GFP expression patterns driven by Promoterome
inserts for 366 C. elegans transcription factor genes have
been determined. Attention was concentrated on the
smaller transcription factor families, such as homeodomain and bHLH proteins. More than 2500 independent
transgenic lines were generated and examined, and over
1000 of these have been retained for future use.
Expression pattern characterization
In each transgenic line established, the GFP expression
pattern was observed in intact hermaphrodites from a
mixed age population with worms of all developmental
stages. Complete transparency throughout this animal's
development means that GFP can be readily observed in
any cell in whole mounts. Thousands of individuals were
given a cursory examination with a few individuals studied more carefully, and at higher magnification. Each
expression pattern was determined with respect to early,
mid and late embryogenesis, through early, mid and late
larval stages to fully developed adult. Depending on the
nature of the pattern, expression was determined to tissue
type or down to the specific cells [See additional file 1].
Illustrative micrographs of each expression pattern, along
with text descriptions, were entered into a web-accessible
database [18].

For any given reporter gene fusion, the same expression
pattern was observed consistently in all independent
transgenic lines that showed GFP expression, whether
generated by microinjection or bombardment. Expression
intensity did vary considerably between lines generated by
bombardment, more than seen with transformation by
microinjection, and this is presumably the reason why
expression was not detected in all lines for functional
fusions, particularly for those with weak promoters. Nevertheless, for most reporter gene fusions assayed that
drove GFP expression, almost all or all lines showed
expression. The expression pattern was not accepted as
genuine unless that expression pattern was seen in at least
two independent lines. Lines with the transforming DNA
integrated into a chromosome (by non-homologous
insertion) typically had lower expression levels, presumably due to the lower copy-number of the reporter fusion
[16], but complete expression patterns were then seen in
all individuals at the appropriate stage of development. In
lines with the transforming DNA present in extrachromosomal arrays, and not integrated into a chromosome,
expression could be very strong. Extrachromosomal arrays
generated by microinjection contain hundreds of copies
of the reporter fusion gene [10] but copy number was not
determined for any of the lines generated here. Extrachromosomal arrays are not reliably transmitted to all cells

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/27

during an individual's development or to all an individual's progeny, so not all individuals in populations of
such lines contain the transgene and each individual that
does is a mosaic of cells with and without the transgene.
For these mosaic lines, therefore, a larger number of animals were examined closely so that each component of
the expression pattern was observed and the complete
expression pattern could be appreciated. Interestingly, in
comparison to the corresponding extrachromosomal
array lines, no extraneous expression was observed in any
of the 135 chromosomally integrated lines suggesting that
the position of insertion into the genome had no effect on
reporter expression. This would be consistent with the
apparently tight organization of genetic units in C. elegans,
but it is still remarkable that no examples of such influence were observed in such a large number of integration
events. Within any given expression pattern, expression
intensity varies among tissues. While this observation
may be due to some cell types being larger or more obvious than others (e.g. excretory cell versus a single neuron),
this will also reflect differences in the endogenous cellspecific activity of the promoter between cells.
A summary of the expression pattern data gathered in this
study is provided in Table 1. GFP expression was
observed, in hermaphrodites under standard laboratory
conditions, for 92% (335 of 366) of the promoter reporter
gene fusions assayed. The 31 Promoterome inserts that
failed to drive GFP expression may be from inactive genes,
may contain promoters with activity that is male-specific,
only induced under specific environmental conditions, or
too weak to be observed by the method followed, or the
gene model used in selecting the promoter region may be
wrong. Three of these Promoterome inserts are from
downstream genes in operons, so the expression of these

genes appears totally dependent upon promoters of
upstream genes in the operon, that were not within the
DNA fragment assayed.
Most of the expression patterns driven by the C. elegans
transcription factor gene promoters assayed showed a
restricted distribution with only 31 (8%) of the reporter
gene fusions driving GFP expression constitutively. Every
C. elegans tissue-type was represented amongst the
restricted GFP expression patterns with the exception of
the germ line. Germ line expression is generally only seen
in transgenic lines of C. elegans in which the transforming
DNA is chromosomally integrated [19] and such a line
has not been generated for all the promoter reporter
fusion genes assayed. However, few transcription factors,
sequence specific DNA binding proteins that typically regulate transcription of target genes to control development
or tissue specific responses to environmental conditions,
would be expected to be expressed either in the germ line
or constitutively.
The majority of C. elegans transcription factor promoter
fragments assayed in this study drive reporter expression
in the nervous system (246 promoters, 67%). The nervous
system constitutes 302 of the 959 somatic cells in the
adult hermaphrodite and 118 nerve cell classes can be distinguished anatomically [20]. Transcription factors are
expected to have a major role in determining cell identities within this complex tissue and, through evolution,
many transcription factors involved in other aspects of
development would have been recruited to distinguish or
modify nerve cell fates. Over half of the somatic cells and
almost all the tissue types in C. elegans are generated during embryogenesis and so it is not surprising that 82%
(299) of the promoter reporter fusions are active during

embryonic stages of development. These general statistics
are entirely consistent with expectations, if the Promoterome inserts are indeed providing an accurate reflection of
the expression of the endogenous genes.
Reliability of reporter expression pattern data
Expression patterns based on typical C. elegans reporter
fusions are subject to the caveat of whether DNA segments
fused to the reporter contain all the elements required to
fully replicate the distribution of the endogenous gene
product. Even for complex reporter fusions, when the
reporter gene is inserted into a cloned DNA fragment
maintaining all in the vicinity of the target gene, a more
distantly located element could always exist that is essential for the correct pattern of transcription [21]. Simple
reporter fusions, made using only the upstream region,
will, of course, lack all post-transcriptional aspects of regulation, such as that mediated by microRNAs, but may
also lack transcriptional regulatory elements located in
introns, in exons or downstream of the target gene. The
compactness of the C. elegans genome [3], however, may
make it more likely than for some other animals that a
DNA fragment from immediately upstream of the protein-coding region will contain the promoter and most or
even all of the required transcriptional control elements.

For some C. elegans transcription factor genes, intergenic
DNA fragments of the size cloned in the Promoterome
resource [8], 1.5 to 2.0 kb, are enough to drive the complete endogenous expression pattern. For example, deletion studies using the promoters of ceh-16 [22] and ceh-22
[23] revealed that only 1 kb and 1.9 kb of upstream
region, respectively, is required for reporter gene expression to match the pattern revealed using a specific antibody to the gene product. However, for other genes such
small upstream regions are not sufficient: egl-5 needs 8 kb
of upstream region plus elements downstream from the
start of the protein coding region [24] and lin-39 needs
10.5 kb of upstream region plus the first intron, although
the region downstream of the protein coding region
appears dispensable [25].
To assess the reliability of expression patterns driven by
Promoterome inserts we compared our data to published
expression patterns generated by either immunofluorescence microscopy or in situ hybridization [See additional
file 2] which reveal gene product, protein or mRNA, distributions directly. Such data exist for 40 of the 366 C. elegans transcription factors we assayed. Comparing these
datasets is not straightforward because the expression pattern descriptions can be taken to different resolutions by
the different methods. Furthermore, the descriptions are
referring to different aspects of the expression pattern:
Promoterome reporter gene fusions display transcriptional activity while transcript or protein distributions are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/27

subject to post-transcriptional events such as stability differences and protein trafficking. Nevertheless, nearly half
of the Promoterome-driven expression patterns (17 of 40)
appeared to recapitulate the published expression descriptions indicating that these fragments contain all the regulatory elements required to direct the endogenous
transcription pattern. Almost all the remainder (19 of 23)
appeared to include expression domains contained within
the published descriptions, suggesting that the reporter
pattern was incomplete but that the Promoterome insert
assayed was accurately driving at least one component of
the endogenous gene's expression and contains all the regulatory elements essential for this component. Obviously,
a missing component in the expression pattern could be
because the DNA fragment assayed in the reporter fusion
is missing a binding site for a transcriptional activator of
relevance to the promoter's activity. However, a non-misleading reason for an incomplete pattern for the reporter
fusion is that only one Promoterome insert was assayed
for each gene and alternative promoters could drive
expression of the missing components. Five of these Promoterome clones do indeed target genes already known
to have alternate start codons.
Only four of the forty Promoterome driven expression
patterns used in the comparison showed no overlap with
the antibody or mRNA in situ data. For three of these the
previous data concerned expression in the germ line (or
the very early embryo, which is typically derived from
transcripts present in the germ line) and the difficulty of
driving reporter expression in the germ line is well known
[19]. Germ line expression of reporters appears favoured
by chromosomal integration of fusion genes and no chromosomally integrated lines were generated for Promoterome fusions for one of these genes, mep-1. The total lack
of detectable reporter expression in the chromosomallyintegrated lines that were generated for Promoterome
fusions for the other two genes, mex-5 and oma-2, not even
revealing the expression seen in the corresponding extrachromosomal array bearing lines, may mean that expression in these integrated lines was accurately reflecting the
endogenous promoter activity but the low copy number
and feeble promoters made this expression too weak to be
observed. For unc-86, the fourth gene for which the Promoterome expression pattern showed no overlap with the
immunomicroscopy or mRNA in situ data, there was simply no reporter expression observed. However, the predicted translation initiation codon, as presented in
WormBase and used in design of the Promoterome insert,
does not correspond with the start of the protein coding
region implied by EST data or gene prediction programmes, and therefore the unc-86 promoter had probably not been fused properly to the reporter.

Most of the Promoterome driven expression patterns (33
of 40) did include additional components in comparison
to the immunofluorescence microscopy or in situ hybridization data but this is not as misleading as the statistics
might suggest. The most obvious reason explaining these
extra domains would be that the Promoterome insert
lacks regulatory elements that are required for binding of
transcription factors needed to silence expression otherwise driven in these domains by transcriptional activators
that bind to the promoter region. However, a complication with reporter-based assays in C. elegans is the anecdotal evidence that vectors used for reporter fusions contain
cryptic enhancer elements that can drive spurious expression, for example in the pharynx [26] or posterior intestine [27]. Artifactual pharyngeal expression may be
revealed when C. elegans promoters are subject to deletion
analysis, as for example with the ges-1 promoter [28]. Posterior intestine expression has been linked to the unc-54
3'UTR commonly used for transcript stability in C. elegans
reporter constructs [27]. All the promoters assayed in this
study were cloned into the same Gateway GFP-reporter
destination vector, which does include the unc-54 3'UTR.
C. elegans transformed with an empty Gateway GFPreporter vector, lacking an insert, display no GFP expression, despite there still being DNA, vector DNA, upstream
from the reporter. This reveals the need for a DNA fragment with at least basal promoter activity even for spurious expression of the reporter. However, many of the
promoter::GFP fusions we assayed drove expression in the
posterior intestine, pharynx and anterior head muscles
(and less-frequently other body wall muscles) that we
speculate may be artifactual. While this expression cannot
be simply dismissed, as some genes will be expressed in
these tissues, these components in the descriptions must
be considered as potentially irrelevant to the endogenous
gene's promoter activity. Such artifacts are more obvious
when assaying very large numbers of promoters in the
same vector, but mean caution must be exercised when C.
elegans genes are studied individually with reporter technology.
If the trends observed in this comparison with prior data
were applicable to C. elegans genes more generally,
beyond our selected set of transcription factor genes, then
90% of Promoterome inserts will drive expression in
endogenously significant domains, with almost half fully
replicating the complete expression pattern. The Promoterome would then be a particularly valuable resource
for investigating C. elegans promoter activity, especially
for identifying DNA elements required for specific expression pattern components and the transcription factors
that bind them [8]. Of course, other techniques for examining gene expression patterns may not report accurately
on a promoter's transcriptional activity because of the
influence of posttranscriptional events.

Insights into the C. elegans Six family of transcription
factors
The Six homeodomain protein family is one of the families of C. elegans transcription factors for which all the Promoterome reporter expression pattern data were
determined. A deeper consideration of our data for these
particular genes illustrates some of the points about reliability of the data discussed more generally above.

The Six homeodomain family members are defined by
homology with sine oculis from Drosophila melanogaster
(reviewed in [29]). These proteins possess a Six domain in
addition to an homeodomain, both of which are essential
for specific interactions both with other proteins and with
DNA. Six-type proteins have been identified in species
across the Metazoa, from ctenophores, cnidarians and
sponges to mammals [30]. The Six family is divided into
three subfamilies based on sequence similarity, Six1/2,
Six3/6 and Six4/5, with genome comparisons suggesting
that the last common bilaterian ancestor had a representative of all three subfamilies. Six family members are best
known for their roles in eye development but appear to
function in the formation of multiple head structures.
Xenopus laevis, Drosophila melanogaster and mouse Six-type
genes are expressed in developing anterior regions that
become sensory, nervous and muscle tissue. Six family
genes are also expressed in several domains outside of the
head, including the gonad, stomach, and kidney and
appear to play a more general role in myogenesis throughout the body axis.
C. elegans has four Six-type genes: ceh-32, ceh-33, ceh-34,
and unc-39, all on chromosome V. ceh-33 and ceh-34 are
adjacent to each other but appear to be the products of an
ancient gene duplication because this genomic organization is conserved in both Caenorhabditis briggsae and
Caenorhabditis remanei. Sequence comparison places ceh33 and ceh-34 in the Six1/2 subfamily and ceh-32 in the
Six3/6 subfamily. While unc-39 appears only distantly
related to other Six4/5 proteins [31], the Six domain and
homeodomain of human Six5 can functionally substitute
for those of UNC-39 in C. elegans mutant rescue assays
[32], strongly supporting a place for unc-39 in the Six4/5
subfamily.
The Promoterome clone for ceh-32 contains the 1500 bp,
of the 4 kb intergenic region, immediately upstream of the
start codon. The GFP expression driven by this DNA fragment begins in anterior regions of the early embryo and
continues through the comma stage when additional cells
in the posterior start to express. The number of expressing
cells then decreases until, in late embryos and all posthatching stages, expression was seen only in one pair of
head nerves (Figure 1A,B,C). The cytoplasmic localization
of the GFP reveals the processes of these nerves extending

Page 6 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:27

ventrally to the tail, identifying these cells as one of six
pairs of the AV interneurons which have very similar morphology. The expression of ceh-32 has previously been
studied using immunostaining with a specific antibody
and by creating transgenic animals expressing a functional
ceh-32::gfp fusion [31]. Antibody staining was described as
detecting CEH-32 protein in anterior regions of the gastrulating embryo and subsequent stages of embryogenesis,
plus in head hypodermal cells, 24 head nerves and the
somatic gonad, postembryonically. The DNA fragment
fused to gfp in the prior work [31] was significantly different from that for ceh-32 in the Promoterome as it included
all the exons, introns and 3.8 kb of the upstream intergenic region such that GFP was at the C-terminus of CEH32 in the fusion protein encoded. Nematodes transformed using this larger reporter gene fusion were
described as showing GFP expression in a pattern similar
to that observed using the anti-CEH-32 antibody during
embryogenesis and in the somatic gonad postembryonically, but with reporter expression in only a subset of the
head nerves and very weak expression in head hypodermal cells. The Promoterome reporter fusion appears to
have accurately revealed part of the ceh-32 expression pattern and gives no additional components: expression is
seen in the anterior of the early embryo and remains in
two nerve cells. Driving expression of unfused GFP, as
when using the Promoterome inserts, reveals cell morphology, of value in nerve cell identification, that is lost in
the nuclear-localized signal observed with the CEH32::GFP fusion protein and anti-CEH32 antibody. The
lack of somatic gonad expression probably reflects the
absence, from the Promoterome insert, of regulatory elements needed for this expression component. There may
be a similar explanation for the lack of expression in more
nerve cells and in the anterior hypodermis. However, the
missing elements in this case could simply be those
required to maintain the expression that is present in the
precursors of these cells in the early embryo. Alternatively
free GFP may not be appropriately stabilized in these cells,
like the CEH-32 or CEH-32::GFP might be, by interactions
with other proteins and/or nuclear-localization.
The ceh-33 Promoterome insert consists of the entire 370
bp upstream intergenic region and drove strong GFP
expression in the most anterior body wall muscles from
late embryogenesis to adulthood (Figure 1E). The ceh34::gfp fusion generated from the Promoterome included
just 2 kb of the 3.9 kb intergenic region, from immediately
upstream of the translation initiation codon, and gave
strong expression in body wall muscle cells in the head
and tail from late embryogenesis to adulthood (Figure
1F). GFP fusions, generated for both ceh-33 and ceh-34
using the PCR-stitching method, have been assayed previously [33]. For ceh-33, gfp was fused to the fourth exon (of
six) and the fusion gene contained 7 kb of DNA upstream

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/27

of the translation initiation codon, including two unrelated genes. For ceh-34, gfp was also fused to the fourth
exon (again of six), but this fusion contained simply the
entire 3.9 kb upstream intergenic region. Nematodes
transformed with either of these fusion genes only
showed weak pharyngeal reporter expression, which has
been thought to be a common artifactual reporter expression domain (see above) and is in contrast to the strong,
specific reporter expression driven by the ceh-33 and ceh34 Promoterome inserts. Note that expression in the very
anterior body wall muscle cells, like that driven by the ceh33 Promoterome insert only much weaker, was seen unexpectedly often during the reporter expression analysis of
the Promoterome and so is identified as a potential background artifact of the particular vector arrangement used
here. Furthermore, the ceh-33 upstream intergenic region
is very small, even for C. elegans, and although the immediately upstream and tandemly-arranged gene, C10G8.8,
is not thought to be organized together with ceh-33 in an
operon, additional regulatory elements directing ceh-33
expression, upstream of the intergenic region, could have
been anticipated. However, in contrast to other reporter
vectors, aspects of the vector arrangement used in the Promoterome analysis could have made reporter expression
in these anterior body wall muscles feasible, allowing the
real expression pattern of ceh-33 to be revealed. This interpretation is supported by the strength of the Promoterome ceh-33::gfp expression and the striking relatedness to
the distinct expression pattern for the closely related gene
ceh-34.
The unc-39 Promoterome insert is 1500 bp of the 7 kb
intergenic region and drove GFP expression in the anterior
of early and mid-stage embryos, and in a pair of amphids
and a pair of interneurons in the head of late embryos and
all postembryonic stages (Figure 1G). This expression pattern matches that observed previously, "embryonic
expression" and "head neurons in larvae and adults" [34],
for a larger, 2899 bp, DNA fragment from the unc-39
upstream region fused to gfp by the PCR stitching method.
The expression of unc-39 was also previously analysed
with an unc-39::gfp fusion [32] that had been shown to
functionally complement unc-39 mutations. The gfp
reporter was inserted at the end of the unc-39 protein-coding region within a DNA fragment containing the entire
unc-39 locus, from 4.4 kb upstream of the translation initiation codon to the end of the transcribed region. This
fusion gene was described as expressing GFP in anterior
regions of the gastrulating embryo expanding with cell
divisions to comma-stage embryos when some expressing
cells, including Z1 and Z4 (the founders of the somatic
gonad), M (the postembryonic mesoblast) and the coelomocytes [32], migrate posteriorly. In later embryos and L1
larvae GFP was restricted to ten anterior cells (mostly
nerves) and the somatic gonad, with no GFP detected in

later postembryonic stages. This expression pattern
matched unc-39 mutant phenotypes which suggested
roles in the development of mesodermal lineages (coelomocytes, muscles, somatic gonad) and anterior neurons
(amphids, interneurons, CANs), particularly in anterior to
posterior cell migration and axon guidance. Thus, both
the promoter::reporter fusions and the gfp insertion into
the gene gave similar expression patterns with one exception being that GFP of the former remained through the
postembryonic stages. This difference could simply reflect
decreased protein stability conferred on GFP by UNC-39,
rather than a difference in transcription, as GFP expressed
from a reporter gene fusion with the same 4.4 kb
upstream region and the unc-39 3'UTR but with just the
GFP ORF, also remained to adulthood [32]. The expression driven by the shorter promoter::reporter fusions also
appears incomplete, these DNA fragments possibly lacking elements required for expression in the somatic
gonad, body wall muscles and additional nerve cells.
Comparing GFP expression patterns driven by Promoterome inserts for all four C. elegans Six-type genes, to each
other and with prior data, provides insight into both the
functional organization of each locus and the evolution of
this gene family. This example illustrates the value of the
Promoterome resource and of the reporter expression pattern data.
High expression pattern success rate and low gene
duplication rate for transcription factor genes
Promoters were found to drive GFP expression for all four
Six gene family members. It is notable that, in this study,
a much higher proportion of reporter gene fusions yielded
detectable GFP expression than in two previous large-scale
experiments [35,36] utilizing reporters to examine C. elegans gene expression (92% compared to approximately
50%). There are many differences between the approaches
used that could account for the different success rates.
Genes were more likely to be targeted for inclusion in the
Promoterome if they had had transcripts identified previously, the point of fusion being placed within the region
known to be transcribed, and so there was already experimental evidence suggesting that most of the DNA fragments assayed here were likely to drive reporter
expression. Other technical differences included the use of
different reporter gene vectors and transformation of C.
elegans by microprojectile bombardment rather than
microinjection. Nevertheless, in a parallel study, using
exactly the same approach as followed here, GFP expression was observed for only 42 of 58 (72%) Promoterome
inserts for a set of non-transcription factor genes (J. Shingles and I. Hope, unpublished) suggesting the high success might, at least in part, relate to the focus on
transcription factor genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/27

C. elegans transcription factor genes might have qualities
that mean their promoter regions are more likely to drive
reporter expression. In one of the previous large-scale
reporter studies [36], a major factor suggested for the low
success rate for the assays was a high proportion of pseudogenes amongst the genes identified in the annotation of
the C. elegans genome. These defective genes are a byproduct of the high rates of local gene duplication, that
appear to occur in the C. elegans genome [37], followed by
genetic drift. If transcription factor genes were relatively
resistant, on an evolutionary scale, to local duplication,
there would be a paucity of defective transcription factor
genes in the C. elegans genome, leading to a higher rate of
success in reporter assays.
Therefore, to explore the extent of transcription factor
gene duplication, the transcription factor genes of C. elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae were compared. C. elegans
and C. briggsae diverged approximately 100 million years
ago [38] and the genome sequence for both has been carefully annotated, so genes duplicated since divergence of
the species and retained can be readily determined. A
likely C. briggsae orthologue was sought for each gene in
the compendium of C. elegans transcription factor genes
we generated recently [15]. The primary aim of the analysis was to identify C. elegans genes that were likely to have
arisen by duplication on the lineage to C. elegans and
therefore a table of the closest C. briggsae orthologue, for
each C. elegans transcription factor gene, matched to its
closest C. elegans gene was generated [See additional file
3]. Where a C. elegans transcription factor gene lacks a C.
briggsae orthologue that gene is likely to have arisen
through local duplication. The alternative explanation,
that the C. briggsae orthologue has been lost, was typically
rendered even less likely when the molecular phylogenetic
relationships within a family were evaluated.
For many transcription factor gene families there was an
exact, or close to exact, one to one match between C. elegans and C. briggsae orthologues (Table 2). This is in sharp
contrast to the approximately 65% of genes genome-wide
that can be placed in orthologous pairs in comparisons
between these two species [38]. A molecular phylogeny
for the NK class of homeodomain containing transcription factors (Figure 2A), one of the families with a perfect
correspondence between C. elegans and C. briggsae orthologues, reveals the strength of confidence in the orthologies.
For some transcription factor gene families a few exceptions to the perfect orthologue correspondence were
found which probably do not actually correspond to
duplication of transcription factor gene function. The
forkhead transcription factor gene family molecular phylogeny (Figure 2B) reveals one C. briggsae gene and three C.

elegans genes lacking an orthologue in the sister species.
The C. briggsae gene CBG05575 has resulted from a tandem duplication of CBG05577, the orthologue of the C.
elegans forkhead gene F38A6.1 (pha-4), but is probably a
defective copy. There is a stop codon and a frameshift in
the region of CBG05575 encoding the forkhead DNA
binding domain that would prevent production of a functional transcription factor. The increased sequence divergence for this pseudogene, as a result of relaxation of
selection, along with the problem of gene structure prediction, has meant that the branch leading to CBG05575 in
the molecular phylogeny appears misleadingly much
deeper than it probably should be. The three C. elegans
genes that lack C. briggsae orthologues, C29F7.4 (fkh-3),

C29F7.5 (fkh-4) and F26A1.2 (fkh-5), are all related to
each other, the former two being a tandem gene pair
resulting from a very recent single gene duplication event.
The length of the branches in the molecular phylogeny
leading to these three genes are also longer than for any
other members of this gene family suggesting relaxation
of selection as a result of loss (or change) of function. Furthermore, promoters for these three genes drove reporter
expression in all somatic cells in the early embryo [39], an
odd expression pattern for a transcription factor that is
expected to function in distinguishing between developmental cell fates. These observations could suggest that
these three C. elegans forkhead genes may no longer
encode functional regulatory transcription factors.

A few transcription factor gene families, however, showed
a marked low proportion of clear orthology between C.
elegans and C. briggsae members (Table 2). The CUT class
of homeodomain containing transcription factors (Figure
2C) and the T-box family (Figure 2D) are clear examples
of where genes have undergone repeated duplications
since the divergence of C. elegans and C. briggsae. This
reduces confidence in the orthologies that have been
assigned and the level of full functional correspondence
between genes of these families in the two species may be
even lower than presented. Three of the four C. elegans
CUT homeodomain encoding genes that lack a C. briggsae
orthologue result from the tandem amplification of one
gene and are more closely related to each other [40] than
the molecular phylogenetic tree suggests. However, this
gene family has undergone extensive amplification in the
C. briggsae lineage. The T-box gene family has undergone
even more extensive duplications and in both the C. elegans and the C. briggsae lineage. Therefore, while on average transcription factor genes show a lower frequency of
gene duplication for these Caenorhabditis species, as noted
for other organisms [41], this is not true for all transcription factor gene families.

Conclusion
The Promoterome resource was generated as an important
experimental subject through which an understanding of
the control of expression of the C. elegans genome can be
constructed [8]. The Promoterome is a characterized bank
of clones of the regions immediately upstream of the start
of C. elegans genes, regions containing the highest density
of the cis-acting elements that control gene expression.
Results from assays of different aspects of promoter activity can be directly related to each other when the assays
have been applied to identical DNA fragments, as cloned
in the Promoterome. Approaches, such as the yeast onehybrid assay, will reveal transcription factors which can
bind to each promoter [14,42]. To relate this to promoter
function in vivo the pattern of expression driven by these
DNA fragments needs to be determined and this can be
revealed directly in C. elegans strains generated by transformation with Promoterome inserts fused to reporter
genes, as described here. These data will be essential for
construction of computer simulations representing how
transcription of the entire genome is coordinated. We
have focused initially on promoters of transcription factor
genes as these will be at the heart of such models. A final
set of data, essential for construction of these models and
complementary to the other data sets, is the distribution
of the transcription factors themselves and approaches to
deliver these data, that can be scaled up, are now being
developed [9]. Further technical advances, to allow automatic determination of in vivo distributions of transcription factors and promoter activity, to single cell
resolution, on a large scale [43], will also be crucial.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/27

Transcriptional control elements are not found exclusively in the region immediately upstream of the start of a
eukaryotic gene and therefore Promoterome inserts will
not contain all transcription factor binding sites of relevance to every gene's expression. Furthermore, in the
transgenic C. elegans strains generated the reporter gene
fusions are not in their natural context. Therefore, we have
evaluated how accurately the expression patterns driven
by Promoterome inserts report on the transcriptional
activity of a gene's promoter by comparing our expression
patterns with those reported by others examining gene
product distributions by immunofluorescence microscopy or in situ hybridisation.
With the experience of examining hundreds of reporter
gene expression patterns in C. elegans, the Promoterome
inserts provide a reliable report on a gene's transcriptional
activity. Subtle differences in timing between previously
described gene product distributions and the promoter::reporter fusion gene expression pattern can be
ascribed simply to posttranscriptional events and are not
an issue. Certain expression pattern components, seen
with more reporter fusion genes than expected based on
other expression pattern data and which may result from
cryptic enhancers in the cloning vector only revealed
according to properties of the particular promoter being
assayed, do need to be treated with scepticism but are
readily recognised in large scale studies. For some promoter::reporter fusion genes components of complex
expression patterns appear to be missing, but this may be
due, although clearly not in all cases, to a gene having
alternative promoters, the expression observed accurately
reflecting the transcriptional activity of the promoter
assayed. Once the repeatedly-seen, background expression pattern components are dismissed, 90% of the
expression pattern data generated with Promoterome
reporter fusion genes is reporting accurately on transcriptional activity of C. elegans gene promoters.
The C. elegans Six family is one of the families of transcription factor genes for which we have generated expression
pattern data for all members, using the Promoterome
resource. These genes' expression patterns appear related
to those observed for Six-type genes in other animals: sensory, nervous and muscle structures of the head, as well as
gonad tissues and other muscles outside the head. This
suggests that the roles played by genes of the Six family in
flies, frogs and mammals are shared by nematodes. The
strong and specific expression for the promoters of the
adjacent Six family genes ceh-33 and ceh-34, reveals overlapping expression in head muscles for a gene pair that
has been retained in all species of the Caenorhabditis genus
for which the genome has been sequenced. There is no
obvious similarity in nucleotide sequence between the
Promoterome inserts of these two genes, but degeneracy

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:27

and small size of transcription factor binding sites means
that the overlap in their expression patterns could still be
driven by the same transcriptional control system. Retention of these two genes, and presumably the overlap in
their expression patterns, over considerable evolutionary
time suggests important functions for both in the very
anterior head muscles. Although specific knockdown of
ceh-33 and ceh-34 individually, by RNAi, generated no
obvious phenotype [4], closer attention to movement of
the tip of the head in single and double knockdown experiments may reveal synergistic or overlapping function for
these two genes. The more extensive expression of ceh-34
in the head as well as in the tail suggests a unique function
for this gene in additional muscle cells that may also be
revealed by closer inspection of C. elegans subject to ceh34 RNAi. All body wall muscle cells appear very similar
morphologically and there is no information yet on how
or why the very anterior and posterior body wall muscle
cells are distinguished from more central body wall muscle cells.
The tandem gene pair of ceh-33 and ceh-34 appears to be
one example of the relatively rare event of a transcription
factor gene that has been locally duplicated with both
copies retaining function. The study of transcription factor
gene duplication through identification of orthologues
between C. elegans and C. briggsae was initiated because of
the high rate of success of reporter gene expression for
Promoterome inserts assayed here. In a previous study
using the reporter approach [36] the poor success rate specifically for recently duplicated genes had led to the suggestion that there were many pseudogenes amongst the
annotated C. elegans genes. This large number of nonprocessed pseudogenes would be a consequence of a high
local gene duplication rate within the C. elegans genome,
with subsequent drift of extra gene copies. In contrast,
observation of GFP expression of reporter fusions for
almost all transcription factor gene promoters would suggest there are few pseudogenes, as a consequence of low
local duplication events, specifically for this type of gene.
Subsequent evidence further supports there being an
abundance of dysfunctional genes in the C. elegans
genome. High rates of gene duplication, with genetic drift
of duplicated genes, may be a consequence of reproduction principally by self-fertilization. Over a thousand
pseudogenes are now specifically annotated as such in
WormBase [44]. In a large scale RNAi study [4], recently
duplicated genes yielded detectable phenotypes less frequently than other genes and, although interpreted in
terms of overlapping function for recently duplicated
genes, this would also be consistent with many recently
duplicated genes no longer retaining any function. Nonsense-mediated decay of non-coding transcripts could
mean that there is less pressure on dysfunctional genes to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/27

be deleted from the genome and so pseudogenes may
remain longer, thereby accumulating in a genome in
larger numbers than might have been expected [45].
Genes involved in interacting with C. elegans' natural environment appear to undergo frequent duplication events,
driven by their ecological interactions, and such gene families are consequently large, showing relatively high rates
of gene birth and death [46]. There are many members of
these gene families inactivated by mutation in the
researcher-defined wild-type strain, N2, while functional
in other, independently-isolated wild-type strains and,
therefore, the species [46]. Such genes, although included
within the large proportion of the genome identified as
dysfunctional and therefore pseudogenic in an earlier
study [36], should not be designated as pseudogenes [46].
Transcription factor genes, in general, appear excluded
from this high rate of local gene duplication within the C.
elegans genome. Similar observations were made for Arabidopsis thaliana [41]. In this plant, in addition to a high
rate of local gene duplication like C. elegans, the genome
has undergone three recognizable whole genome duplication events revealing that transcription factor genes have
duplicated specifically through the latter rather than the
former mechanism. Furthermore, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes that decreased fitness when over-expressed were
enriched for transcription factor genes [47]. For many of
the C. elegans transcription factor gene families, the high
confidence in and completeness of C. elegans/C. briggsae
orthologies (and beyond (data not shown)) suggests these
gene families have been fixed in extent for far longer than
the time since the C. elegans/C. briggsae divergence. Given
the multiplicity of many transcription factor genes' roles,
with distinct gene expression domains, it might have been
anticipated that such genes would be the ideal subjects for
local gene duplication, with rapid sub-functionalization
of the duplicated copies. However, transcription factor
genes, that have been duplicated, can retain overlapping
function over an evolutionary time-scale [48]. Perhaps the
complexity of transcription factor gene expression patterns, matched by the complexity of their transcriptional
control with elements for different expression domains
tightly intermingled, means that simultaneous separation
of different functions during gene duplication is impossible. Although experimental evidence, for example from
chromosomal rearrangements, suggests extra copies of
transcription factor genes in general are not deleterious in
C. elegans our observations suggest that on an evolutionary scale the function of these genes is exquisitely sensitive
to dosage.
However, it would be wrong to suggest that all transcription factor genes are resistant to local gene duplication. In
fact, the high success rate for reporter gene expression that
initially led to this consideration in part reflects which

Page 13 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:27

transcription factor gene families we focused on. A few
transcription factor gene families show relatively high
rates of gene duplication since the C. elegans/C. briggsae
divergence. The nuclear hormone receptor transcription
factor gene family is very large with just 55% of C. elegans
genes having C. briggsae orthologues. These qualities,
along with the steroid binding domain for sensing levels
of hydrophobic compounds, would be consistent with
many members of this family being involved in environmental sensing and gene duplication in this gene family
being driven by ecological interactions. Most transcription factor gene families are involved in directing development. As C. elegans development is largely invariant and
does not change substantially with the environment, ecological factors would not drive duplication of members of
such transcription factor gene families. The CUT homeodomain and the T-box transcription factor families have
the lowest level of C. elegans/C. briggsae orthology. Curiously, the Drosophila melanogaster cut gene, the founding
member of the CUT family, is involved in external sensory
organ development [49] and so perhaps duplication
within this transcription factor family is also driven by
ecological interactions. Several of the Promoterome
inserts for C. elegans CUT family members drove reporter
expression in sensory nerve cells. Members of the C. elegans CUT and T-box transcription factor gene families do
not appear as sensitive to increased gene dosage resulting
from local duplication as members of other transcription
factor gene families.

mals. Both the initial cloning and fusion generation steps
were performed in 96-well plates. Initial confirmation of
each clone was by PCR with vector-specific primers. To
ensure each Promoterome insert was correct, before C. elegans transformation, every fusion underwent either diagnostic restriction enzyme digests and/or DNA sequencing.

Methods

Transformation of C. elegans by microprojectile
bombardment
Procedures for transformation by bombardment were
developed from a protocol, provided by R. Andrews and J.
Ahringer (personal communication), derived from [16].
Large scale cultures of C. elegans strain DP38 (unc-119
(ed3)) were used for transformation by bombardment.
Nematodes from five, 5 cm NGM agar plates, were washed
into a flask containing 100 ml S-basal (0.1 M NaCl, 0.05
M Potassium Phosphate pH6, 5 μg/ml cholesterol (from a
5 mg/ml stock in ethanol)) supplemented with 50 μg/ml
Nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK.), 50 μg/ml Streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK.). An E. coli HB101 bacterial suspension was prepared, by centrifugation of a 1 litre overnight
culture grown in LB medium and resuspension of the cells
in 6 ml of S-basal, and 4 ml of this suspension was added
to each flask, one flask per plasmid. The nematode culture
was incubated, with shaking, at 20°C, for 7 days and then
transferred into large tubes for the nematodes to settle
out, at room temperature, under gravity over 10 minutes.
The supernatant was transferred to a separate tube and
allowed to settle a second time, but for 15 minutes and on
ice. Nematodes in the first pellet, mainly adults and L4s,
were used for bombardment immediately. Nematodes in
the second pellet, mainly young larvae, were used to inoculate a flask with a further 100 ml of S-basal plus antibiotics and bacteria. These secondary flasks were incubated
for three or four days, until the culture had almost cleared,
when nematodes were harvested as before. This protocol
allows continuous culture, providing nematodes suitable
for bombardment every 3 to 4 days. New cultures were
added and older cultures were removed on a weekly basis.

Generation of promoter::reporter fusions
Promoterome clones and promoter::gfp fusions were generated as previously described [8]. Briefly, Gateway-compatible primers designed to target regions upstream of C.
elegans ORFs were used in PCRs with C. elegans (wild-type
N2 strain) genomic DNA, with the resulting product
cloned into the MultiSite Gateway Entry vector pDONR
P4-P1R using BP clonase. The promoters were moved
from the Promoterome Entry clone to the MultiSite Destination vector pDEST-DD04 using LR clonase, such that
the translational start codon of the C. elegans gene would
lead into the appropriate translational reading frame of
the reporter. The reporter contains artificial introns and
the C. elegans unc-54 3'UTR to improve expression levels
in C. elegans. The vector also contains a wild-type C. elegans unc-119 gene to permit selection of transgenic ani-

Approximately 7 μg of each plasmid (Qiagen plasmid
DNA mini-preparation) was linearised by digestion with
NgoMIV, HindIII or BamHI restriction enzyme in standard
buffers (NEB) in a total reaction volume of 35 μl before
precipitation onto gold particles for bombardment. 60 mg
gold particles (0.3–3 μm, Chempur, Germany) were
added to 2 ml 70% ethanol, vortexed for 5 minutes,
allowed to soak for 15 minutes and then washed three
times with sterile water. The final gold pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile 50% glycerol. 30 μl of the plasmid digest was added directly to 70 μl of gold bead
suspension and vortexed for 1 minute. 300 μl of 2.5 M
CaCl2 was then added drop wise and while vortexing to
prevent sedimentation of the particles. 112 μl of 0.1 M
spermidine was then added in the same manner. Follow-

Work with the Promoterome resource has focussed initially on transcription factor genes anticipating that these
would form the base of any systems biology model of
genomic regulation. Transcription factor genes with C.
briggsae orthologues are more likely to be involved in
developmental control processes and hence to be at the
core of these models.

ing vortexing for 5 minutes, the suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 seconds and the supernatant
discarded. The gold beads were then washed in 800 μl
70% ethanol and finally resuspended in 70 μl 100% ethanol with continued vortexing until ready to use.
For each bombardment using the Bio-RadPDS-1000/He
with Hepta adapter, a 9 cm NGM agar plate seeded with
OP50, was inoculated with seven 150 μl aliquots of the
sedimented nematodes, placed in positions corresponding to the target of the Hepta adapter. The bombardment
procedure was then followed according to the manufacturers instructions. The inoculated NGM agar plate was
placed on the second target shelf up and 9.3 MPa (1350
psi) rupture disks were used with a vacuum of 91 kPa (26
in. Hg). Following bombardment, 1 ml of M9 buffer was
added to each plate and the nematodes were left to
recover for 1 hour at room temperature. Nematodes were
then washed from the plates with 4 ml M9 buffer and 0.5
ml of the nematode suspension was used to inoculate
each of seven seeded 9 cm NGM plates. All eight plates,
including the plate used in the bombardment, were incubated at 20°C for three weeks.
Plates were then examined for the presence of animals rescued for the unc-119 mutant phenotype, i.e. those having
survived starvation through their ability to form dauers
and showing wild-type movement. Four individuals from
each large plate were transferred individually to seeded 5
cm NGM agar plates. After 7 days the established lines
were assessed for level of transmission of the rescued phenotype and the transgene. The plate with the highest level
of transmission was retained and the remaining three
were discarded. Up to eight independent lines were generated per bombardment in this manner. Nematode lines
likely to contain integrated transgenes were identified
from the absence of unc-119 mutant progeny over several
generations.
Transformation by microinjection was as previously
described [10] with pRF4 and the plasmid containing the
GFP fusion injected as a mixture, both at 100 μg/ml, and
transformed lines established and maintained by screening for individuals with the roller phenotype.
Reporter expression pattern characterization
The target of eight independent transgenic nematode
lines, for each reporter gene fusion, was typically met and
all lines generated were examined for GFP expression.
Populations of hermaphrodites, at all stages of development, were examined by fluorescence microscopy with
Chroma Technology Corp. filter set 41012 on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with DIC optics. Spatial and
temporal GFP expression patterns were determined for
each transgenic nematode line, to the cellular level where

straightforward. Photomicrographs, representative of the
expression pattern observed, were collected with a Photometrics CoolSNAP camera and Improvision Openlab software. Data were incorporated into the Hope Laboratory
Expression Pattern Database [18]with details of the DNA
fragment assayed, a text description of the GFP expression
pattern, example images and further information about
each strain generated. Typically, three lines, those that
showed the highest level of transmission and/or GFP
expression, were retained, including any lines with the
introduced DNA chromosomally integrated. Frozen
stocks were prepared for each retained strain to provide a
permanent accessible resource for future reference.
Identification of transcription factor gene orthologues
C. briggsae genes [38] orthologous to C. elegans transcription factor genes [15] were extracted from WormBase
(freeze WS150) [44]and from downloaded Inparanoid
[50] data [51]. Blast analyses [52] were used to identify
additional family members in the C. briggsae genome
sequence data and to confirm or refine evolutionary relationships. Potential molecular phylogenies were generated using ClustalX version 1.8 [53] to align sequences
through the Neighbour-joining method with output of
unrooted trees for examination in Treeview PPC version
1.6 [54]. The analysis was only taken far enough to be
confident of relationships between C. elegans and C.
briggsae orthologues, and relationships implied by deeper
branches will be of lower significance.

Authors' contributions
JSRH and JS generated and interpreted the majority of the
reporter expression patterns and drafted the manuscript.
DD generated the Promoterome resource and the reporter
gene fusions. CAG and IAH generated and interpreted
some of the expression patterns. The deeper consideration
of the SIXHD data was carried out by JSRH. IAH carried
out the C. elegans/C. briggsae gene comparison. MV, AJMW
and IAH conceived, instigated and co-ordinated the
project. All authors contributed to, read and approved the
final manuscript.
