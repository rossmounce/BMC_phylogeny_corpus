Abstract
Background: The dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) is distributed along temperate, coastal
regions of New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and Peru where it feeds on schooling anchovy,
sardines, and other small fishes and squid tightly associated with temperate ocean sea surface
temperatures. Previous studies have suggested that the dusky dolphin dispersed in the Southern
Hemisphere eastward from Peru via a linear, temperate dispersal corridor provided by the
circumpolar west-wind drift. With new mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data, we
propose an alternative phylogeographic history for the dusky dolphin that was structured by
paleoceanographic conditions that repeatedly altered the distribution of its temperate prey species
during the Plio-Pleistocene.
Results: In contrast to the west-wind drift hypothesis, phylogenetic analyses support a Pacific/
Indian Ocean origin, with a relatively early and continued isolation of Peru from other regions.
Dispersal of the dusky dolphin into the Atlantic is correlated with the history of anchovy
populations, including multiple migrations from New Zealand to South Africa. Additionally, the
cooling of the Eastern Equatorial Pacific led to the divergence of anchovy populations, which in turn
explains the north-south equatorial transgression of L. obliquidens and the subsequent divergence
of L. obscurus in the Southern Hemisphere.
Conclusion: Overall, our study fails to support the west-wind drift hypothesis. Instead, our data
indicate that changes in primary productivity and related abundance of prey played a key role in
shaping the phylogeography of the dusky dolphin, with periods of ocean change coincident with
important events in the history of this temperate dolphin species. Moderate, short-term changes
in sea surface temperatures and current systems have a powerful effect on anchovy populations;
thus, it is not infeasible that repeated fluctuations in anchovy populations continue to play an
important role in the history of coastal dolphin populations.

Background
Over a 2.5 million year period in the Pleistocene repeated
patterns of expansion and recession of ice sheets from
Antarctica influenced globally the distribution of sea surface temperatures and the flow of ocean currents [1-3].
These historical geological events during the Plio-Pleistocene influenced contemporary patterns of genetic structure observed in marine organisms living in the Southern
Hemisphere [4-6]. For example, small-bodied dolphins of
the genera Cephalorhynchus and Lagenorynchus occupy
temperate waters in the Southern Hemisphere and share
similarities in their distribution and pattern of morphological and genetic (exclusively mtDNA) divergence that
have been interpreted as being the result of dispersal corridors present during inter-glacial periods in the PlioPleistocene [7,8]. These contemporary patterns of divergence and distribution observed for these genera of dolphin inspired the west-wind drift hypothesis, which
suggests an eastward dispersal of dolphins via a unidirectional, linear route with the temperate west-wind drift
ocean current present during the Plio-Pleistocene. The
west-wind drift hypothesis plus the preference for temperate waters purportedly explains the roughly concordant
distribution of these dolphins in temperate, upwelling
regions along coastal South Africa, South America, and
New Zealand within 8°C and 16°C isotherms (Figure 1).
As a result, the current ranges of these genera are large but
discontinuous, separated by vast expanses of ocean and
tropical waters between temperate regions.
Lagenorhynchus obscurus (the dusky dolphin) is the one of
the most widely distributed dolphin species in the Southern Hemisphere, with a disjoint distribution restricted to
temperate waters (Figure 1). As such, this species provides
a model for testing several predictions explicit in the westwind drift hypothesis. First, the west-wind drift hypothesis implies a Peruvian origin of the dusky dolphin followed by eastward dispersal to other regions (Figure 1)
[7,9]. In support of this prediction molecular studies have
proposed that the Peruvian population was founded
when L. obscurus and L. obliquidens, an anti-tropically distributed sister-species pair [10,11], diverged during a
southward equatorial transgression in the Pacific Ocean
approximately 1 million years ago when tropical waters
cooled [12,13]. In contrast, recent molecular studies with
better geographic sampling and both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers indicate a phylogeographic history of the dusky dolphin inconsistent with the west-wind
drift hypothesis [8,14]. These studies suggest an alternative Atlantic/Indian Ocean origin [8], which is inconsistent with an anti-tropical speciation event in the Pacific
Ocean and necessitates an alternative explanation for the
transition between oceans.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/131

Second, dispersal via the west-wind drift should result in
a pattern of genetic variation that is linear and unidirectional [8,15]. One molecular study [14] suggests that
Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand populations
have experienced relatively recent contact, perhaps as a
large ancestral Atlantic/Indian Ocean population. Therefore, the origin of the dusky dolphin and its phylogeographic history remain inconclusive.
Finally, west-wind drift represents a passive dispersal
mechanism that would result in a distributional pattern of
the dusky dolphin that should be independent of changes
in sea-surface temperatures, prey distribution, and correlated primary productivity. The dusky dolphin is concentrated in regions of high primary productivity, where
cyclic upwelling supports an abundance of schooling
anchovy (Engraulis sp.), sardines (Sardinops sp.), and
other small fishes and squid limited in their distribution
to temperate regions (Figure 1). The geographic association of these fishes and the dusky dolphin is not coincidental. Stomach-content analysis and behavioral
observations in Argentina, Peru, and New Zealand indicate the diet of the dusky dolphin is comprised mainly of
these prey items [13,16], and that movements of dolphin
populations are coincident with seasonal shifts in prey
distribution [17,18]. The preference for temperate prey
species is an ancestral characteristic of all members of the
genus Lagenorhynchus, including the Pacific white-sided
dolphin (L. obliquidens), whose distribution is correlated
with that of North Pacific anchovy (Figure 1). Sardines
and anchovy are regionally and physiologically bounded
by 13°C and 25°C isotherms (Figure 1) [4]. Clearly, the
phylogeographic history of the dusky dolphin and its temperate prey species are biologically linked, so that global
climatic oscillations affecting temperate regions would
produce a history correlated with the isolation of ocean
basins, with the degree of regional genetic divergence concordant with the closure of temperate ocean corridors and
the frequency and duration of fluctuations in sea surface
temperatures that altered the distribution and availability
of prey.
In this study, we use new nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
sequence data and complete geographic sampling to challenge the role that the west-wind drift played in the
genetic structuring and dispersal of dusky dolphin populations. We provide a global phylogeographic perspective
of the origin of the dusky dolphin, and assess the historical patterns of gene flow related to the location of temperate, up-welling coastal regions that are tightly linked to
the distribution of prey species. In contrast to previous
studies, our data support an alternative to the west-wind
drift hypothesis, with a temporal and environmental correlation between the phylogeographic history of the dusky
dolphin, its anchovy prey, and the Plio-Pleistocene pale-

Results
Diversity indices
Table 1 summarizes indices of genetic diversity. With the
exception of cyt b for Peru, haplotype and nucleotide
diversity for the cyt b and control region was high. The
lower diversity of cyt b in Peru was first described by Cassens et al. [14] and was attributed to high levels of mortality along the Peruvian coastline.
Prediction 1: Peruvian origin
The dusky dolphin d-loop and cyt b haplotype networks
recovered a Peru-specific lineage divergent from other
geographic regions by several missing intermediate haplotypes (Figures 2 and 3). Similarly, the Bayesian analysis
recovered a monophyletic clade of Peruvian haplotypes
with 100% posterior probability, and generally supported
the phylogenetic pattern of the statistical parsimony networks (Figure 2). The Bayesian analysis indicated with
96% posterior probability that the root of the dusky dolphin phylogeny was not the Peruvian clade, but rather
occurred along a lineage of South American and New Zealand haplotypes (Figure 2).
Prediction 2: Linear dispersal route
For each of the mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, both an AMOVA and Fst values revealed significant
partitioning of variation among Peru, Argentina, New
Zealand, and South Africa (Table 2). The high levels of
divergence reflect the very low number of haplotypes
found in more than one geographical region. For example, only 3 cyt b (A1.2, A1.1, and DLPH; Figure 2) and dloop (A20, AR10, A18; Figure 3) haplotypes occurred in
>1 geographic region. In no instance were Peruvian mitochondrial haplotypes shared with any other locality. Thus,
the highest Fst values were between Peru and other localities, with the level of divergence between South Africa and
Argentina considerably lower than either was to New Zealand (Table 2). Despite the high degree of divergence
between geographic regions, no apparent pattern of a linear, easterly increase in divergence was evident.

The geographic distribution of haplotypes within the statistical parsimony networks revealed a genetic signature
inconsistent with a linear dispersal route. In both cyt b
(Figure 2) and control region (Figure 3) networks, New
Zealand lineages were notably separated from the Peruvian clade by a mixture of haplotypes from South Africa,
Argentina, New Zealand, and several missing haplotypes.
With the exception of Peru, at least one haplotype at the
distal tip of each central haplotype group was from New
Zealand. Both mitochondrial networks lacked a central
haplotype in high frequency, with the majority of most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/131

frequent haplotypes clustered at the tips of the networks.
The actin network (Figure 4) was dominated by three
common alleles (a, b, l) at the center of the network
present. These alleles varied in frequency in all four biogeographic regions and in the sister taxon, L. obliquidens. In
3 of the 5 tip clades, alleles were common to South Africa
and New Zealand. The tips of the network contained alleles present in lower frequency and with more restricted
geographic distributions. In one instance an allele from
Argentina was placed at the periphery of the network
(haplotype 'e'), and this allele was also sampled in New
Zealand.
The MIGRATE analysis produced estimates of the amount
of migration between geographical regions that suggests
multiple east to west migrations dominated by dispersal
from New Zealand to South Africa and Argentina and an
absence of migration from Peru to other regions (Figure
5). The relative temporal shift in migration rates is evident
in the comparison of the independent analyses of cyt b
and the d-loop. The analysis of the cyt b gene suggests
early high levels of migration from New Zealand to South
Africa and Argentina with weak or no migration from
South Africa or Argentina to Peru. The d-loop suggests a
reduction in the rate of migration from New Zealand to
South Africa and Argentina when compared to cyt b. In the
estimates from the d-loop a weak, but significant, migration is observed from Argentina to South Africa and New
Zealand. This was not represented in the cyt b results.
Overall, these results support: 1) early and continued isolation of Peru from other regions; 2) at least 1, and possibly 2, periods of migration from New Zealand to South
Africa, with the first migration period represented by cyt b
suggesting a high, unidirectional migration rate; 3) the
later onset of migration from Argentina to South Africa
representing a possible 3rd period of migration into South
Africa; 4) a high rate of unidirectional migration from
New Zealand to Argentina correlated with that of migration to South Africa, suggesting an eastward dispersal
event from New Zealand, and 5) followed by a reduced
migration rate between New Zealand, Argentina, and
South Africa, as would be expected of populations that
gradually became genetically isolated.
Prediction 3: Dates of divergence
Divergence times calculated from cyt b data indicated a
divergence between L. obscurus and L. obliquidens of 1.9
[95% CI: 1.3–2.9] million years ago (mya), and the Peruvian lineage separated from other geographic regions 0.63
[95% CI: 0.38–0.98] mya.
Comparative phylogeography of anchovy
The Bayesian analysis recovered a phylogeny (not shown)
that supported previously established relationships
between New World species of Engraulis with two major

and a monophyletic South American (E. ringens/E.

reciprocally monophyletic, and an "Old World" clade
comprised of a polyphyletic assemblage of E. australis, E.
encrasicolus, E. capensis, and E. japonicus [6,50]. Our results
suggest a divergence between E. mordax and South American species at 9.0 [95% CI: 6.9–10.0] mya, with E. ringens
and E. anchoita diverging at 1.6 [95% CI: 1.0–2.5] mya.
The parsimony network of anchovy cyt b sequences displayed similar geographical patterns in the distribution of
genetic diversity as that of the dusky dolphin (Figure 6).

Discussion
Dusky dolphin phylogeography and the west-wind drift
hypothesis
The overall pattern of genetic variation observed for the
dusky dolphin in the Southern Hemisphere is not congruent with the west-wind drift hypothesis. Bayesian analysis
of mitochondrial DNA sequences suggests the dusky dolphin diverged from L. obliquidens via a north to south
equatorial transgression approximately 2 million years
ago, with confidence intervals overlapping previously
published estimates. However, the root of the dusky dolphin dispersal in the Southern Hemisphere was not Peru

as previously proposed [13,19], but rather somewhere in
the southern South Pacific/Indian Ocean basins. This
result is further supported by the divergence of Peru from
other regional populations relatively recently, and considerably later than the L. obliquidens/L. obscurus divergence
2.0 million years ago (Figure 7). There are several lines of
evidence from the distribution of genetic variation that
support a larger, South Pacific/Atlantic Ocean population
as the source of dusky dolphin lineages. First, the presence
of haplotypes from New Zealand at both the center and
the periphery of the actin network suggest an old New
Zealand population. Second, the central cluster of haplotypes from New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina in
low frequencies at the center of the mitochondrial DNA
haplotype networks (Figures 2 and 3) is indicative of the
remnants of a historical population with a large geographical distribution that did not include Peru. Third, there are
greater levels of genetic divergence between New Zealand
and other regions, and the lowest levels of divergence
between South Africa and Argentina (Table 2). This pattern of genetic divergence is consistent with an early transgression to the South Pacific/Indian Ocean followed by
expansion into the Atlantic.
Given that Peru is not the probable root of dusky dolphin
origin, there are two alternative scenarios to explain the
marked isolation of Peru from other geographical regions,
both of which support a South Pacific/Indian Ocean origin. First, the north to south transgression during the PlioPleistocene resulted in the formation of a large population of dusky dolphins that eventually extended from
New Zealand to Australia, South Africa, Argentina, and
dispersed through Drake's passage between the Antarctic
Peninsula and Tierra del Fuego into Peru. There is evidence that glacial cycles had profound effects on the availability of a temperate dispersal corridor for the dusky
dolphin from Peru into the Atlantic, both through the
Strait of Magellan and Drake's Passage [20-23]. These
alterations in the availability of a dispersal route may have
resulted in the isolation of a Peruvian population from
other regions, and may explain the contemporary gap in
the distribution of the dusky dolphin along the Peruvian
coast from the Strait of Magellan to southern Tierra del
Fuego (Figure 1). Second, equatorial transgression led to
a large, cohesive population of dusky dolphins that
extended from Peru across the southern Pacific and Indian
Oceans. Changes in migration patterns across the southern Pacific, coupled with restricted dispersal through
Drake's passage and the Strait of Magellan resulted in the
early isolation of Peru from other geographic regions.
Although our data are insufficient to discriminate
between these alternative hypotheses, neither is consistent
with a Peruvian origin.

magnitude (Table 3) of migrations, respectively. Only migration rates ≥ 1, the theoretical minimum necessary to maintain population cohesion, are depicted (Table 3). Under the assumption that the rate of evolution of the cyt b and d-loop regions vary,
the comparison of the cyt b with the d-loop allows for a relative temporal interpretation of migration rates, with those from
the d-loop representing more recent patterns. Based on this assumption, numbers at the end of arrows indicate the proposed
2–3 migrations into South Africa, perhaps following extirpation due to climatic fluctuations (see Discussion).

Our analysis of the phylogeography of the dusky dolphin
does not support a linear, eastward dispersal route predicted by the west-wind drift hypothesis. Our data do not
show a pattern of isolation-by-distance from Peru to New
Zealand. To the contrary, historical migration patterns
suggest an alternative hypothesis of a founding population in the South Pacific/Indian Ocean that expanded its
geographic range to the Atlantic via a temperate dispersal
corridor (Figure 5). Evidence from analysis of cyt b and dloop sequences suggests that the migration rate per generation from New Zealand westward was highest relatively
early, followed by continued, but reduced, westward
migration later in history. This reduction in westward
migration was accompanied by weak, but potentially significant, migration from Argentina eastward to South
Africa and New Zealand (Table 3, Figure 5). This hypothesis receives further support from the occurrence of very
few haplotypes in more than one geographic region, and
the relatively large number of missing intermediates
between haplotypes typical of an old population subject
to the effects of genetic drift. In the Southern Hemisphere,
eastern South America, South Africa, and New Zealand are
loosely connected by a series of small islands within a
band of temperate sea surface temperatures (Figure 1).
These islands are used at least periodically by the dusky
dolphin [9,24] and likely served as stepping-stones for
reciprocal genetic exchange across the South Pacific and
Indian Oceans. Although the dusky dolphin may have at
one time dispersed via oceanic islands, a recent study of
microsatellite variation between South Africa and Argentina found no evidence for contemporary dispersal of
dusky dolphins between these regions [14]. The large cluster of New Zealand-specific haplotypes at the periphery of
the cyt b and control region networks (Figures 2 and 3),
with large, mixed clusters of Argentina/South Africa haplotypes is indicative of the slow decay of contact between
geographical regions over time with increased genetic distance. Overall, this suggests that the observed pattern of
genetic diversity in contemporary dusky dolphin populations is the relic of a historically large population that has
since become isolated into 4 regional populations.
Comparative phylogeography of the dusky dolphin and
anchovy
The parsimony network of anchovy cyt b sequences displayed similar geographical patterns in the distribution of
genetic diversity as that of the dusky dolphin (Figure 6).
Most notable similarities were: (1) marked divergence
between South American haplotypes from those in the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and (2) north-south equatorial transgressions in the Pacific Ocean with (3) a putative
ancestor in the North Pacific. The correlation between the
patterns of divergence between the dusky dolphin and
anchovy species are likely related to paleoceanographic
conditions during the Pleistocene (Figure 7). In particular,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/131

the date of L. obliquidens/L. obscurus divergence is correlated with the cooling and subsequent warming of sea surface temperatures in the EEP, with the point estimate of
equatorial transgression occurring toward the end of the
cooling period when primary productivity was well
beyond its peak (Figure 7). The extension of nutrient rich
waters in the EEP likely offered an arena for the expansion
of anchovy in the EEP northward towards the equator into
the tropics, and coincidentally, the cooling of tropical
waters, combined with increased prey distribution and
abundance, may have provided a natural conduit for the
transgression of L. obliquidens from the Atlantic into the
Pacific. The warming of sea surface temperatures and
declining productivity in the EEP coincides not only with
the divergence of L. obliquidens/L. obscurus, but also with
the divergence of E. ringens and E. anchoita (Figure 7). This
suggests the warming of the EEP and subsequent decline
in productivity narrowed the distribution of E. ringens,
which isolated eastern and western South American populations, and consequently resulted in an anti-tropical
division of dolphin populations. Based on our study, this
founder dolphin population took refuge in the cooler
South Pacific/Indian Ocean.
Approximately 1 million years after the equatorial transgression into the Southern Hemisphere, there is evidence
for a relatively early founding of L. obscurus in New Zealand followed by migration westward to Argentina and
South Africa (Table 3, Figure 5). In addition to the evidence from the distribution of genetic diversity, these
migration events support a diffusion of the dusky dolphin
through the Indian Ocean into the Atlantic, followed by
colonization and expansion of populations in coastal
upwelling regions. There are several inferences from the
history of anchovy [6] that are correlated with the phylogeographic pattern observed in the dusky dolphin. First,
anchovy species are extremely sensitive to variation in sea
surface temperatures and current systems, and this has
been especially true in South Africa and Australia where
climate change has had a very dynamic history [6]. As a
result, South African and Australian species have suffered
multiple extinctions, bottlenecks, and large-scale introgressions from other regions during Plio-Pleistocene climate change. The most recent colonization of Australia
was most likely via equatorial transgression from Japan.
Second, there is evidence for two Pleistocene dispersals
across the Indian Ocean, one at 1.5 and the other 1.2 million years ago, between Europe (Atlantic) and Japan (west
Pacific) via Australia and South Africa (Atlantic/Indian
Oceans) "stepping stones" [6]. Similar to anchovy, our
data suggest that South Africa experienced at least 2, if not
3, independent dusky dolphin colonization events. If we
assume that the cyt b and d-loop provide some insight
into the chronology of dusky dolphin dispersal events,
our data suggest dusky dolphin migration events from

Anchovy Indian Ocean Dispersal Events

A chronological correlation of paleoceanographic events and the phylogeographic histories of the dusky dolphin and anchovy
Figure 7
(Engraulis sp)
A chronological correlation of paleoceanographic events and the phylogeographic histories of the dusky dolphin and anchovy (Engraulis sp). Above the timeline are paleoceanographic events, with the point estimates and range of
dates for each event. EEP = Eastern Equatorial Pacific; SM = Strait of Magellan. Below the timeline are events in the history of
anchovy and dusky dolphin populations. Bars represent 95% confidence intervals for point estimates, indicated by black arrows.
At least as early as 4.3 mya, a cooling trend began in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP), causing sea surface temperatures in
this tropical region to drop from 26°C to as low as 20°C in the late Pleistocene [51]. This drop in temperature caused a peak
in primary productivity 2.9 mya that was 2 to 3 times greater than average values earlier in the Plio-Pleistocene [51]. At 1.6
mya, this productivity began to decline as sea surface temperatures began to rise [51]. As warmer tropical waters returned, the
range and abundance of anchovy in the EEP would have declined, resulting in the gradual disappearance of this dispersal corridor, consequently resulting in an anti-tropical division of dolphin populations.

New Zealand and Argentina to South Africa (Figure 5)
potentially coincide with the two anchovy dispersal
events. The first was from New Zealand (Figure 5), followed by a second weaker migration event from Argentina
and perhaps a third from New Zealand (Figure 5). These
colonization events are further supported by a lack of, or
weak, migration to or from South Africa during multiple
periods (Table 3, Figure 5), suggesting that dusky dolphins, similar to anchovy, were extirpated from South
Africa perhaps due to similar response to environmental
change.

Conclusion
In summary, the phylogeographic history of the dusky
dolphin and its anchovy prey are correlated, suggesting
that passive dispersal via the west-wind drift did not play
a role in the history of the dusky dolphin. Instead, our
data support the idea that changes in primary productivity
and related abundance of prey played a key role in shaping the phylogeography of the dusky dolphin, with timing
of oceanic change coincident with the dates of important
events in the history of dolphin populations. Given the
wide-distribution and relatively recent contact between
geographic regions, it is likely that the influence of paleoceanography of the Southern Hemisphere continued
until recently, or perhaps continues, to play a role in the

dispersal behavior of the dusky dolphin. The dynamic
fluctuations in anchovy abundance on the order of decades demonstrate how moderate, short-term change in
sea surface temperatures and current systems, such as during El Nino years, are powerful enough to have dramatic
effects relative to anchovy populations [6]. Dolphins have
the advantage of active dispersal, and are perhaps more
flexible in to short-term changes in ocean conditions than
anchovy with planktonic larva dispersal. Yet in Peru, the
genetic variation is considerably lower than in other geographic regions. It may be that this is due to an historical
founder effect followed by long-term isolation. However,
it may be that population crashes in anchovy and other
temperate fishes during el Nino events, along with dolphin harvest practices, are responsible for low levels of
genetic diversity in Peru. On the scale of millennia, it is
not infeasible that repeated fluctuations in the abundance
and distribution of anchovy and other small schooling
fishes in other regions have played an important role in
the history of coastal dolphin populations.

GenBank accessions (Table 4). For tissue samples,
genomic DNA was isolated with either a standard phenolchloroform techniques or with a DNeasy Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). DNA from the same individual was used to
amplify and sequence all gene regions when possible. Tissues from Peru were not available, but sequences were
obtained from GenBank accessions (Table 4). The complete mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene (1040
nucleotides), 474 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial
control region, and 995 bp of nuclear DNA (nDNA)
intron I of the muscle actin gene (actin) were amplified
with PCR. External primer sets included: (1) cyt b-5'GAAAAACCAYCGTTGTWATTCAACT-3'
and
5'GTTTAATTAGAATYTYAGCTTTGGG3';
(2) control
region – tPro and Dlp5 [25]; (3) Actin- 5'-GATTTGGTCCCTCTATGTCTCT-3' and 5'-TACTTTTGAACTTGCCACCTAC-3'. PCR reactions included the following: 5 μl of
PCR buffer, 25 mM MgCl, 10 mM dNTP's (2.5 mM each),
1 μl 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 μl 10 uM
primer, and 5 U of Taq. Conditions of the PCR were 94°C,
2 min followed by 35 cycles at 92°C, 30 s, annealing 30 s,
and extension at 72°C, 30 s. Published annealing temperatures were used except: 765F/766R, 50°C; LagActin1/2,
58°C. PCR products were purified with QIAquick PCR
purification kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Amplicons were
sequenced with ABI (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
BigDye Terminator chemistry, and products were run on
an ABI 377. Internal primers cyt b (560, 5'-GCAACCCTAACACGATTCTTCG-3'; 610, 5'-CCAGTTTCGTGTAGGAATAATAGG-3')
and
actin
(Act5-L,
5'CCACTACTTTAGGCAG-3'; M13Act5R-H, 5'-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTCTGCCTAAACTAGTGG-3' were used to
sequence fragments to resolve ambiguities.
Sequenced fragments were edited and compiled with
Sequencher v. 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor,
Michigan). A consensus of sense and antisense strands for
each individual sequence and data partition were compiled and exported to MacClade vs. 4.05 [26]. Amino acid

translations of the open reading frames of cyt b were
examined for stop codons to verify sequence orthology.
Neither actin nor cyt b contained any insertions or deletions. The control region had a single indel that was
accommodated in the alignment with a minor alignment
adjustment. Actin sequences were subjected to a BLAST
search to verify sequence orthology. In all BLAST searches,
amplicons retrieved sequences from other delphinid or
mammalian taxa as the closest match, providing evidence
for successful amplification of the target locus.
Heterozygous nucleotide positions of the actin intron
were determined objectively with the program Mutation
Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, Pennsylvania). This
software identifies with 99% accuracy heterozygous
nucleotide positions, by employing an algorithm that
incorporates measures of peak height, peak intensity, and
background noise from ABI electrophereograms. Putative
heterozygous positions identified with Mutation Surveyor
were cross-verified by examination of raw electrophereogram data in Sequencher. Only cross-verified sites were
used in subsequent determination of allelic variation at
the locus. Allele and genotype frequencies of actin were
determined statistically with the program PHASE version
2.1 [27,28]. Three independent chains of 1000 interactions each were performed with other parameters as
default. Only those alleles and genotypes resolved with >
90% posterior probabilities were used in subsequent analyses.
Diversity indices and models of evolution
Arlequin version 2.00 [29] was used to estimate haplotype
diversity (i.e., gene diversity) (h) and nucleotide diversity
(π) [30]. Standard error of these estimates was determined
from a null distribution generated from 10000 random
permutations of the data. DnaSP version 4.0 [31] was
used to determine the number of polymorphic sites (S)
from aligned sequence data.

Modeltest version 3.06 [32] was used to test 54 nested
hypotheses of nucleotide substitution for each data partition. The Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano [33] (HKY85)
model with a correction for rate variation among sites (α
= 0.66) and a proportion of invariant sites (I = 0.39) was
selected as the best fit model for the mtDNA control
region. For the cyt b gene, the model selected was HKY85
with a correction for rate variation among sites (α =
0.003). The actin intron also had HKY85 as the best-fit
model, but with equal rates among sites. These best-fit
models were used in all analyses that employed a model
of evolution.
Prediction 1: Peruvian origin
A Bayesian analysis of cyt b sequences from L. obliquidens
and L. obscurus (Table 4), and Lissodelphis borealis (GenBank Accessions EF093025–EF093028) as an outgroup,
was performed in Mr. Bayes version 3.1 [34]. The purpose
of this analysis was to: (1) determine the geographical

population at the root of the dusky dolphin origin, (2)
provide support for the monophyly of Peruvian population haplotypes, and (3) provide a topology for subsequent estimation of divergence dates. The Bayesian
Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis
consisted of two independent searches of 25 × 106 steps (1
cold, 3 heated chains to insure adequate mixing) with the
best-fit model of substitution for cyt b determined a priori
with Modeltest. The program Tracer version 1.1.1 [35] was
used to determine convergence and the burn-in point of
chains. Trees prior to convergence were eliminated and a
majority-rule consensus tree of the remaining topologies
was constructed in PAUP* version 4.0b10 [36].
Prediction 2: Linear dispersal route
We tested the hypothesis of a unidirectional, linear dispersal route by examining the geographic partitioning of
genetic variation. The method of Templeton et al. [37] as
implemented in the program TCS version 1.18 [38] was

Page 14 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:131

used to construct separate statistical parsimony networks
for each of the three data partitions. The statistical parsimony method was chosen because of its ability to infer
missing intermediates within the network, which is more
appropriate for examining intra-specific relationships
than standard phylogenetic methods that assume bifurcating lineages [39,40]. Furthermore, reticulations, or
alternative (homoplasious) parsimonious connections,
are permitted with this method, thus allowing one to test
hypotheses regarding the complex historical processes
that shape populations. The final network gives a visual
representation of the number of mutations separating any
two haplotypes (or alleles). Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes were joined to the network within 95% parsimony
confidence limits [38]. Because of its slower rate of coalescence, parsimony confidence limits were expanded to
90% for actin alleles. Actin alleles of L. obliquidens were
included in the statistical parsimony network to examine
the pattern of allelic diversity at the base of the L. obliquidens/L. obscurus divergence. Reticulations in the actin parsimony network were observed and attributed either to
lack of lineage coalescence, homoplasious substitutions,
or recombination among sites. Of these, recombination is
the most problematic for inferring evolutionary history
from nuclear loci. Therefore, the likelihood of recombination among alleles was evaluated with the program
Lamarc version 1.2.2 [41].
An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [42] and Fstatistics [43] were calculated with Arlequin, version 3.1
[29] to determine amount of genetic variation within and
among geographic regions for cyt b, control region, and
actin data. The significance of these statistics was determined by comparison of observed values to those derived
from 10000 random permutations of the data. The "casecontrol" option in PHASE 2.1 was used to group actin
alleles by geographic region and to subsequently test the
null hypothesis of random association of alleles among
localities. Test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of actin
genotypes was performed in Arlequin, version 3.1.
The program MIGRATE [44,45] was used to examine the
pattern of dispersal (migration) between geographic
regions. Although cyt b and d-loop are linked, the rate of
evolution of each data partition is different with d-loop
being the fastest evolving region of the mammalian mitochondrion. Therefore, the cyt b and d-loop data were analyzed independently in order to examine dispersal events
over different relative time scales, under the assumption
that the d-loop will provide evidence for the most contemporary dispersal/migration events. Each data partition
was subjected to a maximum likelihood MCMC search
strategy with initial theta values generated from Fst estimates, and evolutionary model parameters determined
from MODELTEST. Each search was comprised of a com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/131

bination of 10 short and 3 long chains with an adaptive
heating scheme of 4 chains (temperatures 1.0, 1.2, 1.5,
3.0) and a swap interval of 1 in order to insure adequate
mixing among chains. Ten short chains of 200,000 steps
were run with a sampling increment of 20, for a total of
10,000 sampled trees per chain. A total of 3 long chains
were run for 20,000,000 steps, with a sampling increment
of 20 for a total of 100,000 trees sampled.
Prediction 3: Dates of divergence
We estimated dates of divergence between L. obliquidens/
L. obscurus lineages and the isolation of the L. obscurus
Peruvian population from other geographical regions to
determine if historical changes in sea surface temperature,
primary productivity, current systems, and the phylogeography of the dusky dolphin are correlated. The Bayesian
cyt b phylogeny with branch lengths was subsequently
used in RHINO version 1.2 [46] to estimate via maximum
likelihood the date of divergence and 95% confidence
intervals. A previous study of Lagenorhynchus cyt b [12]
suggests the evolution of this locus is clock-like; therefore
dates of divergence were calculated under the assumption
of a molecular clock with substitution model parameters
predetermined by Modeltest. Two calibration points were
used, both strongly corroborated from the fossil record
and molecular divergence estimates [47]: (1) Phocoenidae/Monodontidae, 13.0 my; (2) Phocoenida/Platanistidae, 28 myr.
Comparative phylogeography of anchovy
Published cyt b sequences (n = 58) for Old World (Engraulis capensis, E. japonicus, E. encrasicolus) and New World (E.
mordax, E. ringens, E. anchoita) anchovy species were
assembled from GenBank (Accessions AY923766–
AY923823) [48]. A Bayesian analysis was performed on a
matrix of 465 base pairs, and included Gonorhynchus greyi
(NC004702), Chanos chanos (NC004693), Sardiops sagax
(AF472586), and S. caeruleus (AF472585) to root the phylogeny. The Bayesian Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain
Monte Carlo analysis consisted of two independent
searches of 2.0 × 106 steps (1 cold, 3 heated chains to
insure adequate mixing) with a model of substitution referenced in Grant (reference). In order to compare dates of
divergence of anchovy species and the dusky dolphin
populations, the resulting topology and the program
RHINO 1.2 [46] were used to estimate times of divergence
of Northern Hemisphere E. mordax from Southern Hemisphere E. ringens/E. anchoita clade, and between western
(E. ringens) and eastern (E. anchoita) South America. The
oldest European anchovy fossil is 10 million years old
[49], thus this date was used as a calibration point. In
addition, a previously published cyt b haplotype network
[50] was compared to that of the dusky dolphin in order
to assess similarities in the geographic distribution of
genetic variation. This network, plus additional, previ-

ously published phylogeographic inferences for anchovy
(i.e., [6,50]) were summarized and compared to the phylogeographic history of the dusky dolphin.
