Abstract
Introduction: While infectious peritonitis is a common occurrence in patients with liver cirrhosis,
Mycoplasma is rarely identified as a causative agent.
Case presentation: We report the case of a 43-year-old Caucasian woman presenting with an
extensive abdominal conglomerate tumor mimicking malignancy. A histologic specimen showed a
xanthogranulomatous inflammation. Subsequently, Mycoplasma hominis was identified as the specific
causative infectious agent using a broad-range (eubacterial) polymerase chain reaction. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an intra-abdominal Mycoplasma infection presenting
as a conglomerate tumor.
Conclusion: An unusual presentation of an inflammatory process in the abdomen or an insufficient
response to conventional therapy should prompt clinicians to consider atypical infectious agents in
the differential diagnosis. This case illustrates the potential of newer diagnostic methods, since certain
fastidious microorganisms may not be diagnosed and treated appropriately using conventional means.

Introduction
The term pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) refers to the
inflammation of the upper female genital tract (endometrium, fallopian tubes and contiguous structures) following an ascending infection. It is the most frequent cause of

the need for emergency treatment in gynecological
departments [1].
The most important sequelae of PID in women of
childbearing age are infertility, ectopic pregnancy and

chronic pelvic pain. It is often difficult to determine the
disease’s causative agent because, apart from the usual
pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, uncommon agents such as Mycoplasma hominis
have to be considered as well [2,3]. The role of Mycoplasma
hominis as a causative pathogen in PID has been
demonstrated in a pelvic specimen obtained through
laparoscopy [4].
Xanthogranulomatous inflammation is characterized by
granulation tissue, foamy histiocytes and sporadic multinucleated giant cells without the occurrence of true
granuloma formation. It has also been reported in the
gall bladder, kidneys and female genital tract [5].
We report the case of a patient with a partly necrotizing,
severe and impressively extensive intra-abdominal inflammation that mimicked a malignancy. The inflammation
could be attributed to a smoldering infection with M.
hominis, most likely a sequel of a tubo-ovarian abscess.
Diagnosis was delayed due to a confounding primary
diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection with
concomitant hydropic decompensation and renal failure,
as well as biologic features of M. hominis hindering its
detection by conventional means. The key to establishing
diagnosis was a biomolecular approach using a broadrange (eubacterial) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

Case presentation
A 43-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to a
peripheral hospital due to continuous and diffused
abdominal pain for one week prior to presentation. A
laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Intraoperatively, the surgeon noticed an irregular surface on the liver
consistent with liver cirrhosis, although unfortunately no
liver biopsy was obtained. The surgical procedure and the
postoperative course were uneventful. CHC infection was
diagnosed serologically as the cause of the asymptomatic
liver disease. Tests for other infectious agents including
HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, brucellosis and
leptospirosis, as well as for metabolic liver disease were
negative. A week after cholecystectomy, the patient was
transferred to the intensive care unit because of continuing
diffuse abdominal pain, progressive oliguria, hypotonia
and anasarca. Ascites was detected by ultrasound. Paracentesis revealed a markedly elevated white blood cell
count (27600/µl, 90% neutrophils) and low serum-ascites
albumin gradient (7 g/dl). Streptococcus oralis (sensitive to
all tested antibiotics) grew in the ascites culture but not in
the blood cultures. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone
was thus begun. An abdominal computed tomography
was performed because of the patient’s abdominal pain
and slightly elevated amylase levels. Besides the moderate
amount of ascites the only pathological finding was an
incidental cystic lesion in the patient’s right adnexa.

The patient was subsequently admitted to our hospital
due to persistent liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh class B
(9 points), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)
score 12), bacterial peritonitis and impaired renal function
(minimal estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with
the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
formula was 23 ml/min).
Soon after she was transferred to our hospital, the patient
exhibited hepatorenal syndrome, which was successfully
treated with terlipressin. Repeated paracentesis was
necessary to relieve respiratory compromise and abdominal distension. Cytological analysis didn’t reveal any
evidence of malignant cells. Cell count continuously
decreased to 400 cells/µl, with 3% neutrophils but 45%
lymphocytes, some of the latter with reactive changes; the
first paracentesis in our hospital revealed 4200 cells/µl
with 64% neutrophils and 15% lymphocytes. There was
no bacterial growth in any of the ascites samples or blood
cultures. Given the prolonged critical condition of the
patient, elevated white blood cell count, ascites and
elevated C-reactive protein level, the patient’s antibiotic
therapy was switched from ceftriaxone to piperacillin and
tazobactam.
Since both the repeated ultrasound examinations and
computed tomography scans (Figure 1) showed a steady
increase in the size of the cystic tumor of the adnexa, a
diagnostic laparotomy was performed. Strikingly, there
was an extensive inflammatory reaction in the patient’s
lower abdomen with a conglomerate tumor encompassing

Figure 1. Computed tomography of the pelvis. A large
conglomerate tumor (arrow) with hypodense and isodense
fractions that surrounds and partly compresses intestinal
loops of the ileum (arrowhead) is shown. There is no sharp
demarcation of the lesion to the rectum that is filled with
contrast agent (asterisk).

cause of PID and its secondary complications like
peritonitis. However, repetitive analyses of cervical
smear, urine and ascites using PCR for these two
pathogens were always negative in our patient, and thus
virtually excluded such a diagnosis. Both gynecological
infections are mainly acquired via heterosexual contact in
women in their reproductive years, and this explains the
high rate of co-existence of both causative agents.

the uterus and adjacent parts of the sigmoid, rectum and
ileocecal junction with crumbly, partly necrotic tissue in
between. The whole of the conglomerate tumor was
removed. Histology of all examined tissue samples
revealed chronic, partly sub-acute inflammatory changes
with a xanthogranulomatous pattern and there was no
evidence of malignancy (Figure 2).
The patient had no history of mycobacterial infection or
whole blood interferon g assay. PCR analysis for mycobacteria from adnexa tissue and ascites was also negative.
However, results of eubacterial PCR of ascites showed
positive for M. hominis. The same pathogen grew in
repeated cultures of ascites, this time using a special
culture medium.

Discussion
This case illustrates the difficulty in identifying the
causative agent in a case of infectious peritonitis with an
extensive intra-abdominal inflammatory reaction, especially considering the confounding factors present in this
case, including cholecystectomy and decompensated liver
disease due to chronic hepatitis C infection. However, this
case demonstrates the importance of an aggressive
approach using laparoscopy or even laparotomy, as well
as the value of newer biomolecular culture-independent
techniques, in the diagnostic evaluation of such inflammatory reactions.
Infections with Chlamydia and Gonococcus are well
described in the literature representing the most frequent

Gynecological infections potentially increase the transmission of and the risk of infection with HIV. On the other
hand, HIV infection clearly increases the susceptibility for
infectious diseases including PID. There are conflicting
data on whether HIV infection influences the spectrum of
pathogens responsible for PID or not, but there seems to
be a higher incidence of adnexal masses and tubo-ovarian
abscesses in women with HIV infection and PID.
Furthermore, genitourinary tuberculosis is more common
in women with HIV infection and the genitourinary
system is reported to be involved in at least a third of all
extra-pulmonary cases of tuberculosis. Interestingly, the
association between tuberculosis and HIV is considered a
substantial public health threat, particularly in developing
countries.
In this case, considering the intraoperative findings after
diagnostic laparotomy, as well as the patient’s history of
fever and weight loss, tuberculosis was a main concern.
However, in our patient, PCR for mycobacteria from both
the ascites and histologic specimens were negative.
Although this method only has a relatively low sensitivity,
the negative whole blood interferon g assay, as well as no
personal history of contact with tuberculosis and a normal
chest X-ray, strongly argued against a diagnosis of
tuberculosis. HIV infection had already been ruled out
by serologic testing in the peripheral hospital. Negative
test results were also confirmed after admission to our
hospital.
Another potential mechanism for the findings in our
patient was possible spillage of gallstones into the
peritoneal cavity, which is a well-known complication
leading to inflammatory changes that may sometimes
present as mass lesions [6]. The lack of pigmented material
in tissue analyses and the uneventful removal of the
gallbladder strongly argued against this cause.
The exact pathogenesis of xanthogranulomatous inflammation remains unclear. Various possible causes such as
infection, ineffective antibiotic therapy, irradiation, endometriosis, abnormalities in lipid metabolism and ineffective clearance of bacteria by phagocytes, have been
suggested. It has been suggested that after the occurrence
of tissue necrosis, cholesterol and other lipids are released

and subsequently phagocytosed by macrophages [7].
Knowledge of this entity is important, as it may mimic
malignancy. Among others, infectious agents Escherichia
coli, Proteus vulgaris, Enterococcus spp. and Proteus magnus
have been described [8]. However, these micropathogens
do not typically play an etiological role in PID.
Phenotypic assessments including morphology and staining behavior, growth factor requirements, fermentation
and assimilation of specific carbohydrates are still the
mainstay in the identification of infectious agents.
Genotypic methods as an alternative approach have gained
more popularity for bacterial phylogeny, the identification of non-cultivable pathogens and the differentiation
of cultured microorganisms. The small-subunit (16S)
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene comprises relevant phylogenetic information, and this renders it a suitable gene for
amplification and identification [9]. After sequence determination following amplification of 16s ribosomal DNA
from species-specific sections, the use of large comparative
databases may allow the allocation of the unidentified
pathogen to a specific group of bacteria [10].

and to all other antibiotics that target the cell wall. In our
patient, the antibiotics administered initially (ceftriaxone
and piperacillin/tazobactam) were directed against common causative agents of bacterial peritonitis but did not
cover M. hominis. This allowed the continued expansion of
the infection. Bacterial cultures on appropriate medium
that are specifically suitable for growth of M. hominis,
M. fermetans and U. urealyticum from the last paracentesis
sample were ordered after sequences of 16S-rRNA gene
specific for M. hominis were detected. The cultures showed
growth of M. hominis and thus proved a persistent intraabdominal infection. Antibiotic therapy with doxycycline
was initiated with consequent improvement of the clinical
condition of the patient and the resolution of inflammatory markers in her blood.

Conclusions
This case underlines the importance of considering
atypical infectious agents in unexplained inflammatory
peritoneal processes even if conventional microbiological
methods reveal no specific pathogens. Modern biomolecular approaches may be helpful in such instances.

The use of these culture-independent techniques is
especially useful in detecting fastidious microorganisms
that are difficult to cultivate and identify [11], as in the
analysis of resected heart valves in culture-negative
endocarditis [12]. Molecular identification may be superior to standard identification procedures for isolates
not revealing a reliable identification result when using
standard techniques [11].

Abbreviations

M. hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are frequently
isolated in the lower urogenital tract in healthy adults,
although they are associated with genital infection only in
women.

Consent

Extragenital infections with M. hominis, such as septicaemia,
infection of hematoma, prosthetic valve endocarditis and
peritonitis, are well known. There are only a few case reports
of patients with peritonitis after renal transplantation
(n = 6), on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (n = 1)
or after liver transplantation (n = 1) [13]. Thus, most of the
recorded cases of extragenital M. hominis infection have
associated it with immunosuppression [14]. Although
speculative, we consider this patient’s liver cirrhosis was a
contributing factor in the development of this extensive
infectious complication. Susceptibility to infection in liver
cirrhosis may be due to multiple factors, such as cytokine
dysfunction altering the inflammatory response, impaired
cellular immunity and hemodynamic dysfunction with
systemic vasodilatation [15].
The main structural characteristic of Mycoplasma is the lack
of cell wall, which makes it innately resistant to b-lactams
