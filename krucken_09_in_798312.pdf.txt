Abstract
Background: Cyclophilins (Cyps) are peptidyl cis/trans isomerases implicated in diverse processes
such as protein folding, signal transduction, and RNA processing. They are also candidate drug
targets, in particular for the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A. In addition, cyclosporine is known
to exhibit anti-parasitic effects on a wide range of organisms including several apicomplexa. In order
to obtain new non-immunosuppressive drugs targeting apicomplexan cyclophilins, a profound
knowledge of the cyclophilin repertoire of this phylum would be necessary.
Results: BLAST and maximum likelihood analyses identified 16 different cyclophilin subfamilies
within the genomes of Cryptosporidium hominis, Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Theileria
annulata, Theileria parva, and Babesia bovis. In addition to good statistical support from the
phylogenetic analysis, these subfamilies are also confirmed by comparison of cyclophilin domain
architecture. Within an individual genome, the number of different Cyp genes that could be
deduced varies between 7–9 for Cryptosporidia and 14 for T. gondii. Many of the putative
apicomplexan cyclophilins are predicted to be nuclear proteins, most of them presumably involved
in RNA processing.
Conclusion: The genomes of apicomplexa harbor a cyclophilin repertoire that is at least as
complex as that of most fungi. The identification of Cyp subfamilies that are specific for lower
eukaryotes, apicomplexa, or even the genus Plasmodium is of particular interest since these
subfamilies are not present in host cells and might therefore represent attractive drug targets.

Background
Cyclophilins (Cyps) represent an ancient protein family
with peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase), also
called rotamase, activity (EC 5.2.1.8) that can be found in
archea, prokaryotes and eukaryotes [1,2]. PPIases catalyze
the cis/trans isomerization of peptide bonds preceding a
prolyl residue in polypeptides. Although ribosomes synthesize proteins with peptidyl-prolyl bonds in the lower

energy trans state, about 5–7% of these bonds are estimated to occur in the unfavorable cis conformation [3].
PPIases are thought to be important for establishing this
conformation during protein folding or refolding after
transport of proteins into organelles [1] by stabilizing the
cis/trans transition state [4]. Moreover, some Cyps possess
chaperone activity that is independent from their PPIase
activity [5]. Many Cyps are able to bind the widely used

immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) that on one
hand inhibits their PPIase activity but on the other hand
results in a gain of function phenotype due to binding of
Cyp/CsA complexes to calcineurin-like phosphatases
resulting in inhibition of phosphatase activity. In mammalian T cells, inhibition of calcineurin by Cyp/CsA complexes after T cell receptor stimulation prevents
transcription of the autocrine growth factor IL-2 resulting
in immunosuppression.
In addition to cyclophilins, two also widely spread but
structurally unrelated protein families, FK506-binding
proteins (FKBP) and parvulins, also exhibit PPIase activity
[3].
Eukaryotic genomes usually encode several Cyps. Small
Cyps containing only a single Cyp domain are present
along with larger multi-domain proteins containing a Cyp
domain in addition to one or several unrelated domains.
For instance, the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains four single domain Cyps – including SpCyp4 which has a signal peptide and can be found
in the ER – and five multi domain Cyps [6]. Two (Encephalitozoon cuniculi), eight (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and 17
(Rhizopus oryzae) Cyps could be identified [7-9]e.g. in the
genomes of representative microsporidia and fungi.
Despite their ubiquitous expression and high evolutionary conservation, convincing evidence for the importance
of Cyps for cellular homeostasis is largely missing. In S.
cerevisae, for instance, none of the eight Cyps is essential,
and even a mutant lacking all eight Cyps and four FKBPs
simultaneously has only a subtle phenotype [10].
Parasite Cyps have received increasing attention in recent
years (see [11] for review) in particular because CsA has
not only immunosuppressive but also anti-parasitic activity as already demonstrated in 1981 for schistosoma and
murine malaria infections [12,13]. Since then, anti-parasitic activity of CsA has been demonstrated for numerous
protozoan and helminth parasites [11,14]. Because the
anti-parasitic effects of CsA can be superimposed in vivo
by its immunosuppressive action, treatment of infected
animals with CsA may either result in resolution/amelioration or aggravation of the clinical course [11]. However,
the development of non-immonosuppressive CsA analogs
that retain anti-parasitic activity shows that parasite Cyps
may well be attractive drug targets [15].
Since the discovery of CsA sensitivity of Plasmodium
chabaudi and Plasmodium berghei [13], development of
several other apicomplexa has been described to be inhibitable by CsA including Plasmodium falciparum [16], Toxoplasma gondii [17], Eimeria tenella [18], Eimeria vermiformis,
Eimeria mitis [19], and Cryptosporidium parvum [20]. In
contrast, Theileria annulata schizonts appear to be unaffected by CsA though the drug inhibits proliferation of

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/27

Theileria-transformed lymphocytes – presumably by acting on host cell Cyps [21].
Despite the long time since discovery of CsA effects on
these important parasites, current knowledge about the
anti-parasitic mechanisms of CsA is rather limited. For P.
falciparum, two major small cytosolic Cyps and their inhibition by CsA and CsA derivates have been described [2224]. Inhibition of P. falciparum calcineurin by a complex
of CsA and PfCyp19 (= PfCyp19A in reference [25]) has
also been demonstrated biochemically [26]. Using
sequence analysis of highly CsA-resistant mutant lines of
P. falciparum, Kumar et al. [25] could show that point
mutations in the regulatory or the catalytic subunit of calcineurin or in PfCyp19 or PfCyp21.7 (= PfCyp19B) are
sufficient to induce CsA resistance. In contrast, no mutations in the PfCyp24.6 (= PfCyp24) gene were identified.
However, since CsA resistance in five out of nine mutant
lines was not associated with changes in the sequence of
any of these four genes, additional gene products can be
expected to be involved in CsA action in P. falciparum. The
situation is even more complicated by the fact that at least
certain non-immunosuppressive CsA derivates have been
shown to have profound anti-parasitic effects possibly by
acting on ABC transporters of the multi-drug-resistance
protein family in T. gondii and P. faciparum [15,27].
In addition to their role as putative drug targets, cyclophilins of apicomplexan parasites are also interesting from an
evolutionary point of view, since a novel group of dual
family PPIases has been recently described for T. gondii,
which contain both a Cyp and an FKBP domain in the
same protein [28]. Such FCBPs (FK506- and cyclosporinbinding proteins) appear to be present in the genomes of
archae- and eubacteria as well [5], and the phylogenetic
relationship of apicomplexan FCBP with such noneukaryotic enzymes remains to be addressed.
Up to now, research on apicomplexan Cyps has focused
on small, abundant single-domain Cyps. Only recently, a
multi-domain WD40 repeat containing Cyp has been
described for E. tenella [29]. The progress in genome
sequencing projects for several apicomplexan parasites
allows now for systematic searches for cyclophilins and
will presumably bring the multi-domain Cyps more into
the focus of research. This work is aimed to provide a
framework for such analysis by identifying and comparing
the cyclophilin repertoire of the important apicomplexan
pathogens T. gondii, P. falciparum, Theileria parva, T. annulata, Babesia bovis, and Cryptosporidium hominis.

sequences were performed. The Cyp proteins deduced
from T. gondii, P. falciparum, T. annulata, T. parvum, B.
bovis, and C. hominis are listed in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
respectively. Two putative Cyps from Cryptosporidium
muris were included in the analysis, because the orthologous Cyps could not be identified in the genome of C.
hominis. Moreover, two Cyps deduced from the Plasmodium yoelii genome were included as the corresponding P.
falciparum are quite unusual. Table S1 – in Additional file
1 in the supplemental online material – lists all Cyp proteins encoded in the genomes of S. pombe and Homo sapiens that were used for comparison with the apicomplexan
Cyp repertoire.
The number of putative Cyp genes identified per genome
ranges from 7 to 9 for C. hominis (whether or not
orthologs for CmCyp44.6 and CmCyp48.8 are assumed
to be present in C. hominis) to 14 for T. gondii, while the
genomes of all four haemosporidia exhibit an intermediate number of 11 putative Cyps per genome. For T. annulata, an ortholog to TpCyp20.3 appears to be present on
chromosome 1, however, its complete sequence could not
be deduced from the genome data. Therefore, Table 2 lists
only 10 Cyps for this organism although 11 Cyps are
expected to be present. The number of Cyps in apicomplexan genomes is very similar to the 6 to 11 Cyp genes in
the genomes of most fungi although it should be mentioned that there are fungi with extreme low (2 Cyps in the
microsporidium Encephalitozoon cuniculi) and extreme
high (16 Cyps in Rhizopus oryzae) numbers of Cyp genes
[9]. An extremely high number of 19 Cyp genes per
genome can also be found in the kinetoplastid protozoan
parasite Trypanosoma cruzi [30]. Similar extremes cannot
be found in the genomes of the currently sequenced apicomplexa.
Phylogenetic relationship of Cyp domains
In order to identify subfamilies within the Cyp repertoire
and to analyze their phylogenetic relationship, the puta-

tive Cyp domains as identified by CD-BLAST [31,32] were
aligned by ClustalW2 [33]. Maximum likelihood analysis
with PhyML [34] was used to calculate an unrooted tree
shown in Figure 1. Statistical support values at the
branches are calculated by a likelihood ratio test which
produces values similar but not identical to those
obtained by bootstrapping [34].
Although it may be assumed that small Cyps containing
only a single Cyp domain have been present early in evolution before occurrence of Cyps with one or more additional domains, it is not possible to unequivocally
identify a "primitive" Cyp protein subfamily in the apicomplexa from which all other subfamilies have derived,
since there are several single- and multi-domain Cyps in
the genomes of all protists analyzed so far. Obviously,
many subfamilies of Cyps have already evolved before
spread of the major lines of eukaryotic evolution.
According to their phylogenetic relationship, 16 different
Cyp protein subfamilies were defined here (Figure 1) –
many of them well known from other eukaryotes. All
these subfamilies exhibit a statistical support in the likelihood ratio test implemented in PhyML of at least 85%
and all families containing Cyps with multiple domains
are also supported by their domain architecture. The only
exception is the subfamily containing putative Cyps with
a so-called SYF2 domain, a domain first described in the
yeast splicing factor SYF2 [35]. One of these putative
SYF2-containing Cyps, i.e. PfCyp80.9, has a very divergent
sequence that does not fall into the same PhyML-deduced
group as the other subfamily members (Figure 1B). The
corresponding protein deduced from P. yoelii (PyCyp74)
was therefore also included and the latter is apparently an
ortholog to the SYF2 Cyps of other apicomplexa. Since the
subfamily of Cyps with SYF2 is strongly supported by
domain architecture and all Plasmodium species but P. falciparum posses putative SYF2 Cyps with high similarity to
PyCyp74, it appears that the putative PfCyp80.9 was either

mic localization, cytoplasmic Cyps containing a
Cyp_ABH type domain (CD database accession-no
[cd01926]) are considered to be the most important
receptors for CsA leading to inactivation of the cytosolic
calcineurins [39]. Indeed, mutations in PfCyp19 appear to
be sufficient to confer resistance to CsA to P. falciparum
[25].
All these small cytosolic Cyps have no introns interrupting their putative ORFs (Figure 2A).
Conspicuously, the putative PPIA-like Cyps of the
piroplasms, BbCyp23.7 (Figure 2A), TpCyp25.5 and
TaCyp25.7 (Figure 2B), are predicted to contain an NH2terminal signal peptide (SP) for cotranslational transport
into the ER and for the latter two the PATS algorithm [40]
predicts an apicoplast transit signal (AP) following the SP.
Such combinations of SP and AP are typical for proteins
which are transported into the apicoplast [41]. TpCyp25.5
has been described to be cotranslationally transported
into dog pancreas rough microsomes in a wheat germ in
vitro translation system [42] demonstrating that the SP is
functionally active in this heterologous system. Since no
removal of the signal peptide was detectable in this system, TpCyp25.5 was proposed to be anchored to the
membrane of the ER via an uncleavable signal peptide.
However, since transport of proteins to the apicoplast has
been shown to require passage through the ER (for review
see [41]) and the properties of proteases responsible for
removal of signal peptides might be quite different in apicomplexa and mammals, these results do not exclude that
in vivo TpCyp25.5 is transported further from the lumen of
the ER into the apicoplast. Moreover, it cannot yet be
excluded that the putative BbCyp23.7 will turn out to be
localized in the apicoplast as well since the sequence
between the SP and the Cyp domain is long enough to
function as an AP. Since the neural network analysis used

in PATS has been trained only on AP of proteins from P.
falciparum, it might well turn out to be less sensitive to
functional AP in other apicomplexa such as B. bovis. However, TpCyp25.5 and TaCyp25.7 appear to be more closely
related to HsPPIA and SpCyp1 than to the other apicomplexan Cyps of this group whereas BbCyp23.7 clusters
together with the clearly cytoplasmic Cyps of other apicomplexa. Whether the position of apicoplast Cyps in the
phylogram truly reflects different evolutionary origins
from cytoplasmic Cyps or different selective pressures
caused by localization in cytoplasm and apicoplast cannot be decided using the current dataset. In addition to
the presence of a putative AP, this group also differs from
the small cytosolic apicomplexan Cyps – including
BbCyp23.7 – by the presence of three introns within the
coding sequence. In order to evaluate whether these Cyps
with AP are more closely related to Cyps from plants or
algae, BLASTp analyses were performed against protein
database entries from dinoflagellates, red, green, and
brown algae, green plants, and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, highest similarity was always found to cytosolic
PPIA-like Cyps and never to Cyps known to be localized
in plastids (data not shown). Experimental evidence concerning the localization of BbCyp23.7, TaCyp25.7 and
TpCyp25.5 might provide important information on the
evolutionary history of these proteins as well, as they
should be considered to be monophyletic if all three turn
out to be localized in the apicoplast. Moreover, the fact
that Theileria species do not have a prototypical cyctosolic
PPIA-like Cyp might explain why T. annulata is resistant to
CsA [21].
PPIA-like Cyps with signal peptide
The dendrogram in Figure 1 reveals a group of putative
small Cyps with SP that also contain a Cyp_ABH type
domain and are relatively closely related to the PPIA-type
Cyps. The domain architecture and genomic organization

of these Cyps is schematically presented in Figure 3. One
putative member of this Cyp subfamily could be identified in each apicomplexan genome. In contrast to the
small cytosolic PPIA-like Cyps, the coding regions of all
subfamily members are interrupted by introns. Whereas
C. hominis and T. gondii show a very similar exon/intron
structure with 4 introns, the putative genes of both Theileria species have only 2 introns – apparently due to fusion
of exons 3 and 4 – and after further fusion of exons 1 and
2 only a single intron remains in B. bovis. In PfCyp21.7,
loss of introns has resulted in a Cyp domain that is
encoded by a single exon. However, a new intron has also

appeared within the region encoding the SP, which is
encoded by a single exon in the other Cyps of this subfamily.
Cyps within the secretory pathway of other eukaryotes are
typically of the PPIB type. The phylogram in Figure 1,
however, reveals that the Cyp subfamily with putative ERlocalization in apicomplexa does not form any cluster
with HsPPIB and SpCyp4 and is therefore proposed not to
represent orthologs of PPIB-like Cyps. Apparently, Cyps in
the secretory pathway evolved independently at least
twice during evolution of eukaryotic Cyps.

are shown. Species are abbreviated as in Fig. 1. Cyp_ABH,
ABH-type Cyp domain (CD accession-no.: [cd01926]); SP,
signal peptide.
For some members of this Cyp subfamily experimental
evidence regarding their expression and function is available. First, the PfCyp21.7 protein has been shown to be
expressed at extremely high levels in blood-stage parasites,
constituting up to 0.5% of total cellular protein [24]. Conspicuously, PfCyp21.7 has been been reported not to be
confined to the secretory pathway but to be at least partially present in the cytosol as well [24]. This raises the
possibility that this Cyp subfamily might also be able to
interact with cytosolic calcineurin-like phosphatases.
Indeed, genetic analysis provides evidence that a mutation
in PfCyp21.7 is sufficient to confer resistance to CsA even
in the presence of intact PfCyp19 [25].
Secondly, TgCyp19.6 has been shown to be secreted by
the parasite and to trigger release of IL-12 from host den-

dritic cells. Moreover, a 19.4 kDa Cyp from Neospora caninum belongs to the same orthology group (data not
shown). This protein has been described to be secreted by
the parasite and to be present in large amounts in culture
supernatants of cell infected with N. caninum tachyzoites
[43]. NcCyp19.4 from cell culture supernatants was
shown to be a very potent inducer of IFNg production by
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4+ T cells.
Induction of IFNg by NcCyp19.4 could be specifically
inhibited by CsA in a dose dependant manner. These
results indicate that apicomplexan Cyps with signal peptide are not only involved in protein folding in the secretory
pathway
but
can
fulfill
important
immunomodulatory functions in infected tissues.
Mitochondrial Cyps
Putative Cyps with a mitochondrial localization signal at
their NH2-terminus are schematically shown in Figure 4.
The mitochondrial localization signal and a cleavage site
were significantly predicted by MitoProt II [44] for
TaCyp24.8 and TpCyp24.5. In contrast, cleavage site prediction was not possible for both PfCyp32.3 and
BbCyp26.9. Nevertheless, MitoProt II predicts a high
probability of mitochondrial localization and the algorithm PlasMit [45], which was specifically developed to
predict mitochondrial proteins in Plasmodium, also suggest a mitochondrial localization of PfCyp32.3. Putative
proteins of this Cyp subfamily could be detected only in
the haemosporidia but neither in T. gondii nor in C. hominis. In T. gondii, mitochondrial PPIase activity might be
achieved by the putative TgCyp31.8, a member of the subfamily of apicomplexa-specific Cyps (Figure 6). In contrast to all other members of this group, TgCyp31.8 is
predicted to have an NH2-terminal mitochondrial localization signal. However, mitochondrial PPIase activity
might also be dispensable in apicomplexan mitochondria
as it is completely absent from the genomes of both C.
hominis and C. muris.

The genomic organization differs largely between the different genera with 5 exons in T. gondii, 3 or 4 in T. annulata
and T. parva, respectively, and only a single large exon in
P. falciparum (Figure 4).
Plasmodium-specific large Cyps
A group of putative Cyp proteins that appears to be
present exclusively in Plasmodium species is shown in Figure S1 in Additional file 2 in the supplemental online
material. In order to demonstrate that these proteins represent a subfamily on their own, the putative PyCyp69.8
was included in the phylogenetic analysis shown in Figure
1. Figure S1 reveals that both PfCyp72.5 and PyCyp69.8
possess several nuclear localization signals and two
coiled-coil domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interaction. Moreover, PSORT II recognizes
an RNA-binding motif typical for components of ribonuPage 9 of 24

cleoprotein particles [46] in PfCyp72.5 further suggesting
that this subfamily might somehow be involved in RNA
processing.
Cyps with SYF2 domain
A multi-domain Cyp subfamily within the Cyp_ABH
domain group are the predicted Cyps containing an SYF2
domain (PFAM accession-no.: [pfam08231]) (Figures 1
and 5). This subfamily does not form a monophyletic
cluster in Figure 1B due to the fact that putative PfCyp80.9
is quite aberrant and therefore clusters together with the
Plasmodium-specific Cyps described in the section above.
However, since PfCyp80.9 contains a SYF2 domain and
since its ortholog in P. yoelii, PyCyp74, is closely related to
the other SYF2 domain containing Cyps, this family
should nevertheless be considered to be monophyletic.

In the genome of C. hominis, a SYF2 Cyp could not be
identified, presumably due to incomplete sequence information since a putative orthologues protein is encoded in
the genome of C. muris, and this sequences was therefore

included for further analyses (Figures 1 and 5). The predicted SYF2-Cyps are quite large proteins with predicted
molecular weights between 48.8 kDa (C. muris) and 80.9
kDa (P. falciparum). The Cyp_ABH domain is located in
the immediate NH2-terminus of the proteins while the
SYF2 domain can be found close to the COOH-terminus
(Figure 5). The large region between these two defined
domains does not exhibit any known sequence features,
and homology between individual subfamily members is
very low. Only a few scattered amino acids appear to be
conserved throughout the subfamily. In accordance with
a suspected role in RNA processing, PSORT II predicts at
least one nuclear localization signal in all putative SYF2Cyps but CmCyp48.8. The latter is also peculiar due to its

small size and the presence of only an incomplete SYF2
domain. It must at least be considered that the prediction
of the protein coding region of this protein from the
genomic sequence is still only partially correct.
The genomic organization of SYF2-Cyps is again characterized by progressing loss of introns. While the coding
sequence of TgCyp66.2 is spread across six small exons,
there is a large first exon in all other members of the subfamily encoding the Cyp domain, the intervening region
and the first part of the SYF2 domain. The remaining
sequence is split in two exons in TpCyp59.8 and
BbCyp57.3 which have further fused in TaCyp63 to give a
two exon structure. Finally, the coding sequence of
PfCyp80.9 is encoded by a single very large exon. For
CmCyp48.8, only parts of the coding sequence could be
identified in the available genomic sequences – further
challenging the reliability of the predicted protein
sequence. Therefore, schematic presentation of the
genomic organisation of CmCyp48.8 is not shown in Figure 6.

SYF2 is a nuclear protein described to be involved in splicing of primary transcripts in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggesting a contribution of SYF2-Cyps in RNA
processing. Cyps with an SYF2 domain have not been
identified in higher eukaryotes, however, the CDART tool
[47] retrieves three non-apicomplexan putative protein
sequences with a similar domain architecture from the ciliates

(accession-no.:
[XP_001019212])
and

PPIL6-like Cyp TgCyp36.7
The sequence of TgCyp36.7 has been predicted by the
TwinScan algorithm [48], however, this sequence
(TgTwinScan_3870) is no longer available in the predicted ORFs of the T. gondii genome. Since this is the only
gene prediction from this region of chromosome VII containing the complete Cyp domain, it was nevertheless
included in the analyses though the correct prediction of
the ORF outside the Cyp domain is quite dubious. The

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:27

putative TgCyp36.7 protein (Figure S2 in Additional file
3) is very perculiar in several aspects. First, it does not have
orthologues in any of the other apicomplexan genomes
(Figure 1). Secondly, despite its relatively large size, the
only known protein domain recognized within its
sequence is a Cyp domain. Though the latter clusters
together with Cyp_ABH domains in Figure 1, it is not recognized as this domain subtype by CD-BLAST but only as
general Cyp domain [cd00137]. Thirdly, TgCyp36.7 and
HsPPIL6 form a very significant cluster in the phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 1) indicating that they might be
orthologs. Indeed, size and domain architecture of both
proteins are similar. However, the huge evolutionary distance between TgCyp37.7 and HsPPIL6 – indicated by the
long branch leading to TgCyp36.7 in the phylogram (Figure 1) – severely questions this hypothesis. Currently, no
functional data are available for either PPIL6 or
TgCyp36.7.
Small apicomplexa-specific Cyps
An additional subfamily of relatively small putative Cyps
containing a Cyp_ABH domain can be identified in most
apicomplexan genomes with the exception of C. hominis
and T. annulata (Figures 1 and 6). Since there is also no
evidence for an ortholog from C. muris or Cryptosporidium
parvum sequences, the conclusion that this subfamily was
lost in the genus Cryptosporidium appears to be valid. In
contrast, BLAST analysis indicates the presence of an
orthologous gene on chromosome I of T. annulata though
the coding sequence could not be completely deduced –
maybe due to insufficient sequence quality of the genome
sequence. Domain architecture of this Cyp subfamily (Figure 5) reveals that there is a considerably larger heterogeneity than for the two groups described above. First, the
putative TgCyp31.8 sequence contains an additional
NH2-terminal mitochondrial localization signal as predicted by MitoProtII [44]. Due to the fact that this signal
is only observable in a single species and would indicate a
significant functional difference to its orthologs in other
apicomplexa, careful experimental analyses are needed to
compare localization and function of this group of Cyps
in different apicomplexa. Secondly, TpCyp20.3 is very
small and consists of little more than a Cyp domain, while
BbCyp28.6, PfCyp26.4, and TgCyp31.5 have considerable
COOH-terminal extensions. Functional data on this Cyp
subfamily are completely missing yet. This group of Cyps
has obviously no direct orthologs in mammalian
genomes and appears to be specific for apicomplexa. In
BLASTp analyses, the most closely related non-apicomplexan Cyps appear to be of plant origin (data not shown).
The fact that most of these proteins are predicted to be
cytoplasmic and that they have no orthologs in mammalian hosts makes them an attractive target to develop
drugs such as non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives
that might specifically target this Cyp subfamily.

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/27

PPIH-like Cyps
The PPIH-like Cyps represent another subfamily containing a Cyp_ABH domain that is predicted to be present in
all analyzed apicomplexan genomes (Figures 1 and 7). In
addition to their Cyp domain, these putative proteins
have a short NH2-terminal extension which does not contain any recognizable motifs or domains. Only in
PfCyp24.9 this NH2-terminal region is characterized by its
richness in Asn residues. Though none of the putative apicomplexan PPIH-like Cyps contains any obvious subcellular localization signals, it should be mentioned that
their human ortholog has been described to be located in
the nucleus and to be associated with the splicing machinery [49,50]. Specifically, HsPPIH is able to interact independently with the factors HsPrp3 and HsPrp4 that both
integrate into the U4/U6 di-snRNP particle. The bindingsite of HsPrp3 and HsPrp4 for HsPPIH is highly homologous, and binding does not need enzymatic activity of
PPIH since it is not impaired by the presence of CsA.
PPIH-like Cyps are highly conserved between apicomplexa, fungi and mammals suggesting that the apicomplexan orthologs might carry out similar functions as well.
FCBP proteins
The next multi-domain Cyp subfamily to be described
here are the recently identified FCBP proteins [28] which
contain two phylogenetically unrelated PPIase domains,
i.e. an FK506-binding domain (FKBP) at the NH2-terminus and a Cyp_ABH type domain in the COOH-terminus
(Figure 8). Between these two enzymatic domains, there
are three tetratricopeptide repeat domains (TRP)
[cd00189] which are typically involved in protein/protein
interactions and might contribute to recruitment of specific substrates for FCBP proteins.

Isomerase and chaperone activity have been demonstrated for both PPIase domains of TgFCBP57.3 and the
inhibitors FK506 and CsA can suppress activity of the
FKBP and Cyp domain, respectively [28]. Moreover,
Adams et al. [28] could show that only the complex of the
FKBP domain with FK506 but not the complex of the Cyp
domain with CsA was able to inhibit T. gondii calcineurin
protein phosphatase activity. Although a weakly synergistic inhibitory effect of FK506 and CsA on parasite growth
was noted, this must not necessarily be due to action of
TgFCBP57.3 but can also involve any of the other Cyp or
FKBP proteins expressed by T. gondii. More convincing as
a first hint for an important role of FCBPs in the physiology of apicomplexa is the fact that suppression of
TgCyp57.3 expression by RNA interference results in

species (Figures 1 and 8). In all four apicomplexan FCBP
proteins, the enzymatically active domains are separated
by TRP repeats. Conspicuously, BLASTp and tBLASTn
analyses of protein and nucleic acid databases as well as
the CDART tool reveal that putative proteins containing
both a Cyp and a FKBP domain are present even in very
distantly related organisms such as bacteria [5,28] (see
Tables S2 and S3 in Additional file 4 in the supplemental
online material for accession-no.). Furthermore, putative
FCBP proteins can also be identified in the ciliophora T.
thermophila and P. tetraurelia (Figure S3 in Additional file
5). Since ciliophora and apicomplexa are considered to be
phylogenetically related and are usually placed together
with dinoflagellates in the infrakingdom alveolata [51],
this finding suggests that FCBP proteins were already
present in their common ancestors. This hypothesis is also
supported by the fact that the deduced FCBPs of ciliophora are also separated by TRP repeats. However, at least
the putative TtFCBP131.6 appears to have evolved new or
additional functions, since this protein exhibits the presence of an additional (though incomplete) NTPase
domain in its very long NH2-terminus. Such an NTPase
domain can be found neither in its homologs in Paramecium nor in the apicomplexan FCBPs. An alternative
explanation for the large NH2-terminus might be an
incorrect prediction of the intron/exon structure resulting
in fusion of two adjacent but distinct genes in the database entry. An important argument for the latter hypothesis is the incompleteness and therefore presumably nonfunctionality of the NTPase domain in the predicted
sequence of TtFCBP131.6.
Putative FCBPs can also be identified in the oomycete Phytophora capsici, the green algae O. tauri (chlorophyta) and
in archaebacteria (Figure S3 in Additional file 5). Whereas
PcaFCBP52.5 also contains a Cyp_ABH domain, the Cyp
domains in O. tauri CPR7 is truncated and therefore only
recognized as Cyp superfamily (accession-no.: [cl00197]).
In both predicted archaebacterial FCBPs, CD-BLAST identifies only a Cyp domain without further specification
(accession-no.: [cd00317]). In contrast to PcaCyp52.5,
neither OtCPR7 nor the archaebacterial FKBPs do contain
TRP repeats separating the two PPIase domains (Figure
S3). Finally, it should be mentioned that the OtCPR7
sequence might be COOH-terminally truncated since the
Cyp domain itself is truncated. In contrast to all other
FCBP proteins identified here, OtCPR7 contains an NH2terminal mitochondrial localization signal as predicted
with high significance by both PSORT II [52] and MitoProt II.
There are also several putative dual-family immunophilins with an NH2-terminal Cyp and a COOH-terminal
FKBP domain in proteo- and flavobacteria as well as in
spirochaeta (Figure S3). Here, these proteins are called

CFBPs, and they do not contain any TRP repeats. All these
putative bacterial CFBPs are very similar in size and
domain architecture, however, Borrellia hermsii CFBP38
has a prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment
site (Prosite accession-no.: [PS51257]) at its immediate
NH2-terminus as identified by InterProScan suggesting
that BhCFBP38 is exported by the bacterium. The domain
architecture of all non-apicomplexan FCBPs and some
representative CFBPs are shown in Figure S3.
The discontinuous distribution pattern of FCBPs and
CFBPs in phylogenetically unrelated clades raises the
question whether these proteins evolved multiple times
independently. Alternatively, a common evolutionary origin of proteins with this domain architecture might be
assumed followed by either loss from most genomes or
horizontal gene transfer. In order to address this question,
BLAST analyses were used to identify those Cyps and
FKBPs in archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes that
show the highest similarity to the diverse FCBPs and
CFBPs. All proteins used for these analyses are listed in

Tables S2 and S3 in Additional file 4. Then, maximum
likelihood analyses were performed independently on
ClustalW2-built alignments of Cyp and FKBP domains.
Results of these phylogenetic analyses are presented in
Figure 9. The cyclophilin domains of all eukaryotic FCBPs
are closely related (i.e. most of them are recognized as
Cyp_ABH domain by CD-BLAST) and therefore form a
highly significant cluster in Figure 9A (group in the dendrogram with blue background). However, they are
clearly not monophyletic as there are several non-FCBP
Cyps within this group and FCBP proteins have apparently evolved at least three times independently – i.e. in
chlorophyta, oomycetes and alveolata. For OtCPR7 this
conclusion is further supported by the fact that this FCBP
does not contain any TRP repeats. Cyp domains of the
putative archaebacterial FCBPs are not even closely related
to this group and form a completely independent cluster.
The Cyp domains of proteo-/flavobacterial CFBP proteins
are monophyletic – in contrast to those of spirochaetes.
However, for the latter group there are currently only
members known from Treponema denticula and four Borre-

lia species. It is for instance possible that one of these two
proteins is highly divergent from the average spirochaete
CFBP due to secondary evolutionary changes. In particular, the presence of a lipoprotein anchor at the NH2-terminus of BhCFBP38 suggests an extracellular localization of
the mature protein and therefore a significantly altered
function.
The Cyp domains of FCBPs of ciliophora and apicomplexa are closely related, surprisingly, however, a non-FKBP
Cyp from the rhodophyte Griffithsia japonica is proposed
to be a member of the same cluster as revealed by maximum likelihood analysis. Since red algae are frequently
supposed to be the evolutionary origin of the apicoplast,
one explanation for this result may be that the Cyp
domain of FKBPs in alveolata was derived from the
genome of a rhodophyte-related secondary endosymbiont.
Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced FCBP domains does
also not support a monophylic origin of alveolate FCBPs.
Overall, phylogenetic distances between FKBP domains
are much larger than for Cyp domains (compare scale bar
between Figures 9A and 9B) indicating that the latter are
far better conserved. Moreover, the phylogram reveals
poor sequence conservation even within groups containing a well conserved Cyp domain. For instance, the CFBPs
of proteo-/flavobacteria do not form a monophyletic
group when FKBP domains are analyzed (Figure 9B). The
two spirochaete CFBPs are clearly separated and the green
algal OtCPR7 does not show any close relationship with
FKBP domains from other eukaryotic FCBPs but appears
to be closely related to bacterial FKBPs suggesting that it
might have been acquired from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont. Though the FKBP domains of all alveolat
FCBPs can be found in the same highly significant cluster
(group with blue background), this group also contains
non-FCBP FKBPs. Conspicuously, however, all FKBP proteins within this group also contain TRP repeats (compare
Figures 8, S3, 9B, and Table S3). In contrast to the results
obtained for Cyp domains, not even the FKBP domains of
FCBPs from ciliophora and apicomplexa appear to be
monophyletic. On one hand, it is quite unlikely that the
same structure of FKBP domain and Cyp domain connected by TRP repeats arose multiple times independently
and it can therefore be suspected that this result is due to
high and diversifying evolutionary pressure on FKBP
domains in this protein family. On the other hand, there
is a widely distributed monophyletic family of FKBP proteins with TRP repeats. These proteins might indeed have
captured a Cyp domain several times independently. The
strongest argument for the latter evolutionary pathway is
the presence of putative FKBP proteins with TRP repeats
and a concurrent absence of predicted FCBP proteins in all
Plasmodium species. If FCBP proteins would be a monophyletic, ancient group in alveolata or at least in apicom-

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/27

plexa, secondary loss of the Cyp domain from FCBPs
restoring the ancient FKBP/TRP protein has to be postulated for Plasmodium.
In summary, additional data from more species are
needed to draw a conclusive pattern of evolution for FCBP
proteins in protists. Currently, there are hints supporting
either a monophyletic origin or multiple independent origins though the latter option appears to be slightly more
likely.
Cyps with WD40 repeats
The first group of putative Cyps with a non-Cyp_ABH
domain is represented by the WD40 repeat-containing
Cyps which are encoded in all apicomplexan genomes
analyzed here (Figure 1). This subfamily contains multidomain Cyps with a Cyp_WD40 domain (CD accessionno: [cd01927]) in its COOH-terminus (Figure 10). WD40
domains (CD accession no.: [cl02567]) are characterized
by repeats of about 40 amino acids containing a characteristic Trp/Asp dipeptide. The length of the deduced WD40
domain ranges from 145 amino acids in P. falciparum to
321 and 328 amino acids in C. hominis and T. gondii,
respectively. The WD40 repeat domain is either located
close to the NH2-terminus as in Theileria species and in B.
bovis, or is preceded by a longer NH2-terminal extension
without identifiable domains or motifs as in T. gondii, P.
falciparum, and C. hominis. There is no sequence similarity
between the orthologs within this region. In T. gondii,
however, a nuclear localization signal can be found here,
and in P. falciparum there are two short stretches rich in
Asn and Lys, respectively. An orthologous protein from E.
tenella has recently been described to contain a very Serand His-rich NH2-terminus [29].

The genomic organization differs largely between species
with intronless genes in C. hominis and P. falciparum while
there are between 6 (B. bovis) and 12 introns (T. gondii) in
the other species.
Deckert et al. [53] showed that the human WD40-repeat
Cyp is a component of the spliceosomal B complex which
contains the complete set of U snRNAs in a precatalytic
state. However, its precise role in splicing or regulation of
splicing has not been addressed yet. Recent structural
analyses show that – in the crystal – the NH2-terminus of
the protein binds to the active site of a neighboring molecule in a substrate-analogous manner [54]. Binding of this
sequence to the active center without subsequent isomerization was also confirmed by NMR solution studies.
PPIL1-like Cyps
For Cyps of the PPIL1/SpCyp2 subfamily, CD-BLAST does
not recognize any special Cyp domain but only the Cyp
superfamily in general (accession-no.: [cl00197]). Only
two putative members of this subfamily can be found in

the apicomplexan genomes analyzed here, i.e. TgCyp21
and PfCyp23.2 (Figure 1 and Figure S4 in Additional file
6). PfCyp23.2 is also predicted to have an NH2-terminal
coiled-coil region. However, there is no hint for such a
domain in other PPIL1-like Cyps such as TgCyp21 or
SpCyp2.
HsPPIL1 has been demonstrated to be a part of the spliceosomal machinery [38] and to directly interact with the
highly conserved transcriptional cofactor SKIP [55].
Although PPIL1-like Cyps are widely spread, they are for
instance missing in a large number of fungal genomes [9]
indicating that the function of this subfamily is not essential. Since SKIP is also involved in splicing and remains
bound to the spliceosome throughout both trans-esterification steps [55], PPIL1-like Cyps and SKIP might be

involved in the complex linkage of transcription and
splicing during mRNA processing.
PPIL3-like Cyps
Within the non Cyp_ABH group, the PPIL3-like Cyps are
the only subfamily of small single domain Cyps that is
widely distributed among apicomplexa. PPIL3-like Cyps
can be predicted in all the apicomplexan genomes and
consist of little more than the Cyp_PPIL3 domain (accession-no.: [cd01928]) itself (Figures 1 and 11). Since
apparent localization signals are missing, a predominant
cytosolic localization of the putative proteins might be
assumed. However, at least one splice form of human
PPIL3 has been identified as part of the B complex of the
spliceosome in the nucleus [38] though its precise role in
the spliceosome B complex has not been analyzed yet.

Page 17 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:27

In contrast to the PPIA-like subfamily, the major subfamily of small cytosolic Cyps, most of the PPIL3-like
Cyps are encoded by genes consisting of four (P. falciparum) to six (B. bovis) exons (Figure 11). In this case, the
only exception is ChCyp18.9, which has an intronless
coding sequence.
PPIL2-like Cyps
Putative PPIL2-like Cyps form a very robust phylogenetic
cluster (Figure 1) and are characterized by the presence of
a so-called RING finger domain that has been reported to
facilitate E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity [56]. Cyps with RING
finger motif in their NH2-terminus are widely spread
among different organisms including fungi, plants and
mammals, and the Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog,
AtPUB49, has been shown to be an active E3 ubiquitinligase and to exhibit PPIase and chaperone activity suggesting that it is involved in protein folding and degradation processes. The Cyp_RING domain (accession-no:
[cd01923]) is present in the vicinity of the COOH-terminus (Figure 12). This subfamily is apparently missing in
the genomes of P. falciparum and C. hominis. The deduced
sequence of TgCyp72.9 is somewhat larger than its
orthologs in Theileria and Babesia (between 58.8 and 59.4
kDa) due to a longer COOH-terminus. Moreover,
TgCyp72.9 contains a putative nuclear localization signal
which is not present in its haemosporidian orthologs.

The genomic organization of Cyps with RING finger
domain again shows signs of intron-loss during evolution
with eight introns in T. gondii, one intron in both Theileria
species and no intron left in B. bovis.
CeCyp16-like Cyps
In contrast to most other moderate to large size Cyps, the
subfamily containing a Cyp-CeCyp16-like domain (accession number: [cd01925]) does not contain any additional
domain that could be identified by CD-BLAST or InterProScan (Figure 13). However, there is a nuclear localization
signal detectable in all putative apicomplexan CeCyp16like Cyps, which is located in approximately the same distance from the Cyp domain in all subfamily members
with the exception of TgCyp64.5 where it immediately
follows the Cyp domain. Moreover, using PSORTII at least
one coiled-coil protein-protein interaction domain can be
identified in all these proteins but CmCyp43.1 (for
CmCyp43.1 the score for a coiled-coil region is only
slightly too small to be judged as significant by PSORTII).
PfCyp51.8 is even predicted to contain two coiled-coil
regions. Moreover, PfCyp51.8 has a large Lys-rich region
encompassing both coiled-coil domains. A comparable
but much smaller positively charged region consisting of
a large number of Arg residues is present in TgCyp64.5.

The C. elegans ortholog CeCyp16 has been shown to be
expressed predominantly in the intestine [57] and hightroughput RNAi screening experiments revealed strong
phenotyps for CeCyp16 including lethality, embryonic
lethality, morphological abnormalities and maternal sterility [58,59] indicating that this subfamily of Cyps is very
important at least in multi-cellular organisms. However,
since CeCyp16 is much smaller than its apicomplexan
orthologs and most of the latter miss a clearly definable
positively charged domain in their COOH-terminus that
can be found in nematode CeCyp16-like proteins [57], it
is not yet possible to draw any conclusions regarding the
function of CeCyp16-like Cyps in apicomplexa. Even certain biochemical observations made on recombinant
CeCyp16-like proteins from the nematodes C. elegans and
Onchocerca volvolus cannot simply be extended to their
ortologs in apicomplexa. In particular, although both
nematode and apicomplaxan CeCyp16-like Cyps reveal
absence of an otherwise highly conserved Trp residue in
the active center of the enzyme, there are acidic residues in
this position in nematode CeCyp16-like proteins but a
wide variety of different amino acids residues in CeCyp16like Cyps of apicomplexa including Gln, Val, Tyr, Cys, and

S5 in Additional file 7). Although orthologs are present in
other Cryptosporidium species (data not shown) and many
but not all genomes of fungi [9], this subfamily is apparently absent from all other apicomplexan genomes analyzed. ChCyp34.5, just like its orthologs SpCyp6 and
HsPPIL4, contains an RRM (RNA recognition motif)
closer to its COOH-terminus and a Cyp_RRM domain
(accession-no.: [cd01921]) in its immediate NH2-terminus (Figure S5). In contrast to other PPIL4-like Cyps, the
deduced sequence of ChCyp34.5 is missing a Ser/Arg-rich
SR domain in its COOH-terminus. The predicted
sequence of TgCyp66.3 is very unusual since it contains a
Cyp domain that is interrupted by a large insertion which
remains to be confirmed experimentally. However, in
contrast to ChCyp34.5, TgCyp66.2 is more typical for
PPIL2-like Cyps since it possesses a Ser-rich and highly
positively charged domain in its COOH-terminus.
Although it also contains multiple Lys in addition to Arg
residues, it can be assumed that this domain fulfills a
function similar to that of the SR domain of mammalian
and fungal PPIL4-like Cyps. It is not unlikely that both
ChCyp34.5 and TgCyp66.3 are not yet predicted accurately (e.g. a missing exon in ChCyp34.5 and a missing
intron in TgCyp66.3 would explain the current results)
and it will finally turn out that both possess normal Cyp
domains and an SR domain.

PPIL4-like Cyps should not be confused with the PPIElike Cyps, a subfamily that is missing in all apicomplexan
genomes. PPIE-like Cyps contain an RRM motif in the
NH2-terminus and a Cyp_ABH domain in their COOHterminus.
ChCyp34.5 contains a nuclear localization signal within
its Cyp domain and PSORTII predicts a nuclear localization. Due to its high content of positively charged amino
acid residues, the putative TgCyp66.3 is predicted to have
a multitude of overlapping nuclear localization signals in
its COOH terminus in addition to one signal about 100
amino acids away from its NH2-terminus. Indeed, the
orthologous AtCyp59 protein from A. thaliana has been
described to be localized in the nucleus but outside of
those nuclear speckles rich in SR domain proteins [60].

implicated in RNA splicing could be demonstrated using
yeast-two-hybrid and pull-down assays, the punctuate
nuclear localization pattern and a measurable interaction
with the COOH-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II
suggest that AtCyp59 predominantly participates in transcriptional processes and that it is only marginally
involved in splicing [60]. It is still too early to speculate
whether PPIL2-like Cyps of apicomplexa have similar
functions as AtCyp59 or other PPIL2-like Cyps since the
SR domain responsible for all known AtCyp59 interactions is missing in ChCyp34.5 and the Cyp domain of
TgCyp66.3 might well be non-functional. In this context
it is also noteworthy that the Cyp domain of this protein
is less conserved than that of other PPIL4-like Cyps.

Whereas this domain in SpCyp6 and HsPPIL4 is recognized as Cyp_RRM domain (accession no.: [cd01921]),
CD-Blast only recognizes a domain belonging to the Cyp
superfamily (accession no.: [cd00197]). It is also possible
that the truncated or disrupted PPIL4-like Cyps in Cryptosporidia and Toxoplasma containing a slightly degenerated
Cyp domain represent transition states that ultimately led
to complete loss of this gene in other apicomplexa.
Genomic organization of Cyp genes
Loss of introns during evolution of organisms exhibiting
a parasitic live mode such as Giardia [61], Trypanosoma
[62], Trichomonas [63], and Encephalitozoon [64] has
been recognized previously and has also been described
Page 20 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:27

for apicomplexan parasites on a genome wide scale [65].
While Toxoplasma is known to have a genomic organization with a very high number of about five introns on
average per gene, Theileria and Plasmodium species have
approximately two and one intron on average per gene.
Only a very small number of introns can be found in the
genomes of Cryptosporidium species which have introns
in only about 5% of their genes. However, most of the few
remaining introns in Cryptosporidium genomes are not
conserved to T. gondii introns and are therefore supposed
to be not of ancient origin [65]. Apparently, loss of introns
occurred independently in the lineages leading to cryptoand haemosporidia.
As expectable from the differences in the general genomic
organization, the exon/intron structure of Cyp genes varies widely between species. The number of introns per
Cyp gene, i.e. 0.5 for C. hominis, 4.5 for T. gondii, 2.0 for P.
falciparum, 3.1 for T. parva, 3.5 for T. annulata, and 2.8 for
B. bovis is very similar to that observed on the genome
scale. Despite this overall similarity, however, there are
some remarkable exeptions from the general pattern:
First, the putative ChCyp22.9 with SP in C. hominis shows
a conserved position of introns in comparison to its
ortholog in T. gondii. Secondly, some Cyp subfamilies
have a high number of introns in both haemosporidians
and T. gondii although only minimal conservation of
introns can be observed. This group includes the small
apicomplexa-specific cyclophilins, the Cyps with WD40
repeats (with exception of PfCyp87), and the PPIL3-like
Cyps. Finally, there is one Cyp gene subfamily, the
CeCyp16-like Cyps, showing a completely reversed trend
with more introns in the haemosporidian genomes than
in T. gondii. Since several of the introns in haemosporidia
appear to be of ancient origin, it is most likely that
TgCyp65.5 has lost its introns since divergence from the
last common anchestor with the haemosporidia.
In summary, though the trend of moderate and nearly
complete loss of introns observed on a genome-wide scale
for haemo- and cryptosporidia, respectively, could also be
observed for Cyp genes in general, there are exceptions to
this rule in certain subfamilies that might be exploited in
the future to decipher the selection forces that contribute
to conservation of certain introns despite high overall frequency of intron loss. For instance, it would be highly
intriguing to look for any functional roles for the three
introns in ChCyp22.9 (e.g. on regulation of gene expression) that might explain counterselection against their
deletion during evolution.

Conclusion
The present study was able to identify 16 different Cyp
subfamilies in apicomplexa. While some of these subfamilies can be found in the genomes of all species analyzed, there are also two small subfamilies, that can only

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/27

be found in the genus Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma
(PPIL4-like Cyps) or even only in Toxoplasma (PPIL6-like
Cyps), respectively. Six out of these 16 subfamilies (i.e.
PPIH-like, SYF2-containing, WD40-containing, PPIL-3like, PPIL-4-like, and PPIL-1-like Cyps) have been
described to be a part of the extremely complex transcription and/or splicing machinery in mammalian or yeast
cells indicating that regulation of protein conformation in
these very large protein or ribonucleoprotein complexes
catalyzing RNA processing is a highly conserved major
function of eukaryotic Cyps.
While most apicomplexa are predicted to posses typical
cytoplasmic PPIA-like Cyps, these putative proteins in
both Theileria species are predicted to have an NH2-terminal apicoplast localization signal. Surprisingly, these are
the only Cyps that are predicted to be transported to the
apicoplast. Apicomplexa might be more easily able to
cope with loss of cytosolic PPIA-like proteins than other
eukaryota since members of the apicomplexa-specific
group of relatively small Cyps with Cyp_ABH domain
might be able to functionally replace PPIA-like cytosolic
Cyps. Moreover, at least one member of the Cyp subfamily with signal peptides has been reported not to be
confined to the secretory pathway but to be present in the
cytosol as well [24]. This Cyp subfamily is very closely
related to cytosolic PPIA-like Cyps and therefore unique
in so far as it does not represent orthologs of the PPIB-like
subfamily that is present in the secretory pathway of other
eukaryotes.
Since the Cyp antagonist CsA has been shown to have
anti-parasitc activity against a wide variety of apicomplexa
[13,16,17,19,20], Cyps represent an attractive target for
the identification of new drugs against this important
group of pathogens. These might either include nonimmunosuppressive CsA derivatives or completely new,
structurally unrelated agents. Systematic identification
and characterization of the apicomplexan Cyp repertoire
as commenced in this bioinformatic survey will enable
future analysis of suitable drug targets in more detail. The
encouraging fact that there are Cyp subfamilies that are
absent from their mammalian hosts, such as Cyps with
signal peptides, small apicomplexa-specific Cyps, Plasmodium-specific Cyps, and Cyps with SYF2 domain, already
points out obvious drug target candidates.

Methods
Identification of Cyp genes
Initially, putative apicomplexan Cyps were identified
using BLASTp and tBLASTn algorithms to search in GenBank® protein and nucleic acid databases as well as in PlasmoDB, ToxoDB, CryptoDB, and in the Theileria parva
genome database of TIGR. S. pombe Cyp1 and Cyp2 were
used as query sequences. These Cyps were chosen because
they are not closely related. If a Cyp subfamily member
Page 21 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:27

was not identified in one of the apicomplexan organisms,
a Cyp of the same subfamily from a closely related apicomplexan parasite was used as query to search in protein,
cDNA, EST and genome databases. This method ensures
that no Cyps are missed in any of the taxa. In order to prevent that no complete subfamilies was overseen, BLAST
analyses were also performed using the complete T. gondii
Cyp repertoire as a query. However, no additional Cyp
sequences could be identified.
In contrast to conventional nomenclature for many Cyps,
molecular mass suffixes in the names were given with one
position after the decimal point since otherwise identical
names would have resulted in a few cases. It was decided
not to use suffix letters to avoid a possible confusion with
mammalian Cyps. For instance, a Cyp19A might have
been confused with a human CypA/PPIA. In addition it
should be mentioned that all molecular mass suffixes
used have been derived from the predicted sequence of
unprocessed proteins. Although this can currently be only
a provisional nomenclature, consecutive naming with
numbers or letters would result in different names for
orthologues Cyps and identical names for unrelated Cyps
of different apicomplexa. A more function based nomenclature of apicomplexan Cyps should be introduced later,
when at least for one apicomplexan genome all Cyps have
been verified experimentally. For human and S. pombe
Cyps, names according to the entries in the ENSEMBL
database were used.
Phylogenetic analyses
Homologous putative protein sequences were aligned
using ClustalW2 [33]. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic
trees were then calculated with PhyML [34] using the
approximate likelihood ratio test option and the JTT
model [66] for amino acid substitution. The program was
set to estimate the proportion of invariable sites and the
gamma distribution parameter, while the number of substitution rate categories was set to four. The input tree was
built using the BIONJ algorithm implemented in PhyML.
The resulting trees in Newick format were visualized and
processed using MEGA4 [67,68].
Identification of protein domains
For identification of protein domains, CD-BLAST [31,32]
and InterPro Scan [69] were used. Moreover, protein
sequences were scanned for subcellular localization signals with PSORT, SignalP [70], PATS [40], PlasMit
[45,71], and Mitoprot [44].
