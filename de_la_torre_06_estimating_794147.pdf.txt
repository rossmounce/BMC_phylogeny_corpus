Abstract
Background: While Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) have proven a viable and efficient way to
sample genomes, particularly those for which whole-genome sequencing is impractical,
phylogenetic analysis using ESTs remains difficult. Sequencing errors and orthology determination
are the major problems when using ESTs as a source of characters for systematics. Here we
develop methods to incorporate EST sequence information in a simultaneous analysis framework
to address controversial phylogenetic questions regarding the relationships among the major
groups of seed plants. We use an automated, phylogenetically derived approach to orthology
determination called OrthologID generate a phylogeny based on 43 process partitions, many of
which are derived from ESTs, and examine several measures of support to assess the utility of EST
data for phylogenies.
Results: A maximum parsimony (MP) analysis resulted in a single tree with relatively high support
at all nodes in the tree despite rampant conflict among trees generated from the separate analysis
of individual partitions. In a comparison of broader-scale groupings based on cellular compartment
(ie: chloroplast, mitochondrial or nuclear) or function, only the nuclear partition tree (based largely
on EST data) was found to be topologically identical to the tree based on the simultaneous analysis
of all data. Despite topological conflict among the broader-scale groupings examined, only the tree
based on morphological data showed statistically significant differences.
Conclusion: Based on the amount of character support contributed by EST data which make up
a majority of the nuclear data set, and the lack of conflict of the nuclear data set with the
simultaneous analysis tree, we conclude that the inclusion of EST data does provide a viable and
efficient approach to address phylogenetic questions within a parsimony framework on a genomic
scale, if problems of orthology determination and potential sequencing errors can be overcome. In
addition, approaches that examine conflict and support in a simultaneous analysis framework allow
for a more precise understanding of the evolutionary history of individual process partitions and
may be a novel way to understand functional aspects of different kinds of cellular classes of gene
products.

Conflicting Phylogenetic Hypotheses involving the seed plants
Conflicting Phylogenetic Hypotheses involving the seed plants. Morphological evidence (synapomophic characterstics
shared between angiosperms and Gnetales) have shaped the anthophyte theory, where these two taxa form sister groups
(Panel A; [1, 2, 5]). In contrast, most molecular studies postulate gymnosperms as a monophyletic group sister to all
angiosperms, and place the Gnetales as a sister group to the conifers (Panels B and D; [7–9, 15, 16]). Adding to the controversy, a recent study involving phytochrome genes ([13]; Panel D) has placed the Gnetales as basal gymnosperms, with Ginkgo
and cycads as sister taxa branching after the Coniferales.

Background
Higher order Spermatophyte phylogeny: an unresolved
systematics problem
In this paper, we discuss the utility of incorporating EST
data to address one of the more important plant phylogenetic questions concerning the hierarchical relationships
of the several major seed plant lineages (angiosperms,
Cycadales, Gingkoales, Gnetales and Coniferales). Phylogenetic relationships among seed plant groups have
remained controversial, despite attempts to resolve Spermatophyte phylogeny using numerous character sources,
both morphological [1-6] and molecular [7-13]. There is
a wide range of phylogenetic hypotheses that have been
put forward in answer to this systematic question (see Fig.
1). Conflicting results in datasets from different sources
have added to the problem. Based on morphological evidence, synapomophic characterstics shared between
angiosperms and Gnetales have shaped the anthophyte

theory, in which Gnetales form a sister group to the
angiosperms (Fig. 1A; [1,2,5]). These synapomorphies
include the presence of vessel elements, double fertilization, a double integument, and a reduction or loss of
archegonia [14].
In contrast, the majority of molecular phylogenies have
postulated the gymnosperms to be a monophyletic group
sister to all angiosperms. Most molecular studies place the
Gnetales as a sister group to the conifers (Fig. 1B; [79,15,16]). However, some molecular evidence can also be
interpreted as supporting the anthophyte theory [17].
Attempts to associate molecular expression data with
morphological structures (e.g. [18]) also place the Gnetales and conifers together, with shared expression of
orthologous genes indicating that the Gnetum strobilar
collar and ovule are homologous to the conifer bract-andovule/ovuliferous scale complex. Adding to the contro-

versy, a recent study involving phytochrome genes (Fig.
1D; [13]) has placed the Gnetales as basal gymnosperms,
with Ginkgoales and Cycadales as sister groups branching
after the Coniferales. No recent combined analyses of
molecular and morphological data have been produced
and a very early one was equivocal [19]. In the past this
question has been addressed with a single partition and
more recently with eight [16] and thirteen partitions [20].
To our knowledge as of yet no general consensus has been
reached as to the phylogenetic arrangement of these six
major seed plant lineages. In fact the Tree of Life website
for Spermatophytes [22] resolves only two nodes involving the five relevant taxa listed above. In the tree of life
study, Gnetales are shown as the sister group to
angiosperms, yet the difference between the Gnetales as
the sister group to the angiosperms versus a monophyletic
gymnoperms with cycads sister to other gymnosperms
requires a very different set of morphological concepts
and transformations. For example, are carpels leaves with
marginal ovules or are they subtending leaves with axillary ovules? These are very different and mutually exclusive scenarios. Consequently, attempts to understand the
genes involved in the innovations achieved by the
angiosperms are severely hampered.

number of plant genomes have been fully sequenced in
recent years (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus
trichocarpa), limited time and resources make it difficult to
sequence genomes of every living species. In some cases
where genome size is very large (as is the case for most
gymnosperms), the task becomes extremely impractical. A
viable alternative is to sample the genome of such species
through EST sequencing [31]. A number of EST sequencing projects, many in species from the more basal seed
plant groups (e.g. [32-38]), have significantly increased
the amount of available seed plant sequences in recent
years (Fig 2).

It is clear from the literature on seed plant phylogenetics
that the addition of information relevant to the seed
plants may be a viable way to solve this difficult problem.
In addition, many studies on other taxa have demonstrated that the simultaneous analysis of multiple data
partitions can result in an increase in overall branch support, despite conflict among the characters, due to emergent properties not evident in the separate analyses of
individual data partitions [23-27]. An additional positive
aspect of adding process partitions to an analysis is that
once a large number of partitions from various cellular
functional classes are available, partitioned analysis will
also allow detailed examination of the evolutionary
dynamics of these classes of genes. The latter advantage
may shed light on the role of certain genes in organismal
evolution.

Sequencing errors and orthology determination pose
challenges to the use of ESTs as a source of characters for
systematics. There can be a high rate of sequencing error
in raw EST data, since it is derived from single pass reads.
A strategy to minimize this problem is contig assembly
and EST clustering using several reads at every region (e.g.
[39,40]). In our approach, a minimum of 10 reads were
used to determine each EST sequence. While orthology
assessment is difficult in sub-genomic studies such as ones
that use PCR or gene cloning approaches to obtain
sequences, one can enhance orthology assessment in such
studies by careful design of primers, and by referring to
the whole genome sequences of closely related model taxa
as guides for assessing orthology. Assessing orthology of
ESTs is more difficult, because of the inaccuracy that
accompanies EST analysis and by the possibility that some
desired orthologs are not expressed or expressed at low
levels. We determined the orthology of EST sequences
using a tree-building approach. Initially this was accomplished by including ESTs in the gene tree analysis for
each gene family. Without automation, this approach
would be prohibitively time consuming and labor intensive and would greatly restrict the use of genomic-scale
EST data in phylogenetic analyses. Therefore, during the
course of this study, we developed automated methods
for orthology determination within a parsimony framework, described elsewhere [41] (see also Methods section
below for an overview).

The (phylogenetic) trouble with ESTs
Genome level analyses have expanded our view of phylogenetics in many areas of the tree of life. With the production of whole genome DNA sequences of several taxa and
large-scale EST databases as well as the incorporation of
other genome enhanced technologies [27-30], a large
number of candidate genes for inclusion into phylogenetic analysis have become available. In this report we utilize genome databases and explore the utility of including
data from several new EST studies to increase the number
of process partitions that can be used to address this difficult question in plant phylogenetics, as well as others
regarding seed plant evolutionary relationships. While a

Why partition? Hidden support and phylogenetic inference
Studies with large numbers of process partitions in a dataset exist [23,26,42-48], and some of these have attempted
to address higher phylogenetic questions of mammals,
yeast and bacteria by taking advantage of genomic level
approaches. These large data set approaches can be
divided into whole-genome approaches (mostly microbial) and "subgenomic" [49] approaches. The wholegenome approach has the obvious advantage that orthology assessment is made with more certainty and ease
when whole genome sequences are used in a phylogenetic
analysis. Such is the case in a study of the relationships of
seven ingroup yeast species with whole genomes

sequenced [26] and much of the whole genome bacterial
phylogenetic studies that are beginning to appear in the
literature [44,45]. The yeast study is particularly interesting in that the authors approached the very question of
where in sequence analysis space we need to be to resolve
phylogenies with robustness, Using 106 carefully chosen
orthologous genes they showed that > 20 genes or > 15 kb
of sequence produced a plateau of robustness at measures
of 100% for conventionally used detectors of node
robustness (bootstrapping; [50]) in phylogenetics. In
addition, they showed that despite rampant incongruence
(as typified by the large number of single gene trees that
disagree in topology amongst the 106 single gene trees
that can be produced), combining gene partitions into a
concatenated or simultaneous analysis [51,52] was always
the best way to analyze the sequence information in a
phylogenetic context.

Implementing a different node support measure [23] than
the ones used in the yeast study, DeSalle [53] demonstrated that this phenomenon is the result of hidden support in the various gene partitions included in the
analysis. Hidden support [23] is simply the amount of
support at a node that is NOT found in the separate gene
partitions analyzed individually. All character partitions
have either positive, neutral or negative latent support for
any given phylogenetic hypothesis, that becomes evident
only after combining or concatenating data partitions and
performing a simultaneous analysis of all available data.
An assessment of hidden support using the yeast dataset
of Rokas et al. [26] reveals that one in every five characters
that support the simultaneous analysis (SA) tree is hidden
[53]. This large amount of hidden support for the nodes
in the SA tree, suggests that interaction of character information is an important concept in reconstructing phylo-

genetic relationships. More importantly quantifying
hidden support can enlighten researchers about the
degree of positive or negative interaction of characters in
a concatenated analysis that can help determine "next
steps" in phylogenetic studies. Hidden support and partitioned analyses can also aid in determining the effects of
missing data and the congruence of particular partitions
with an overall phylogenetic hypothesis. Issues arising
from missing data are especially problematic with EST
phylogenetic studies and are caused by two factors. First,
in EST studies partial gene sequences are more frequently
reported than full length cDNA sequences; and second,
because of the random nature of clones in EST libraries
often times orthologs are not found in all taxa in the
study. An exploration of the amount of support contributed by each partition to the simultaneous analysis tree
can aid in determining the effect of these two kinds of
missing data on overall phylogenetic hypotheses.

Results
Phylogenetic analyses and support
We constructed a matrix composed of 42 gene regions
consisting of mitochondrial (6), chloroplast (16) and
nuclear (20, including 19 ESTs) protein and DNA (18S
rDNA) sequences. In addition, we included a morphological partition with 167 characters scored for the taxa in our
study. The morphological matrix was developed for this
study by coding morphological characters for Physcomitrella but otherwise follows the morphological matrix
used in previous studies [3,5,54]. A list of all the gene
regions, and the accession numbers of all sequences used
in the analysis, [see Additional file 1], the matrix used in
the analysis [see Additional file 2] and a list of the morphological characters and character-state names [see Additional file 2] are provided. A phylogenetic analysis of the
combined multiple data partitions using exhaustive tree
searches resulted in a single most parsimonious tree. Figure 3 shows the result of phylogenetic analysis of these six
seed plant ingroups rooted with Physcomitrella. This
hypothesis of relationships, showing gymnosperms as a
monophyletic group sister to the angiosperms, is also

Topological incongruence of individual process partitions with the SA tree. The figure is a summary of bootstrap
consensus trees (> 75% support) of individual (42 genes + morphology on red background) and broader (cell compartments on
blue background; functional categories on yellow background) data partitions. Wide topological disagreement exists, as only
one of the individual gene partitions (5, ribosomal protein S7) agrees with the simultaneous analysis (SA) tree. In broader partitions, only the nuclear data analysed together agrees with the SA tree at all nodes. Numbers in boxes indicate data partitions
(see Additional File 5) represented by a particular tree. The "0 node" tree was obtained for 26 partitions (3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 37, 40, 42). Abbreviations for functional partitions (yellow background) are
as follows: SI:Signalling, PI:Photosynthesis, R: Respiration, ST:Structural, TF:Transcription Factors, UK:Unknown Function;
'LessN' (on pink background) indicates trees where process partitions for one, two and three taxa are missing in the alignment.

notable in the branching order of relationships within the
gymnosperms.
In our analysis, cycads appear basal to a grouping of
Ginkgo, Gnetum and conifers, with Gnetales sister to the
Coniferales. This arrangement is in accordance with other
recent molecular studies, that conflict with the Anthophyte hypothesis. These other studies did not include a
morphological component. Our separate analysis of morphological characters supported the grouping of Gnetales
with angiosperms. However, the inclusion of the morphological data set in a combined analysis contributed nine
steps of hidden support to the grouping of Gnetales and
Coniferales.
Total branch support on the simultaneous analysis tree in
Figure 3 is 275 steps. Of those 275 steps, only 81 are
apparent in the separately analyzed partitions, while 194
are hidden. In other words, 70.5% of the phylogenetically
informative characters provide hidden support that would
not have been apparent had each gene region been analyzed separately. Figure 3 shows the distribution of this
hidden support (contributed by the 43 partitions) at each

node of the tree. Strikingly, 100% of the support for node
3 is hidden (69.3% hidden for node 1, 65.6% hidden for
node 2 and 78.1% hidden for node 4).
Figure 4 shows the various strategies we used for partitioned analyses in this study. In addition to exploring the
relative contribution of each individual partition to support on the tree, we also separated the sequence data into
three major partitions – chloroplast (16 genes), mitochondrial (6 genes) and nuclear (20 genes). As with the
yeast study [26], there is rampant disagreement amongst
the 43 individual partitions–both when compared to each
other, and to the combined (SA) tree (see Figure 4). But,
as shown in Figure 3, there is also a large amount of hidden support in the various partitions. Nodes 2 and 3 are
recovered in individual analysis of only two and four gene
partitions, respectively. This observation means that,
when analyzed separately, 40 and 38 gene partitions,
respectively, would disagree with nodes 2 and 3, which
are recovered in the simultaneous analysis tree through
hidden support. Figure 5 shows the total amount of hidden branch support for each of the process partitions
examined in this study.

hidden support. A key to all of the partition abbreviations are given in Additional file 5.

Effect of different partitioning strategies on hidden
support
We also examined broader groupings of the data in order
to explore the effect of different partitioning schema on
apparent and hidden support (Figure 3). The 20 nuclear
gene partitions, when combined into a single partition,
give the simultaneous analysis tree; the 16 chloroplast
partitions when combined, give a tree that while not fully
resolved, conflicts only at a single node with the simultaneous analysis tree; and the six mitochondrial genes
placed into a single partition gave a tree with two of the
four nodes in the simultaneous analysis tree that are in
agreement. Figure 3 also shows the hidden branch support for the three larger partitions (chloroplast, mitochondria and nuclear). An interesting result of this method of
partitioning is that it shows that the nuclear partition is
the only partition of the three major ones that positively
contributes branch support and hidden support to all four
nodes. This is despite the fact that much of the nuclear
data consist of ESTs, which are often short fragments with
large amounts of missing data. One possible explanation
for this result could be that the sheer number of characters

in the nuclear partition swamps out the characters in the
other two partitions. This does not seem to be the case, at
least with the present set of genes in the nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial character partitions, given that
the three partitions hold roughly equal numbers of raw
and phylogenetically informative characters. Chloroplast
and mitochondrial gene regions combined have 7268
characters, of which 478 are phylogenetically informative,
while the combined nuclear gene regions have 7890 characters, of which 517 are phylogenetically informative. In
addition, there is a large amount of missing data within
the nuclear partition, due to the inclusion of short EST
reads. Figure 6 [see also Additional file 3] shows the
amount of missing data for each taxon for each of the
broader scale groupings of the data (chloroplast, mitochondrial and nuclear).
In general, the broad nuclear gene data partition proved to
be the most consistent with the simultaneous analysis
tree. Not only is the nuclear gene tree topologically identical to the simultaneous analysis tree, but all simultaneous analysis tree nodes also receive positive branch

support, both hidden and apparent, from the nuclear data
set. While this might be seen as an argument for the preferential use of nuclear genes (or ESTs) in phylogenetic
analyses, over the molecular characters from other subcellular compartments (such as chloroplast and mitochondria), these subcellular compartments did contribute
character support to the simultaneous analysis tree
despite topological conflict. In addition, the topological
differences among subcellular gene partitions examined
using the ILD test (implemented in PAUP*[55]) were not
significant (p-value > 0.05, see below).
Exploration of incongruence among data partitions
In order to explore the interaction among data partitions
analyzed separately, we calculated ILDs [56] and tested
the significance of the resulting length differences [57]
between all possible pairwise comparisons of the individual data partitions as well as among the broader scale
groupings of the data that we examined for hidden sup-

port above. Of the 937 pairwise comparisons, 83 showed
significant length differences [see Additional file 4]. Of
those 83 conflicting pairwise comparisons, 13 were comparisons between the morphological data set and an individual gene partition; 18 were between mitochondrial
CO1 and another individual partition; 11 were between
the nuclear heat shock protein 82 and other individual
partitions; and 8 were between the chloroplast RNA
polymerase beta subunit 1 and other individual partitions. We highlight these examples to show that no single
partition dominated in terms of contributing conflict, but
only a handful of partitions are involved in significant
length differences. As with our examination of hidden
support, when we examined conflict among broader scale
groupings of the data, we found less conflict (as measured
by ILD). In addition, none of the broader scale groupings
examined for hidden support showed significant conflict
(as measured by ILD) except for those groupings compared to the morphological data set.

In our analyses, we established a matrix with six ingroup
taxa and one outgroup, and no taxa were removed from
the matrix at any time in our analysis regardless of
amounts of missing data in the various partitions. This
approach allowed us to explore the effect of the inclusion
of taxa with missing data by examining branch support
values contributed to the simultaneous analysis tree by
partitions with varying amounts of missing data. In this
case, we compared the contribution to support provided
by those partitions that contained at least some data (but
not necessarily the complete dataset) for all seven taxa to
the group of partitions that were lacking data for one
taxon for an entire partition (an individual gene region);
to those that were lacking data for two taxa and so forth.
In this way we were able to examine the affect of incompletely taxonomically sampled partitions.
Figure missing data on branch support
Effect of7
Effect of missing data on branch support. The randomness of EST sequencing results in some partitions not being
found for all taxa. This histogram shows the effect of missing
taxa in process partitions on support for each node. Support
decreases as less taxa are included in the analysis however,
these results do not take into account the varied amount and
distribution of data available for each taxon (see text). The
shading of the bars indicates the node in the SA tree: black =
node 1; darker gray = node 2; lighter gray = node 3 and
white = node 4. Branch support is given on the Y-axis, and
the number of taxa in a process partition are given in clusters
on the X-axis.

Effect of missing taxa
Several of the partitions we used had missing taxa due, for
example, to the lack of available sequence data for a given
taxon for a particular gene region [see Additional Files 1
and 3]. We explored the effect these missing taxa had on
the overall phylogenetic hypothesis by comparing the
amount of branch support and hidden branch support for
each node using partitions where information was available for 7, 6, 5 and 4 taxa. This type of analysis is particularly relevant to EST studies as the probability of obtaining
a full complement of taxa for a particular ortholog is
reduced as the number of taxa in the analysis increases.
Recent studies using large data sets, also containing ESTs
[58,59] examined the effect of missing data by removing
taxa with large amounts of missing data and comparing
those results to an analysis in which these taxa were not
excluded. Since the results of these analyses were similar,
it was concluded that the use of taxa with large amounts
of missing data did not bias the results. A simulation
study [60] concluded that it is not the amount of missing
data that is problematic in terms of resolving trees but the
presence of too few characters to allow taxon placement.

The result of our analysis is shown in Figure 7. While both
branch support [21,61,62] and hidden support [23] drop
to zero when there are fewer than 6 taxa in a partition, suggesting that individual partitions lacking more than two
taxa do not contribute support to the tree, there were differences in the overall amount and distribution of data for
each taxon; making a direct correlation to taxon number
difficult to establish with the present data set. The character set containing partitions that had at least some data for
all seven taxa (partitions: A1, A2, A3, A5, A7, A9, A10,
A11, A12, A14, A15, A24, A25, A26, A30, A31, A32, A34,
A35, A36 and A43) consisted of 8399 characters of which
544 were parsimony informative. The character set consisting of partitions that had at least some data for six taxa
(partitions: A6, A8, A13, A16, A18, A21, A22, A23, A27,
A28, A33, A39, A40, A41 and A42) consisted of 5310
characters of which 482 characters were parsimony
informative. The character set consisting of partitions that
had at least some data for five taxa (partitions: A4, A19,
A20 and A37) consisted of 767 characters of which 48
characters were parsimony informative. The character set
consisting of partitions that had at least some data for four
taxa (partitions: A17, A29 and A38) consisted of 849 characters of which 11 characters were parsimony informative.
Effect of different functional classes of genes
We also partitioned the data set into classes of genes based
on their cellular function. Our functional partitions were
MnoPSR (Non-Photosynthetic or Respiratory Metabolism: 7 gene partitions), photosynthetic (11 gene partitions), respiration (7 gene partitions), signalling (3 gene
partitions), structural (8 gene partitions), transcription
factors (2 gene partitions) and genes of unknown function (4 gene partitions).

Figure 8 shows the results of this partitioning exercise
where the raw support for a node is depicted as a function
of the different classes of genes. When the data are parti-

Node support from functional partitions. Support for each node in the simultaneous analysis tree from the various cellular function process partitions. The cellular function partitions are given in the legend to figure 4. The Y-axis indicates the
branch support value. Node information is in clusters of process partitions as indicated on the X-axis. For simplicity, branch
support values larger than ten are depicted here as 10.

tioned in this fashion, nodes 3 and 4 can be characterized
as having negative branch supports for some of the classes
of genes. Nodes 1 and 2 are supported by all functional
classes of genes. One of the more striking results in this
figure is the negative branch support obtained from transcription factors, respiration genes and photosynthetic
genes. Alternatively, positive support for all four nodes is
obtained from the metabolic genes, structural genes, signalling proteins and proteins of unknown function.
While our results would suggest that conserved structural
proteins and signalling proteins might be better at defining both deeper nodes and tree tip nodes, and proteins in
the transcription factor and respiration class of genes
might be best for nodes nearer the tips of the tree; the sample size of genes in functional partitions for this study is
small. Nevertheless, these results do suggest a potential
method for categorizing functional gene classes with
respect to their congruence with a simultaneous or organismal phylogeny. As more ESTs are added to the sequence
database, the sample sizes of these functional classes will
become larger and a more rigorous test of the role of functional class in phylogenetic analysis may be possible.

Discussion
Where to from here?
Rokas et al., [26] addressed the question of where in
sequence analysis space we need to be to robustly resolve
phylogenies; showing that > 20 genes or > 15 kb of
sequence produced a plateau of robustness at measures of
100% for conventionally used detectors of node robustness. The > 15, 000 base pairs and > 40 genes in the
present study is only enough to garner strong support for
three of the four nodes in the concatenated analysis tree
with node 3 receiving the weakest support in the analysis.
More sequence information is thus needed to resolve this
problem, and it appears from the hidden support analysis
that nuclear gene partitions will most efficiently provide
information for all nodes in the concatenated analysis
tree. In addition, both the yeast analysis by Rokas et al.
[26], and the seed plant analyses presented here strongly
suggest that even though a single gene partition might
support an alternative topology to the concatenated analysis tree, hidden support in most gene partitions will contribute positively to overall robustness of a phylogenetic
hypothesis. Finally, the yeast and seed plant examples,
while having similar numbers of ingroup taxa, suggest

Page 10 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:48

that different numbers of characters and genes will be
needed to assign robust inferences to nodes in studies. We
suggest that this discrepancy may be a factor of the different phylogenetic ages of the groups: the ingroup species in
the yeast phylogeny diverged between 50 and 100 MYA
[63,64] is basically within a genus, while the ingroup taxa
in the plant study diverged no earlier than 400 MYA [6567]. In addition, several studies with much larger numbers of ingroup taxa exist [23,42,44] and these studies suggest that larger numbers of characters than those of the
yeast study are required for robust resolution of this simple phylogenetic hypothesis. How many more characters?
A strong indication may be given by the high support and
robustness of node 1 (Arabidopsis + Oryza). A plateau of
topological robustness for other nodes may be reached
when a similar number of phylogenetically informative
characters is reached.
The approach we describe here, where support for the SA
tree is estimated for each process partition, will also pinpoint those partitions that disagree or conflict with the
overall general pattern of divergence of the taxa in the
analysis. If one assumes that the SA tree best represents
evolutionary history of the taxa involved, then such partitions are in conflict with overall organismal history of the
taxa in the analysis. This approach then would provide a
method for detecting process partitions that might be
selected for or have experienced drift and such partitions
might be important in some of the more interesting
organismal differences amongst the taxa in the analysis.
One final and important aspect of the present analysis
highlights a problem that will be prevalent in future
genomic level phylogenetic studies. This problem concerns the almost continual revision of the overall phylogenetic hypothesis for a set of taxa. For instance, as more and
more EST data are added to the database, more and more
process partitions can be added to an analysis. This will
effectively create a growing matrix that might even expand
daily. With the addition of each new process partition to
an analysis, all support values and other tree metrics such
as bootstrap values [50], jackknife values [68,69], Bayesian posterior probabilities [70-72], and node support
values [21-23,42,61,62,73] need to be recalculated. In
addition, the manual inclusion of the new process partitions to a growing matrix is time consuming and sometimes prone to error. We therefore suggest that such
important systematic questions where large amounts of
genomic level data are available have a need for an automated and rapid means for inclusion of new process partitions to the growing matrix. Such an automated
approach is under development for the seed plant question and will be discussed in a separate publication [74].

Conclusion
• Simultaneous analysis using 42 gene partitions and a
morphological partition yield a phylogenetic hypothesis
with a monophyletic gymnosperms which is at odds with
the Anthophyte hypothesis.
• Addition of short EST sequences to a data set can
enhance a phylogenetic analysis, if the problems of
sequence quality and orthology are overcome.
• The majority of support in this study is hidden support,
meaning that the support is not immediately apparent in
single gene partitions.
• Completeness of data partitions with respect to full
complement of taxa had a large affect on levels of support
in phylogenetic analysis. In our study example with seven
taxa, support from partitions that had sequences for five
or fewer taxa was nonexistent. However, variation in the
amount and distribution of data within partitions may
also play a role.
• When phylogenetic incongruence between a partitioned
functional class of genes (such as transcription factors)
and the organismal phylogeny is detected, this result suggests that the partition has experienced a unique evolutionary history relative to the organisms. This different
evolutionary history can be used as a signpost of altered
evolutionary pressure in a particular class of genes. In this
way, incongruence of a particular class of genes (such as
transcription factors) in a partitioned analysis allow us to
establish hypotheses about the evolution and potential
function of these gene classes.

Methods
Orthology determination and phylogentic analyses
Many studies use pairwise sequence comparison schemes,
such as BLAST [75], COG (Clusters of Orthologous
Groups; [76]), INPARANOID [77,78], RBH (Reciprocal
Blast Hits; [79,80]), and RSD (Reciprocal Smallest Distance Algorithm; [81]) to determine gene orthology on a
genomic scale.

Since we are ultimately interested in exploring the characters associated with particular evolutionary novelties, we
use a character-based alternative to distance based methods for the identification of orthologous gene regions. The
tree-building approach to orthology determination
involves the generation of gene family trees in order to
identify the orthologous gene family member for each EST
sequence. Within a character-based parsimony framework, nodes are defined by shared derived characters.
Without automation, this approach would be prohibitively time consuming and labor intensive and would

Page 11 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:48

greatly restrict the use of genomic-scale EST data in parsimony based analyses since the placement of ESTs into
orthology groups using this character-based approach
would require manual rebuilding of gene family trees for
each new EST to be classified. Therefore, during the course
of this study, we developed automated methods for
orthology determination within a parsimony framework:
OrthologID [41], [92] firefox/Netscape is the preferred
browser–Internet Explorer is not supported by the current
OrthologID viewer). This approach builds gene family
trees using sequences from available completely
sequenced genomes (currently, Arabidopsis,Oryza and Populus; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is used as an outgroup in
the gene tree analyses for orthology determination), such
that all members of a given gene family are included. In
addition, rather than including EST sequences in the gene
tree construction analysis, the whole genome gene family
trees are first used to construct "guide" trees. These gene
family guide trees are used to identify diagnostic characters for each gene family member and then EST query
sequences are screened for the presence of shared diagnostics using the CAOS algorithm (See [82] for details of the
guide tree/CAOS approach). This approach eliminates the
need to manually rebuild a gene family tree each time a
new EST sequence requires orthology determination.
We use only completely sequenced genomes for constructing gene family guide trees with OrthologID in order
to minimize the possibility of the erroneous placement of
query sequences due to missing data. If gene family guide
trees had been constructed using partially sequenced
genomes, it is possible that some gene family members
would be missing, in which case it could be possible that
queries orthologous to these missing gene family members would be incorrectly placed. The current database of
plant genomes will soon be expanded to include complete genomes from other phylogenetic lineages, including prokaryotes and non-plant eukaryotes.
OrthologID automatically searches the local database of
completely sequenced plant genomes and performs an
initial clustering of gene sequences into putative gene
families, using NCBI BLAST [83] with an expectation
value cutoff of 1e-20. Next it builds gene family trees. It
performs sequence alignments using the program MAFFT
[84] using different sets of alignment parameters to create
three different alignments for each gene family and culls
[85] alignment ambiguous regions. The three pairs of gap
open penalty and offset values are (1.53, 0.123), (2.4,
0.1), and (1.0, 0.2). It performs tree searches within a parsimony framework, using either exhaustive searches or,
where exhaustive tree searches are not possible due to a
large number of putative gene family members, heuristic
searches are performed implementing the parsimony
ratchet [86] with 200 re-weighting iterations for each of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/48

20 ratchets; in order to rigorously explore tree space. It
saves resultant trees and computes the strict consensus
when multiple equally parsimonious trees are obtained
from the analysis and then passes these guide trees to the
CAOS algorithm to identify node diagnostics. In order to
identify the ortholog of an EST sequence, OrthologID uses
the CAOS algorithm to screen the ESTs for the presence of
characters that are diagnostic of nodes on the guide tree.
Once EST orthologs had been identified, we manually
assembled a process partition matrix for each orthologous
gene region for all of the seven chosen plant taxa;
sequences for the moss Physcomitrella patens [87,88] were
used as outgroup in all phylogenetic analyses. We aligned
the sequences for each process partition using the default
parameters in Clustal [89]. We assembled a simultaneous
analysis matrix composed of 42 gene regions consisting of
mitochondrial (6), chloroplast (16) and nuclear (20;
including 19 composed of EST protein sequences and one
of DNA sequences [18S rDNA]) along with a single morphological partition. A list of all the gene regions, and the
accession numbers of all sequences used in the analysis,
can be found in Additional file 1. In several instances in
which a mitochondrial or chloroplast sequence was not
available for a given taxon, we substituted the corresponding sequence from a related species. These are noted inAdditional file 1. The matrix used in the analyses can be
found as Additional file 2. Phylogenetic analyses were
accomplished in PAUP* version 4.0b1.0 [55] using
exhaustive searches. Measures of branch support
[21,23,61,62] were accomplished using batch command
files in PAUP*, and the resulting log files were imported
into an Excel spreadsheet for final calculations.
