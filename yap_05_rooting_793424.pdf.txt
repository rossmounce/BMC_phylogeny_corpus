Abstract
Background: We compared two methods of rooting a phylogenetic tree: the stationary and the
nonstationary substitution processes. These methods do not require an outgroup.
Methods: Given a multiple alignment and an unrooted tree, the maximum likelihood estimates of
branch lengths and substitution parameters for each associated rooted tree are found; rooted trees
are compared using their likelihood values. Site variation in substitution rates is handled by assigning
sites into several classes before the analysis.
Results: In three test datasets where the trees are small and the roots are assumed known, the
nonstationary process gets the correct estimate significantly more often, and fits data much better,
than the stationary process. Both processes give biologically plausible root placements in a set of
nine primate mitochondrial DNA sequences.
Conclusions: The nonstationary process is simple to use and is much better than the stationary
process at inferring the root. It could be useful for situations where an outgroup is unavailable.

Background
Several approaches for inferring a phylogenetic tree from
the substitution patterns in multiply aligned sequences
are available; they include maximum parsimony, distance-based, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods
[1]. Typically, the inferred tree is unrooted, because the
explicit or implicit substitution process used is usually
time-reversible. An effective way to put the root on the
unrooted tree is to perform a phylogenetic analysis on the
sequences of interest together with an outgroup, which is
a set of distantly related sequences [2,3]. If the ingroup is
monophyletic in the combined phylogenetic tree, then
the point where the outgroup touches the ingroup tree is
the estimated root. The practical challenge is to find suitable outgroups, and if no such outgroup is available, then

one is forced to root the tree using just the ingroup. Several such methods include the molecular clock and nonreversible substitution processes. It seems clear that
compared to the outgroup method, the success of these
methods is more dependent on the extent to which the
accompanying assumptions about the substitution process are satisfied in the data. For example, the molecular
clock method should work well if the lineages indeed
evolved more or less at the same rate. Likewise, as shown
by Huelsenbeck et al. [4], a nonreversible process is more
likely to succeed the less reversible the real substitution
process is.
The nonreversible substitution process, introduced by
Yang [5], is stationary, i.e., the sequence composition is

unchanged in time, and is equal to the equilibrium distribution of the rate matrix Q. The consensus is that it does
not have enough power to discriminate among the candidate rooted trees. In this paper, we investigate a slightly
more general, nonstationary process: in which the initial
distribution π may not be the equilibrium distribution of
the rate matrix Q. A priori, giving up stationarity is
expected to produce a much better fit to data, since
sequence composition is known to evolve, and should be
accounted for. Indeed, substitution models where each
branch has its own rate matrices had been used to resolve
deep splittings in certain phylogenetic trees; see Yang and
Roberts, and Galtier and Gouy [6,7]. Our process, which
to our knowledge has not been investigated in this context, may be viewed as the simplest case of such nonstationary processes, with many fewer parameters. Thus, it
can be used to decide whether the substitution processes
on certain branches should be modeled differently. The
input to our procedure is a multiple alignment and the
topology of an unrooted binary tree. For each rooted tree
associated with the given unrooted tree, we seek the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the branch lengths, π
and Q. The rooted trees are then ranked in descending
order of likelihoods. We model systematic variation in
substitution rates among sites by assigning sites into several classes, and the relative rate for each class is estimated
by ML; this is equivalent to the combined analysis framework of Yang [8].
We compared the ability of the stationary and nonstationary processes to place the root in three groups of species
where the answer is considered well-known: (1) human,
chimpanzee and gorilla, (2) human, chimpanzee, gorilla
and orangutan, (3) human, mouse, chicken and frog
(xenopus laevis). The analyses were based on all available
mitochondrial protein-coding genes, as well as two
nuclear protein-coding genes. Next, we applied the methods to a set of primate mitochondrial DNA sequences.

Results
Verification studies
We fitted the nonstationary (NONSTA), stationary (STA)
and reversible (REV) substitution models to all available
mitochondrial protein-coding genes, as well as the
nuclear genes albumin and c-myc, for three groups of
organisms: (1) human, chimpanzee and gorilla, (2)
human, chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan, and (3)
human, mouse, chicken and frog (xenopus laevis). The
sequences were downloaded from Genbank and aligned
using the CLUSTALW alignment of the amino acid
sequences. Most alignments looked quite solid [see Additional files]. The beginning of the alignments for the genes
COX1, CYTB, ND1 and ND6 were slightly adjusted. The
root positions are assumed to be on the (1) gorilla, (2)
orangutan, and (3) frog branch, respectively. The

branches on a tree are referred to by the organism names,
except for the case of four taxa, where there is an internal
branch (Figure 1). For groups (2) and (3), it was assumed
that human was most closely related to chimpanzee and
mouse respectively; thus the unrooted tree is determined.
In group 1, the NONSTA and STA processes correctly
placed the root in 8 and 6 genes respectively, out of 13
genes (Table 1). In group 2, NONSTA correctly placed the
root in 9 genes out of 13 genes, compared to 2 genes for
STA (Table 2). In group 3, NONSTA correctly placed the

The assumed unrooted tree is that presented in Yang [5].
The branches adjacent to leaf nodes are referred to by the
corresponding organisms, while the interior branches are
labelled a through f as indicated.

integer) of the MLEs for 15 rooted trees under the nonstationary

ing rooted tree often has noticeably higher log likelihoods
than competing rooted trees; this is not so with STA. Thus,
NONSTA is much better than STA in placing the root at
the individual gene level. Combining the log likelihoods
across genes yields overall evidence for the root placements. Table 4 shows that NONSTA is unambiguously
correct in all three analyses, while STA only gets the root
correctly in group 3, and the signal is weak.
The nuclear genes albumin and c-myc and three mitochondrial genes, COX1, COX2 and ATP6 from group 3 (with
some mouse genes replaced with rat genes) were studied
by Huelsenbeck et al. [4]. For these five genes, NONSTA
and STA performed equally, getting all the correct root
placements, except for ATP6, with NONSTA again noticeably more discriminative.
Primate mitochondrial DNA
Brown et al. and Yang [5,9] studied a set of mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) sequences from human, chimpanzee,
gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, crab-eating monkey, squirrel
monkey, tarsier and lemur. The topology of Yang's
unrooted tree and the branch labels are shown in Figure
2. The mtDNA sequences consist of two protein-coding
fragments, separated by three RNA genes. Thus, four site
classes are required. Analysis with NONSTA shows that
the root is most likely on the tarsier branch, followed
closely by the lemur and "f" branches, and the corresponding log likelihoods are quite different from the others (see Table 5). Under STA, the most likely root
placements are on the squirrel monkey and lemur

branches. Thus, both processes give predictions that are
consistent (NONSTA more than STA) with the idea that
the root should be somewhere near tarsier and lemur.
However, as observed before, NONSTA has much greater
discriminative power, and fits the data much better, than
STA.

Discussion
Our results confirmed earlier findings that the stationary
process (STA) is not very good at discriminating among
rooted trees corresponding to the same unrooted tree. In
contrast, the nonstationary (NONSTA) process seems

much more effective, with individual genes, and with
combined genes. It is quite clear that the difference in log
likelihoods between fitting STA and the reversible process
(REV) is often small, and statistically insignificant, based
on the likelihood ratio test, while those between NONSTA
and STA, and between NONSTA and REV, are often large,
and statistically very significant. Though the chi-square
distribution may be inappropriate [10], it seems to be satisfatory in practice [11]. This indicates that NONSTA fits
the data much better than STA and REV. Thus it appears
that allowing an initial distribution that is uncoupled
with the rate matrix gives a better description of the data,
and that the greater capacity of NONSTA over STA at estimating the root placement may stem from the ability of
NONSTA to allow for some amount of evolution in base
composition.
Although Huelsenbeck et al.'s analysis using STA failed to
place the root correctly in any of the genes albumin, c-myc,
COX1, COX2 and ATP6, there are some differences
between the analyses. The raw data were different: the rat
albumin and c-myc genes were used by Huelsenbeck et al.;
since mouse and rat are very similar, this is not likely to
matter much. Secondly, the alignments were probably different, though since the sequences are quite similar, this
should not be too important. It is plausible that most of
the discrepancies between the results is due to the difference in the estimation procedure (maximum likelihood
vs. Bayesian) and to the fact that in Huelsenbeck et al., site
variation was modeled by the gamma distribution [12],
whereas here we only accounted for the codon position
effect.
Estimates of the relative rates are quite independent of the
model used, and their relative magnitudes are largely
within expectations. In particular, for group 3, the relative
rates for codon positions 1, 2, and 3 fall between .2 and
1.1, .1 and .6, and 1.5 and 2.7 respectively. For all genes,
the third codon position evolved the fastest, followed by
the first and second positions. To gauge the contribution
from the third codon position, we left out the corresponding bases in group 3 and reran the analysis with NONSTA.
This gave the correct root placement in only three genes:
albumin, c-myc and ND2, showing the usefulness of the
third codon position in this dataset, despite its markedly
higher substitution rates. We also found that the pairwise
identity at the third codon positions for all genes in
groups 3 ranges from 34% to 61%. Base composition
being generally nonuniform, the expected pairwise identity at saturation (i.e., infinite evolutionary distance) is
lower than 25%. This seems to indicate that the third
codon position is not saturated, and hence the phylogenetic information from this position is not just the base
composition at each taxon. In addition, the base composition at the third codon position for some genes is quite

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/2

different from the other positions. Our model does not fit
these genes as well as a model where separate processes
are associated with the codon positions. Such a model will
be investigated in future.
The NONSTA process is only slightly more complicated to
apply, compared to the STA and REV processes. The fact
that it works quite well in the verification studies and predicts biologically plausible roots for the nine-primate data
demonstrates its utility and perhaps argues for its use in
routine phylogenetic analysis. In any case, if no suitable
outgroup is available, it could be worthwhile to try it.
Though the NONSTA process is the most general timehomogeneous Markov process, it is still simplistic and
imposes a severe constraint on the evolution of base composition: if two leaf nodes are at the same distance from
the root, then the process stipulates that the corresponding sequences must have the same composition. This is
patently unrealistic: once lineages split, they should
evolve quite independently, and may explain the failure
of the process at estimating the root placement for some
genes. However, it is still valuable even if it does not
always work, in that it can serve as a base from which
exploration of richer models can be launched. For
instance, one could identify lineages where the evolution
significantly deviates from expectations, and then allow
these lineages to have different rate matrices, which brings
us closer to the very rich models of [6,7,13,14].

Conclusions
The nonstationary substitution process is simple to use,
has much greater power at estimating the root compared
to the stationary process, and also fits data much better
than the stationary and reversible processes. It seems feasible to use this process in analyses where a suitable outgroup is not easily available. It is also a good starting point
for conducting more sophisticated phylogenetic analysis
with richer models.

Methods
Substitutions in DNA sequences are assumed to occur
independently at each site according to a Markov process,
i.e., given the present base, future substitutions are independent of past substitutions.
Furthermore, it is assumed that the process is time-homogeneous, i.e., substitution rates stay constant in time. As
usual, the substitution rate from base a to b is the (a, b)entry in a 4 × 4 rate matrix Q; the diagonal entries are such
that each row sums to 0. For any t > 0, the transition probability P(t) is given by P(t) = exp(Qt). Let π be a probability distribution on the DNA bases. The pair (π, Q) defines
a substitution process on a rooted tree, as follows: pick a
base at the root according to π, then run the substitution
process according to Q down the tree, splitting into inde-

pendent copies whenever a branching is encountered. The
joint probability of the observed bases at the leaf nodes
can be computed using almost exactly the same algorithm
by [15].

into several classes is known in advance, such as a coding
sequence, the easiest way to deal with it is to associate to
class i an unknown positive number ri, with the constraint
that

There are two important special cases of the time-homogeneous process (π, Q). Associated with the rate matrix Q
is a unique distribution πQ, called the equilibrium distribution of Q, such that the matrix product πQ × Q is the
zero vector. The process (πQ, Q) is stationary, i.e., the
sequence composition remains unchanged through time,
and is described by πQ. Q is said to be reversible if it satisfies the detailed balance condition:

∑ ri ni = ∑ ni

ΠQQ = Q'ΠQ
where ΠQ is the diagonal form of πQ and Q' is the transpose of Q. The process (πQ, Q) is then reversible, i.e., statistically the process looks the same in forward and
backward time. In particular, as shown in [15], the joint
distribution of the leaf bases is the same regardless of
where the root is placed on the tree. The reversible process
is known as the REV or time-reversible process in the
molecular evolution literature [5,16,17]. Special cases of
the REV process include those by Jukes and Cantor,
Kimura, Felsenstein (two processes), Hasegawa, Kishino
and Yano, and Tamura and Nei [15,18-22]. The nonreversible stationary process was first explored by Yang [5],
and subsequently by Huelsenbeck et al. [4]. Yang referred
to this process as "unrestricted", but we use the abbreviation STA here. We shall refer to the nonstationary process
as NONSTA. The numbers of free parameters in the NONSTA, STA and REV processes are respectively 15 (3 in π and
12 off-diagonal entries in Q), 12 (off-diagonal entries in
Q) and 9 (3 in πQ and 12 off-diagonal entries in Q, minus
6 detailed balance constraints). Since the models are
nested, the likelihood ratio test can be used to assess the
relative goodness-of-fit of the MLEs. It is standard practice
to allow only calibrated rate matrices, i.e., Q satisfies

−∑ π Q (a)Q(a, a) = 1
a

so that a branch length is the average number of substitution events per site. We adopt this practice, and remark
that for the nonstationary process (π, Q), with calibrated
Q, since in general π ≠ πQ, it is not true that the expected
number of substitutions in 1 time unit is 1, but the difference gets arbitrarily small as time goes to infinity.
The sites in a DNA sequences can have very different substitution rates, the most well-known example being coding sequences, where the third codon positions evolved
much faster than the others because of the degeneracy of
the genetic code. In cases where the assignment of sites

where ni is the number of sites in class i. The relative rate
ri either expands or shrinks the tree depending on whether
it is more or less than 1. The constraint gives a new interpretation of a branch length: it is now the average over all
sites of their expected number of substitutions. Thus, this
approach is similar to [8]: effectively, the classes are
treated as separate datasets. In this study, coding
sequences are divided into three classes by codon position. In the last dataset consisting of nine primate mitochondrial sequences, an additional class is created to
account for the RNA-coding bases. Another source of site
variation is related to the three-dimensional structure of
the protein. For example, hydrophilic residues are usually
exposed, hence tend to evolve faster than hydrophobic
residues which are deeply buried. Our present approach
does not model this and other less obvious sources of site
variation. Possible remedies include using the gamma distribution [12] or the hidden Markov model [23].
Given a rooted tree relating aligned coding sequences, we
seek the ML estimates of the branch lengths, the substitution parameters, and the relative rates. For other
sequences, the relative rates are not estimated. Gradientbased methods are perhaps the most efficient at finding
the maximum. The EM algorithm [24] is another possibility. We implemented the simplex method [25], which is
slower but is less likely to be misled to local maxima than
gradient-based methods. To further reduce the chance of
being fooled by local maxima, different initial estimates
were used, and the final estimates with the highest likelihood was picked. The initial estimates were obtained by
first deriving a reversible rate matrix from a pairwise comparison of two sequences, then using the associated REV
process to find the most likely branch lengths and relative
rates; all pairwise comparisons were used in this study, so
that, for example, four taxa give six initial estimates.
The estimation procedure was implemented in C, and the
source code can be requested from the first author.
