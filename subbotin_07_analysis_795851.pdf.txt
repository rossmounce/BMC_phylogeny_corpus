Abstract
Background: Despite a prodigious investment of funds, we cannot treat or prevent
arteriosclerosis and restenosis, particularly its major pathology, arterial intimal hyperplasia. A
cornerstone question lies behind all approaches to the disease: what causes the pathology?
Hypothesis: I argue that the question itself is misplaced because it implies that intimal hyperplasia
is a novel pathological phenomenon caused by new mechanisms. A simple inquiry into arterial
morphology shows the opposite is true. The normal multi-layer cellular organization of the tunica
intima is identical to that of diseased hyperplasia; it is the standard arterial system design in all
placentals at least as large as rabbits, including humans. Formed initially as one-layer endothelium
lining, this phenotype can either be maintained or differentiate into a normal multi-layer cellular
lining, so striking in its resemblance to diseased hyperplasia that we have to name it "benign intimal
hyperplasia". However, normal or "benign" intimal hyperplasia, although microscopically identical
to pathology, is a controllable phenotype that rarely compromises blood supply. It is remarkable
that each human heart has coronary arteries in which a single-layer endothelium differentiates early
in life to form a multi-layer intimal hyperplasia and then continues to self-renew in a controlled
manner throughout life, relatively rarely compromising the blood supply to the heart, causing
complications requiring intervention only in a small fraction of the population, while all humans are
carriers of benign hyperplasia. Unfortunately, this fundamental fact has not been widely appreciated
in arteriosclerosis research and medical education, which continue to operate on the assumption
that the normal arterial intima is always an "ideal" single-layer endothelium. As a result, the disease
is perceived and studied as a new pathological event caused by new mechanisms. The discovery
that normal coronary arteries are morphologically indistinguishable from deadly coronary
arteriosclerosis continues to elicit surprise.
Conclusion: Two questions should inform the priorities of our research: (1) what controls switch
the single cell-layer intimal phenotype into normal hyperplasia? (2) how is normal (benign)
hyperplasia maintained? We would be hard-pressed to gain practical insights without scrutinizing
our premises.

Background
Most publications on coronary artery disease discuss
progress achieved. However, there is an alternative perception of the problem, rarely enunciated in established med-

ical journals: the stunning failure of contemporary
medicine to treat cardiovascular disorders [1]. This sounds
extreme, but all medical professionals ought to agree on a
simple fact: we cannot treat coronary disease. We can perPage 1 of 20

form bypass operations, angioplasty, stents, and heart
transplants, but these are all palliative emergency measures that only delay morbidity and mortality; they save
lives but do not address the problem fundamentally.
Undoubtedly, angioplasty and stenting are major innovations in cardiovascular treatment, but restenosis follows.
Now, after years of reports on the successful outcome of
stenting, we even question whether we should return to
medical therapy alone for certain coronary diseases [2].
Is this goal achievable? Could we possibly treat coronary
disease as effectively as we learned to treat certain acute
diseases – as we treat an acute pneumonia with antibiotics
or acute organ rejection with anti-rejection drugs? Why
cannot we treat coronary artery disease the same fashion?
Prevention via healthy life style works [1,3-5], but it is not
what we are investing in. We want to help patients when
they become sick. We want to make diseased organs
healthy again. So, is coronary disease treatable in general
or we are chasing an unattainable dream?
Subject of analysis
Definition of intimal hyperplasia
The subject of my analysis is arterial intimal hyperplasia.
This term applies to any cells that form a multi-layer compartment internally to the elastic membrane of the arterial
wall and express alpha-smooth-muscle actin, permanently or transitionally [6,7]. The pathology of coronary
disease comprises a number of distinct features such as
intimal hyperplasia, appearance of foam cells/macrophages and cholesterol buildup, platelet aggregation and
thrombogenesis, inflammation etc. These features often
overlap and aggravate each other [8], but this analysis
focuses exclusively on arterial intimal hyperplasia since it
represents a separate pathological entity [9-11]. It is a cell
proliferation/differentiation process, representing cellular
morphogenesis in its traditional sense [12-14], while cholesterol accumulation and plaque formation is a degenerative process, usually described under the heading
"Endogenous substances accumulating in tissues as a
result of deranged metabolism" [15]. Although it is worth
noting that excessive intimal hyperplasia usually precedes
atherosclerosis (appearance of foam cells/macrophages,
cholesterol accumulation and plaque formation)
[7,10,11,16], analyzing these characteristics together inevitably diminishes significance of correlations [17].
Medical significance of coronary artery hyperplasia and history of
approach
Arterial intimal hyperplasia (other definitions include
arteriosclerosis, neointimal formation, vasculopathy, etc.)
contributes significantly to initial (pre-interventional)
coronary artery disease [18-20]. We used drug therapy for
decades; but since it was not satisfactory, a new state-of-art
tool was created – coronary intervention. Nevertheless,

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

intimal hyperplasia appears to be the sole or major devastating pathological remodeling in post-interventional
complications after angioplasty, bypass operations or
stenting [21-23], and once begun, it is untreatable. We
introduced bypass surgery, but intimal hyperplasia keeps
growing in the grafted veins and arteries. We introduced
angioplasty with balloon dilatation, but intimal hyperplasia grows after vessel stretching. We introduced angioplasty with stenting, but intimal hyperplasia keeps
growing through the stents. We introduced stents with the
best rational design – radioactive emission – but intimal
hyperplasia, together with late thrombosis [24-26], again
significantly hampered this innovation [27]. We introduced drug-eluting stents, which retard growth, but intimal hyperplasia continues [28-31]. Intimal hyperplasia
threatens literally every known vascular reconstructive
procedure and no prophylaxis is available [32,33].
Reports evolved from very optimistic [34] and cautiously
optimistic [35] to questioning the long-term effectiveness
of coronary intervention [2,36-38].
Common sense tells that tangible factors must cause and
perpetuate this devastating hyperplasia pathology. The
basis of such an approach is quite obvious. Scientific medicine was founded on fundamental milestones: the discovery of microorganisms and understanding their
connection to disease, then the discovery of vaccination/
antibiotics followed by successful prevention and treatment of diseases [39]. The historically beneficial model
"bacteria → disease → vaccination/antibiotic → cure" was
then transformed into "aberrant protein expression → disease → corrected protein expression → cure" model.
Owing to the nature of biology, the reduction of problems
to simple cause and effect mechanisms is a basic and very
effective approach to medical science. Armed with this
obvious idea we never stop searching for causes, but the
results we have achieved are very far from desirable. Hundreds of thousands of articles and hundreds of monographs have been published, countless scientific meetings
held. Every molecule associated with coronary stenosis,
soluble or residual, has been thoroughly investigated and
characterized and attempts have been made to modulate
it, often successfully. The result is the same: we cannot
treat the disease. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to suggest
that examining factors associated with chronic diseases in
"cause – effect" fashion may finally produce a much
needed answer, so it should remain the main methodology. Therefore, on the basis of conventional wisdom, we
try the same approach again and again.
Methodology of research on chronic disorders
There is a valid argument, however, that in chronic disorders we encounter problems that cannot be reduced to
simple cause and effect mechanisms [40,41]. Experience
shows that the "one protein – one disease" relationship is

Page 2 of 20

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2007, 4:41

the exception rather than the medical rule. Usually,
chronic disorders result from alterations of normal controls, but the associated altered parameters, although
detectable, do not necessarily point to causation or suggest possible approaches to prevention [41-44]. Altered
parameters in chronic diseases also depend on numerous
factors or variables that are difficult to control and analyze
[45]. Nevertheless, the paradigm "one (few) protein – one
disease" dominates the scientific study of chronic disorders with organ remodeling. The hope for a "lucky" molecule and "magic bullet", combined with modern state-ofthe-art instrumentation, opened the floodgates for competitive data collection. Unfortunately, collection of
measurable parameters is widely assumed to constitute
knowledge in both medicine and biology, and this is not
true [46]. Therefore, we effectively consume our scientific
resources by highly competitive data collection, adding to
an already overextended collection of disparate factors
associated with the disease. New research tools, e.g. studying arteriosclerosis and restenosis in terms of the typical
characteristics of transplant immunology, definitely yields
new information [47-50], but the theoretical basis for
approaches of this kind is not convincing. It actually
becomes increasingly difficult to find articles containing
particular information, because any given literature search
yields thousands of irrelevant references burying a few
useful ones. In addition, mixing all associated parameters
in any analysis has been shown to diminish the prognostic correlative value of obviously related observations
[17].
Is coronary arteriosclerosis a treatable condition?
Hypothetically, both "YES" and "NO" are valid answers to
the question "are coronary arteriosclerosis and re-stenosis
treatable conditions?" The "NO" answer seems more
plausible since it receives continual experimental conformation, but we would not wish to choose it for at least
three reasons. First, against all odds, we believe that all
diseases are cognizable entities and therefore treatable; we
also know that some diseases that were completely
untreatable in the past came to be understood and cured
later. Second, the academic community depends on public funding and the pharmaceutical world is based on
profit. The "NO" answer would be collective corporate
suicide and is therefore very improbable. Third, all members of our society have a natural desire to remain healthy
until death at an advanced age. Therefore, there is a unanimous desire and demand only for the "YES" answer, and
we must endorse this no matter how implausible our
experience makes it sound. But if "YES" is the only answer,
we ought to do something better than before. Otherwise,
for how much longer will society be willing to tolerate the
ineffectiveness of investment? Not very, according to
some scientists.

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

Some scholars anticipate that research funding for chronic
disorders will simply be reduced because of the lack of
return and alternative claims for funding [51,52]. This
prediction is plausible and extremely worrisome, so why
should we not try alternative approaches to the problem?
Shortcomings of the traditional approach to coronary intimal
hyperplasia
All major hypotheses, and hence approaches to the
pathology of intimal hyperplasia, are traditionally
founded on the cornerstone question: what causes the
pathology? I argue that this question is misplaced because
it implies that (a) intimal hyperplasia is a novel pathological phenomenon caused by new mechanisms and (b) the
putative cause is not within intimal hyperplasia but external to it. A simple inquiry into arterial morphology shows
the opposite is true. The normal multi-layer cellular
organization of the tunica intima is identical to that of diseased hyperplasia, a standard arterial system design in all
placental mammals at least as large as rabbits, including
humans [53-68]. Formed initially as a one-layer endothelial lining, this phenotype can either be maintained or differentiate into a normal multi-layer cellular lining, so
striking in its resemblance to diseased hyperplasia that we
have to name it "benign intimal hyperplasia" [69-71].
However, normal or "benign" intimal hyperplasia,
although microscopically identical to pathology, is a controllable phenotype that very seldom compromises the
blood supply. It is remarkable that each human heart has
coronary arteries in which a single-layer endothelium differentiates early in life to form the multi-layer intimal
hyperplasia and then continues to renew itself in a controlled fashion throughout life [61,67,70,72-77].
Although normal intimal hyperplasia becomes bigger
with aging [78], very rarely does it grow into a disease
compromising the blood supply to the heart. Normal intimal hyperplasia becomes uncontrolled causing impaired
coronary blood flow requiring intervention, in only a
small fraction of human population [79,80]. Two obvious
questions should inform the priorities of our research: (1)
what controls are responsible for switching the single celllayer intimal phenotype to the normal multi-layer intimal
hyperplasia? (2) what controls maintain the normal
benign intimal hyperplasia?

Differentiation of the tunica intima and normal benign
intimal hyperplasia are controlled and maintained in vast
majority of human hearts. We do not know how this regulation works, but nor do we invest much in its study. On
the other hand, in only a small fraction of humans (that
could be approximated on the order of 1% [79-81]), this
obscure regulation malfunctions jeopardizing life for
unknown reasons and we are investing almost all our
resources in studying possible causes of such malfunction.
Would it not be more logical to approach the problem the

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2007, 4:41

other way around? Besides, we already know that even the
most rigidly programmed morphogenic processes can
deviate under the influence of a whole range of non-specific foreign signals, and it is useless to study non-specific
signals to elucidate morphogenesis [82]. Furthermore,
judging from the clinical failure of all therapeutic
approaches based on elimination of one factor or a handful of factors, it appears that non-specific stimuli are multiple, interchangeable and act in yet unknown
combinations. These features make non-specific signals
unrealistic therapeutic targets.
Origin and consequences of misleading approaches to arterial intimal
hyperplasia
All science is about causation. We observe an event and if
it is not consistent with our explanatory models, we ask
why. In order to ask a question we must see a discrepancy
between what is observed and what the model predicts;
the observation should be surprising. Is it surprising that
the arterial intima expresses and maintains two distinct
phenotypes within the same arterial conduit throughout
human life, or that one of these phenotypes, normal intimal hyperplasia resembles the disease so strikingly that it
has been named "benign intimal hyperplasia" [69-71]? Is
it surprising that "benign intimal hyperplasia" is so well
controlled that it never turns into disease in the vast
majority of humans? In general, not at all!

Medical scientists in mainstream research either do not
appreciate these fundamental facts or are simply not
aware about them. In consequence, all approaches operate on the assumption that the normal arterial intima is
always an "ideal" [83] single-layer endothelium. Even
worse, we teach medical students this distorted view. Any
standard textbook of histology, e.g. [84-86], along with
most monographs on coronary disease, e.g. [87-90],
presents arterial morphology this way. The famous "Color
Atlas of Cytology, Histology, and Microscopic Anatomy"
for medical students by Wolfgang Kuehnel [91], which
was translated into all Western languages, does not even
include coronary artery morphology, leaving readers with
the illusion that it is the same as in any artery of this caliber. At best, some textbooks comment briefly that the
intima of elastic arteries may be thicker [92,93], or that
the intima of coronary arteries shows the greatest agerelated changes [94], still stressing the single-cell layer
intimal design. Rare exceptions such as the "Histology for
Pathologist"[95], chapter 33 "Blood Vessels" [96] or [97]
cannot reverse this general perception because few people
read them and do so too late, after this ideology has
already been formed.
Common sense leads one to question whether the current
disastrous outcome in arteriosclerosis treatment may not
arise because the common stock of hypotheses underlying

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

these studies is misleading. These dominant hypotheses
are based on two major premises: (1) arterial intimal
hyperplasia is a pathology formed de novo, due to de novo
pathological changes in regulation replacing the singlelayer intima; and (2) the putative de novo causative mechanisms occur outside the site of pathology. This perception is unlikely to change, since we teach students
deficient knowledge about arterial morphology and differentiation, making it very likely that the problem will
continue to be approached from wrong premises.
Some publications allude to intimal hyperplasia under normal
conditions but this has little influence on contemporary research
These contentions may be dismissed on the basis of the
many articles that discuss normal intimal hyperplasia in
regard to arterial pathology, as my opponents argued
before, so it is necessary to clarify the point. Some papers
do indeed contain allusions to intimal hyperplasia under
normal conditions. Some of them make the customary
comment that arteries with normal intimal hyperplasia
are prone to arteriosclerosis [10,11][67,98,99]. Unfortunately, this research stops short of making any scientific
tool from observations. Consider the two most frequently
cited. (1) Stary et al., 1992 "A definition of the intima of
human arteries and of its atherosclerosis- prone regions. A
report from the Committee on Vascular Lesions of the
Council on Arteriosclerosis, American Heart Association",
published in Circulation [10] and in Arteriosclerosis and
Thrombosis [6], has been cited 365 times. This is a gigantic,
detailed study but it lacks even a hint of the notion that
studying normal hyperplasia and its regulation can be
used as a tool in understanding the disease. (2) Schwartz
et al., 1995 "The intima. Soil for atherosclerosis and restenosis" [99], has been cited 586 times. This work actually
advocates the opposite idea – that factors/mechanisms
causing pathology are new and have nothing to do with
the control of normal hyperplasia. Three questions are
formulated in the article, underlying the priorities in studying arterial pathology. One of them (#2) addresses
exactly the topic of the discussion: "What molecules control neointimal formation?" [99]. This question is asked
about pathological intimal hyperplasia or arteriosclerosis.
There are no questions in this article about the control of
normal hyperplasia or its imbalance. This view is repeated
in other publications by the same group, e.g. in the book
"Intimal Hyperplasia" [100]. In a section discussing
mechanisms and models of restenosis, there is only one
line about the similarity between diseased intimal hyperplasia and normal arterial morphology; in contrast, there
is plenty of discussion about molecules originating outside the intimal hyperplasia that could control the pathology [98]. Study of normal intimal hyperplasia regulation
was not even mentioned in the final section "Future
Directions". Therefore, in this matter my opponents
appear to confuse two different states of mind: knowing

facts as a possession of information; and connecting facts
as acquisition of knowledge.
Outcomes of the failure to control and prevent arterial intimal
hyperplasia: chronic rejection of organ transplants as exemplar
Anyone familiar with the problem knows that failure to
control and prevent arterial intimal hyperplasia dramatically affects the outcome of many other disease conditions: peripheral arterial occlusive disorder, graft vascular
disease in transplantation, prosthetic vascular failure, etc.
A classical example of failed treatment strategy is the management of chronic rejection in organ transplantation.
Solid organ transplantation, a relatively new field of medicine, made a tremendous progress in recent decades
including surgical techniques, organ procurement, preservation, matching, prevention and treatment of acute rejection, etc. There was one exception: chronic rejection,
which still disastrously affects the outcome of transplantation as it did decades ago. In my view, the current failure
and lack of feasible solutions to the problem are mainly
due to inconsistent and misleading tentative hypotheses
underlying the current approaches to graft vascular disease.

A pathology of chronic rejection includes a number of features, but only graft vascular disease forms patterns and is
diagnostic [101,102]. In its turn, graft vascular disease
may or may not present as venous pathology, arterial
inflammatory-necrotic damage, atherosclerotic plaques,
or medial or adventitial damage/remodeling. However, it
invariably presents as arterial neointimal formation or
intimal hyperplasia [101,102], the main manifestation of
chronic rejection in solid organ transplantation, less evident in liver [103] and not in lung [101,104,105]. The
main causes of graft vascular disease are assumed to be the
introduction of alloantigens and an activated immune
system [101,106-116]. Although non-immunological factors were considered aggravating and even predictive
[116-119], they have never been considered as pathogenetic causes of chronic rejection. Accordingly, our efforts
have concentrated on immunological mechanisms for
graft vascular disease (GVD).
Because of the prominent and profound arterial pathology in solid organ transplantation, arterial transplant
models were introduced to study chronic rejection [120122]. All these models showed circumferential intimal
hyperplasia, similar to the clinical manifestation of GVD,
and are widely used to study chronic rejection. As
expected, these models were also studied from the standpoint of transplant immunology. Numerous studies
based on immunological models of GVD have reported
successful abrogation or even prevention of chronic rejection in animal models; nevertheless, this laboratory success has never been translated into clinical progress. As a

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

result, our inability to control chronic rejection, together
with an increased shortage of donor organs, has had a catastrophic impact on solid organ transplantation. Because
immunological models of GVD still prevail [123,124], it
would be helpful to test their logical consistency and fitness to empirical observations.
Since arterial allo-transplantation models are widely
accepted for studying chronic rejection, let us consider the
well-known fact that identical neointimal formation
occurs in human autologous arterial grafting [125-130].
These clinical facts are echoed by experimental observations: everyone who studies animal models of arterial
transplantation knows that significant numbers of syngeneic/autologous grafts develop intimal hyperplasia,
more often at anastomosis sites, with some groups reporting that 100% of autologous grafts are affected [131].
However, a general consensus disregards syngeneic/autologous anastomosis intimal hyperplasia by examining
artery cross-sections from the middle of vascular grafts
only. I personally examined more than a thousand grafts
in rodent models of arterial transplantation, and also
found that anastomosis neointimal formation in syngeneic grafts was very frequent. The pathological patterns
of the resultant syngeneic/autologous intimal hyperplasia
are identical to those in diseased arterial allografts. Similar
to other protocols and in accordance with mine, I evaluated sections from the middle of grafts and disregarded
any pathology close to the anastomoses.
These facts lead inevitably to the question: are neointimal
remodelings in allogeneic and autologous/syngeneic
grafts different in nature or the same phenomenon, i.e.
result from the same mechanism(s)? Though at the first
glance this question seems redundant, it is very logical.
We cannot simply exclude autologous/syngeneic arterial
graft pathology from consideration and restrict our analysis to allo-grafting. The only scientific approach to the
problem is to incorporate all facts into the analysis and
suggest one of these alternatives: either both transformations have distinct mechanisms that coincidentally lead to
identical pathology (e.g. structural convergence), or intimal hyperplasia in allo- and autologous/syngeneic grafts
result from the same mechanism. Conventional wisdom
tells that we have to select the simplest explanation [132].
Therefore, unless otherwise proven, we have to suggest
that the same cause underlies intimal remodeling in both
autologous/syngeneic and allografts, just for the sake of
logic. Because no alloantigens are involved in autologous/
syngeneic arterial transplantations, it is logical to ask a further question: why did we assume in a first place that
introduction of alloantigens and activation of the
immune system causes intimal hyperplasia in transplanted arterial allografts, i.e. GVD, i.e. chronic rejection
in solid organ transplantation?

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2007, 4:41

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

The answer is obvious: because GVD occurs after allogeneic organ transplantation and the same introduction of
alloantigens causes a profound phenomenon known as
acute rejection. Indeed, allografts undergo acute rejection,
and to explain this, an idea (due to Sir Peter Medawar and
Sir Frank Burnet) about how the immune system rejects or
accepts tissue transplants was applied. On the basis of this
concept, braking through anti-rejection drug therapy was
created (for review see [133,134]). Nevertheless, although
historically obvious for transplantation, the allo-immune
hypothesis of chronic rejection has produced no progress,
i.e. experimental testing has failed. All approaches to treatment based on the allo-immune hypothesis of GVD failed
to generate progress, and unlike acute rejection, the rates
of chronic rejection have remained largely unchanged
over the decades [135,136]. As a result, our inability to
control chronic rejection, together with an increased
shortage of donor organs, has had a catastrophic impact
on solid organ transplantation, yet we are still using the
same approaches to the problem.

responses, to smaller domains such as soluble and membrane-associated antigens, complements, etc. Whatever
has been suggested as causation within immunological
models has failed experimental tests. Did we abandon this
hypothesis? Not at all, it is still the main approach to
chronic rejection, though it is now customary to speak of
a "cytokine milieu". We now seem to be working with
hypotheses that are not falsifiable.

In short, the alloimmune hypotheses of GVD have failed
experimental tests, have a logical flaw and do not fit
observations. Rationally, alloimmune models should be
rejected. It does not matter that we do not know yet the
cause of uncontrolled intimal hyperplasia in the complication named "chronic rejection". We simply have to
refute the failed hypothesis, suggest others and test them.
Freeing analysis from pathogenetic bias is not just logical,
it is imperative for scientific progress. A hypothesis is a
tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test
its logical or empirical consequences [137]. Therefore,
asking questions from the standpoint of inconsistent and
failed hypothesis can only generate misleading answers.
Nevertheless, the failed hypothesis still prevails
[123,124].

"Naive coronary vessels may appear to have intimal thickening histologically characteristic of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV)." from abstract-VS.

Main-stream research on arterial intimal hyperplasia continues to
base approaches on inadequate hypotheses
I included the foregoing synopsis of chronic rejection for
two reasons. First, I have studied chronic rejection over
the last 15 years with a growing realization that there is
logical inconsistency in this field, and this was a topic of
the first version of this analysis. Secondly, I see it as a very
clear example of the disconnection between observations
and scientific reasoning on the one hand and explanatory
hypotheses on the other. Therefore, it is not just a failure
of certain treatment strategies, it is much worse – it is a
persistent failure to address the problem. Everything that
could be considered as part of immune regulation or
remotely associated with it has been suggested as cause
and thoroughly tested, and it has failed to produce results.
This claim does not even require references; it covers everything from large domains such as innate and adaptive
immunity, cellular and antibody-mediated immune

To date, arteriosclerosis research has taken no cognizance of
fundamental facts about arterial morphology, and these facts must
be re-discovered
While working on this analysis I came across one recent
publication with mixed feelings. A research group from
Boston published an extremely important report that is
worth quoting. For the first time in modern periodical
publications, clinical researchers put a much needed question mark in the title of this article: "Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy: Real or a Normal Morphologic Variant?".
Houser and co-authors [138] wrote:

"However, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 4, in a notable
number of vessels in naive and native hearts, the smooth
muscle cells' expanding intimae lacked this neatly regular
pattern. Ignoring this finding could result in a diagnosis of
CAV when, in fact, no CAV is present."from discussion-VS.
Considering that most researchers in cardiology still
believe that normal intimal hyperplasia is confined to closure of the ductus arteriosus [139], the significance of this
report [138] for the entire field of arterial pathology cannot be overestimated. On the other hand, it clearly indicates that the most advanced research groups in the field
are not fully aware of the normal coronary artery phenotype [53-55,57-68,70,72-74,76-78,140-149] or of the
possible implications of this normal regulation for
pathology.
One might suppose that, since the publication of this
breakthrough report [138], we should expect changes in
the perception of the disease and approaches to its solution. However, I remain skeptical. I wish to be wrong, but
judging from history, it is very unlikely.
Concern has been expressed about the lack of attention to
fundamental properties of arterial structures in medical studies
Two decades earlier, the renowned UK pathologist Collin
L. Berry wrote in chapter 3 ("Organogenesis of the Arterial
Wall") of the monograph "Diseases of the Arterial Wall"
[150], original French edition "Maladies de la paroi arter-

ielle" [150], in the synopsis "Exceptional areas in vascular
development":
"There is a considerable body of literature on the significance of what have usually been described as "endothelial
cushions", mainly in coronary arteries (see Robertson
(44) for review of early literature). Robertson concluded
that the lesions, which could be found in other arteries,
were not related to subsequent atherosclerosis but were
normal growth phenomenon. These studies however, and
the subsequent careful work of the Velicans (55,56), have
been ignored in recent years." [151]
Experience shows that that Berry's assessment was not
only correct, but unfortunately predictive of the following
twenty years. But are we experiencing déjà vu?
More than five decades previously, Nikolay N. Anitschkow wrote in the chapter "Experimental arteriosclerosis in animals" of the book "Arteriosclerosis. A Survey of
the Problem", edited by Edmund V. Cowdry [152], in the
section subtitled "Interpretation of experimental intimal
thickening":
"... in evaluating the significance of the thickening of the
intima, as observed by various authors, it is important to
remember that thickening of the intima also occurs in
experimental animals as a purely physiological phenomenon
in the process of aging. In this respect, the arteries of some
animals exhibit almost the same conditions that are
observed in human arteries, as may be seen from Miss
Wolkoff's investigation (1924). In the view of the fact that
some authors mentioned above did not pay any attention
to this circumstance, the experimental results reported by
them can be accepted only with very great reservations"
(pp. 275–276).
Further, in subchapter IV, "Spontaneous arterial changes
in animals", Anitschkow wrote:
"Another circumstance that should not be left out of
account by any author interested in the experimental
induction of atherosclerosis is the frequent occurrence of
spontaneous arterial changes in certain species of animals as
described in chapter 6". (p. 276) [153].
Let us not forget that N. Anitschkow (alternatively spelt
"Anichkov") is a Russian pathologist famous for his seminal theory on the "cholesterol pathogenesis" of arteriosclerosis, and his pioneering work on arteriosclerosis
modeling [153-155]. Anichkov's work is considered
among the greatest medical discoveries of the 20th century [156,157]. Can we find any consequence of these
straightforward notions written by one the most influential scientists in the field? See above.

The pioneering work of Richard Thoma on normal arterial intimal
hyperplasia
But if we wish to trace the origin of this conceptual
approach to arterial design, we have to look back more
than a century to the work of Richard Thoma of Heidelberg, a founder of the modern arterial pathology. Over
more than forty years, Thoma published observations and
hypotheses in series of articles in leading pathology journals about the resemblance between normal intimal
hyperplasia and arteriosclerosis in the umbilical artery,
ductus arteriosus, different segments of aorta, coronary
artery and other arteries. Thoma hypothesized that arterial
intimal thickening is a physiological adaptation to changing haemodynamic demands [53,54,140]. In his publications Thoma uses the German "Neubildung" or
"Gewebsneubildung" to describe new (tissue) formation
without transformation, i.e. normal hyperplasia. To
describe diseased hyperplasia, he adds "Angiosklerose"
and "Angiomalacie".

In "Über die Intima der Arterien", Virchows Archiv, 1921,
320,1:1–45, among many descriptions of normal arterial
intimal hyperplasia at various sites, Thoma writes in the
Conclusion (pp:44–45):
"According to these general effects, the neoplasia of connective tissue which occurs following birth in the umbilical bloodstream, appears as a necessary consequence of
the conditions present. The closing of umbilical arteries
and the Botallian duct produces a considerable increase in
the amount of blood flowing through the descending
aorta and Art. iliacae comm. per unit of time, since the
peripheral areas of circulation of the lower extremities and
the rest of the body at first receive no greater amounts of
blood than before....".
"....The retardation of the stream thus triggers, according
to the first histomechanical laws of bloodstream, a neoplasia in the intima, which narrows the opening of the
vessel. Through this increase in thickness of the intima, on
the one hand, and on the other hand, as a result of growth
of the media in these arteries, delayed by the tonic narrowing, normal speed of peripheral bloodstream is
restored during the period of 2 to 5 years....
"The exact same relationships arise in angioslerosis, with
the difference that vessel tonus is destroyed as a result of
angiomalacia. Angiomalacia becomes the cause of diffuse
and circumscribed, passive distension of vessel walls
through the pressure of blood. These distensions of the
arterial wall result in greater or smaller retardations of
peripheral bloodstream, which, under the exhausted
tonus of the media, lead to diffuse and circumscribed neoplasia in the intima. This neoplasia in the intima is in the
beginning at times rich in elastic and muscular elements,

when through blood pressure or as a result of widening of
the opening the tension of the wall is increased. When,
however, mechanical tensions of the vessel wall are moderated, either through hypertrophic thickening of the
media or though a strong increase in the thickness of the
intima, then the endothelium goes on to produce primarily connective structures, which correspond to moderated
mechanical tensions." [54] (Translation from the German
by [158].
Confirmation of Thoma's hypothesis of the remodeling of normal
intimal hyperplasia
More recently, Thoma's hypothesis of the remodeling of
normal intimal hyperplasia has been further investigated
and subjected to experimental testing. It has been unequivocally confirmed in a number of elegant studies [159173], leading to advanced modeling such as the Glagov
and Kamiya-Togawa models. A very powerful conformation of the "slow flow" effects on expansion of hyperplasia
and arterial narrowing was reported by Karino-Goldsmith
group [174-181]. Results of this group, obtained in fascinating experiments on transparent arteries with preserved
geometry, including human arteries, directly showed that
disturbed or slow flows are associated with excessive
hyperplasia [174-181]. Significance of precise direct
observations on fluid mechanical factors influencing intimal hyperplasia, and thereby connecting the models to
coronary diseased hyperplasia, cannot be overstated. This
seems a particularly striking example of the disconnection
among scientific fields that are in effect concerned with
the same phenomenon; indeed, notable scientists have
contributed to this work [164,169,171,181,182] and published it in journals that are dedicated to arteriosclerosis.
The past 50–60 years have yielded no new conceptual ideas about
arterial intimal hyperplasia pathology and we no longer expect any
Richard Thoma was the first to enunciate a conceptually
motivated approach to the problem. In my view, this was
the foundation of his tremendous personal achievement
in the field of arterial pathology, and for the extremely
important observations and conclusions made by scientists whom his ideas inspired [159-161,163-173,181184,187,188].

Even during his lifetime, Thoma had been criticized for
omitting lipid depositions in intimal hyperplasia from his
model [189]. Indeed, lipid deposition in intimal hyperplasia had already been noted by Rudolf Virchow [190]
(cited from [189]). This phenomenon inspired Anitschkow's work [153-155], opening a new chapter in the
study and prevention of arterial disease. Again, in my
view, a conceptually motivated approach to the problem
was the driving force behind Anitschkow's achievement
and the tremendous clinical success that came from it.

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

However, scientific reality comprises a natural sequence of
events; and – as has happened before – any productive
theory may cease to be useful when applied beyond its
limits. Even worse, it may become a dogma monopolizing
research and slowing progress [40,41,191]. The "cholesterol" hypothesis still is the best explanatory model for
certain clinical observations, but not for all. It took a long
time before a prestigious medical journal – the NEJM –
became open to discussion about the "cholesterol
monopoly" [192-194]; though surprisingly, previous
publications challenging the "cholesterol" dogma [195197] were not mentioned. My point, however, is that Anitschkow's work was, and inspired, a conceptually motivated approach to the problem, and that is why it resulted
in tremendous success.
No new conceptual ideas seem to have arisen during the
past 50–60 years of study of arterial neointimal formation
in either field of medicine. More dangerously, we have
grown accustomed to having no new ideas. I share the
opinion that the idea is more important than the experiment [198], and without drastic changes in the perception
of the problem, progress is very unlikely. I proposed a
hypothesis aimed at incorporating all facts related to intimal hyperplasia, and analyzed the problem from the
viewpoint of established biological knowledge.
A unifying hypothesis
Observations on intimal hyperplasia that may be connected and
explained by the hypothesis
First, I shall enumerate all the facts that I suggest are interrelated and should therefore be explained by one hypothesis.

Arterial intimal hyperplasia (IH) is a distinct arterial tissue
formation or arterial phenotype that manifests as follows:
(1) IH appears in the inner compartment of the arterial
wall, the "intima", as a multi-cellular layer as distinct from
the single-cell-layer endothelial lining.
(2) IH always occurs under normal conditions in all airbreathing vertebrates from lungfish to mammals in one
strictly predetermined arterial location: the sixth pharyngeal arch artery or its derivatives (the ductus arteriosus, otherwise known as the Botallian or Botalli duct). Closure of
the ductus arteriosus separates the pulmonary and systemic
arterial blood flows, permanently or temporarily
[199,200].
(3) IH always occurs under normal conditions in the uterine arteries in placentals of various taxonomic orders
[201-212], and probably in all placentals. It participates
under normal conditions in the closure of umbilical arteries in humans [213-215]. This closure has been studied in

Page 8 of 20

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2007, 4:41

the distal part of the umbilical cord, and I suggest that it is
the main mechanism sealing the vessels in the proximal
part, i.e. the navel.
(4) IH always occurs as the standard design of major arteries in all placental mammals at least as large as rabbits,
including humans [53][54-67,72][73-76,78,138][140149][150-152][153]This morphogenesis does not have a
completely predetermined location, but occurs most frequently in arterial sites proximal to highest blood pressure
[64]. This arterial phenotype possesses great dimensional
variability in respect of location, vascular length affected
and intimal width.
(5) IH normally occurs and increases with age in at least
two peripheral limb arteries in humans [216] and probably in other big arteries [78].
(6) IH occurs under normal conditions as the standard
arterial system design in two other taxa of vertebrates:
birds and marsupials [56,64,217,218].
(7) IH also occurs under normal conditions as the standard design of low limb veins in humans [219].
(8) Under disease conditions (both clinical and experimental), IH is manifest in vessels of all types, including
prosthetic, if they constitute part of the arterial system.
These manifestations show striking variations in location
and extent, and the associated disease conditions show
similarly striking variations in nature and magnitude.
These pathological hyperplasia formations occur as:

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

(6) arterial neointimal hyperplasia formation resulting
from any solid organ allo-transplantation, except lung;
(7) neointimal hyperplasia formation on the inner surface
of prosthetic vascular grafts, bare [233,234] or pre-seeded
with endothelial cells [235-238];
(8) arterial neointimal hyperplasia formation after cessation of blood flow [239].
Hypotheses about arteriosclerosis and restenosis that fail to
incorporate normal intimal hyperplasia and consider only the
pathology are logically inconsistent
In my view, this logical flaw generates misplaced questions and accumulates misleading answers. For this reason I omit discussion of other traditional hypotheses of
IH, e.g. the inflammatory hypothesis of arteriosclerosis
and restenosis [240-247], since there is no inflammation
behind normal intimal hyperplasia. The alternative
assumption – that an undetectable degree of subtle
inflammation always exists in arteries – ultimately makes
such hypothesis unfalsifiable and thereby useless.
Origin of cells forming arterial intimal hyperplasia
The origin of cells forming arterial intimal hyperplasia
have been shown to be:

(1) residual endothelial cells;
(2) residual smooth-muscle cells;
(3) residual adventitial cells [248];

(1) spontaneous excessive intimal formation at normal
arterial hyperplasia sites (e.g. coronary artery), carotid
artery [220] and aorta, more often close to the ductus arteriosus [221-223];

(4) residual transdifferentiated cells [249];

(2) spontaneous neointimal hyperplasia formations at
sites that normally express the single-layer intimal arterial
phenotype (e.g. peripheral arterial disease, more often in
limbs [224-228], mesenteric artery system [229,230], or
sometimes in multi-organ arteries [231] together with
aortic coarctation [232]);

(6) cells of either donor or recipient origin or both in
transplantation models;

(3) neointimal hyperplasia formation of autologous arterial grafts;
(4) neointimal hyperplasia formation of autologous
venous grafts in arterial location;
(5) neointimal hyperplasia formation occurring in
response to local insults to arteries in situ, regardless of the
original intimal phenotype. The nature and magnitude of
the insults are extremely variable;

(5) different progenitor cells, residual or bone-marrow,
including neural-crest-derived progenitors [250];

(7) cells of unspecified origin except residual smoothmuscle cells [251-253], based on the fact that in these
models, all residual smooth-muscle cells die before hyperplasia formation begins.
These facts about intimal hyperplasia (different normal
and pathological manifestations, as well as different cell
origins) can, in my opinion, have only one explanation.
Hypothesis about arterial intimal hyperplasia
The hypothesis states that:

Arterial intimal hyperplasia is a phenotype or biological
trait that has evolved and been selected as normal arterial

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2007, 4:41

morphogenesis, initially as an adaptation facilitating air
breathing in anamniotes (forebears of lung fish), then, as
the two circulations separated and the lung was bypassed
during amniotic embryogenesis, facilitating closure of the
ductus arteriosus after hatching in amniotes (forebears of
reptiles), and then as an adaptation to increasing arterial
blood pressure (increased body weight, variations in anatomical design, upright body posture, etc.), to preserve
arterial integrity and to regulate blood flow to comply
with local physiological demands. The cellular source for
this morphogenesis may be any cells that colonized and
survived in the intimal compartment. These comments
are not new; they are stated here to ensure the logical
coherence of what follows.
Since individual variability is a fundamental property of
all species, this morphogenetic reaction cannot be absolutely pre-programmed in terms of either location or
extent, except for a few locations – the ductus arteriosus and
the umbilical and, probably, uterine arteries.
In both phylogeny and ontogeny, vertebrates display great
variation within and between taxa, affecting individual
body weight (exceptions are [254,255]), posture, anatomy, behavior pattern, etc.. These variations are ultimately associated with variations in arterial pressure, even
within homogeneous groups of the same species [256259]. We know that significant variations in blood pressure correlate with variations in normal intimal phenotype; specifically, high blood pressure correlates with
normal intimal hyperplasia in arteries proximal to heart
[53-56,58-65,67,72-78,138,140,153,160,260][261264][265]. What mechanisms could control this morphogenesis? Obviously, the requisite information cannot be
controlled by cellular DNA alone, for two reasons: (1) this
morphogenesis occurs in response to positional forces in
the arterial system, which cannot be strictly predetermined for any given organism; and (2) it is facilitated by
cells with different differentiation potentials. The only
logical solution is that in addition to genomic information, (1) the arterial system itself instructs the intimal phenotype, (2) this information must be arranged in certain
patterns along the heart-periphery axis, and (3) under
normal conditions, local expression of a specific phenotype depends on the hydrodynamic properties of the
blood flowing in contact with the intima.
This mechanism was initially proposed by Thoma
[53,54,140] and more recently tested, confirmed and further elaborated [159-161,181,266,269]. Together, these
facts offer a sound explanation of how the intimal hyperplasia phenotype arises proximal to the heart in the normal arterial tree, depending on the hemodynamics of
blood flow, and changes with location along the heartperiphery axis. However, neither the Thoma's original

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

[53,54,140] nor adapted [176,180-184] models can
explain pathological hyperplasia, clinical or experimental,
that is not preceded by changes in hemodynamics and
shear stress, nor can they explain intimal hyperplasia in
prosthetic vessels. However, the Thoma, Glagov and
Kamiya-Togawa models and Karino-Goldsmith' observations offer a consistent explanation for pre-interventional
in situ diseased hyperplasia (arteriosclerosis) as well as for
the beneficial effects of cardio-vascular exercise [270,271].
Disease-related arterial intimal hyperplasia not preceded by changes
in hemodynamics and shear stress
To explain disease-related hyperplasia that is not preceded
by changes in hemodynamics and shear stress, I hypothesize that the arterial blood-tissue interface itself (as a topological entity) imposes properties that support the
development of intimal phenotypes, initiating mechanisms of cell selection and intimal morphogenesis. This
morphogenesis could be directed to the formation of
either a single-cell-layer intima ("ideal intima") or multilayer cellular compartment (intimal hyperplasia). We
already know that cells of different origin can form intimal hyperplasia. The same is true for single-cell-layer
intima. The hypothesis suggests that any cells capable of
colonizing the arterial blood-tissue interface, naturally or
in remodeling, acquire by default the capacity to activate
genes that are necessary for producing intimal phenotypes. Note that "arterial blood-tissue interface" is defined
differently from the traditional "blood-tissue interface",
i.e. endothelium [272]. In my model, the term denotes
the topological area where blood flow meets surrounding
structures, and it includes descriptions such as "basement
membrane on which the inner cell lining of vessels rests"
or "proteins, glycoproteins and other molecules, including artificial ones, that appeared in fixed positions and
form structures in contact with the moving blood. This
includes dead vessel wall, prosthetic vascular grafts, autologous and allogeneic vascular grafts, and naïve arterial
vessels in any location.

The assumption that the arterial blood-tissue interface
facilitates the formation of intimal phenotypes arises
from the endothelialization and hyperplasia formation in
vascular prostheses, and from observations on intimal formation after initial necrosis of an entire arterial wall in
animal models [251-253]. We also know from nascent
vessel formation that angiogenesis and blood formation
are reciprocally-inducing events [273-277]. Some observations also indicate vessel-related positional information, in traditional cell biology models and in pathology
[200,262,278-281]. Recent in vitro experiments [186-188]
suggested that blood flow (a moving fluid) possesses sufficient information to invoke specific endothelial differentiation and vascular development. The particular
properties of blood flow that initiate vascular differentia-

tion remain unidentified, but the phenomenon of blood
flow-dependent vascular morphogenesis is clearly apparent [185].
Any cell selected by its ability to colonize the arterial blood-tissue
interface acquires the ability to express either intimal phenotype,
regardless of cell origin
Therefore, I suggest that any cells that are capable of colonizing the arterial blood-tissue interface (i.e. attaching
and surviving) acquire the ability to form an intimal phenotype. This acquisition of ability entails the activation of
gene regulatory cascades for expressing intimal phenotypes. Under this hypothesis it does not matter whether
the cells are of donor or recipient origin, resident or
blood-borne or trans-differentiated, etc.; nor does it matter whether the vessel is a residual artery, natural or prosthetic graft. Once selected by their ability to remain at the
interface, or prompted to differentiate to such state from
residual sources, cells acquire the ability to enter intimal
morphogenesis. The cells that appear in the innermost
position are endothelial cells, by topological default and
regardless of heterogeneity [282]. After cells have colonized the arterial blood-tissue interface, basal membrane
components, regulatory molecules in the blood and the
mechanical properties of blood flow can further direct
intimal differentiation [186-188,283,284].
The disease state involves no new mechanisms that stimulate the
millions of cells constituting the intimal compartment simultaneously,
but pre-existing normal mechanisms could be unbalanced by various
non-specific or triggering stimuli
Furthermore, the hypothesis suggests that the basic phenotype, i.e. the single-layer endothelial lining, is dominant because the mechanism for producing a multi-layer
phenotype is normally suppressed. Thus, there is a balance between positive and negative processes, a dual control, which is common in biology. Under normal
conditions, the mechanism for producing a multi-layer
phenotype or intimal hyperplasia could be activated by
mechanical forces or by the positional information associated with such forces. But in normal conditions, even
activated multi-layer morphogenesis is controllable, presumably under negative regulation. For disease conditions, malfunction of either regulatory arm would
ultimately result in imbalance, which, as we know, is
always manifesting in uncontrolled intimal proliferation.
Thus, the hypothesis implies that the disease state
involves no new mechanisms that stimulate the millions
of cells constituting the intimal compartment simultaneously, but pre-existing normal mechanisms could be
unbalanced by various non-specific or triggering stimuli.

Relationships between arterial hyperplasia remodelings of different
origins
It may be objected that unrelated facts have been conflated, and that relationships that do not exist in reality
should not be investigated; in other words, that my quest
rests on a false premise. Certainly, it may be argued that
normal coronary hyperplasia has nothing in common
with hyperplasia in prosthetic vessels, and GVD is unrelated to peripheral arterial occlusive disorder, or to the
ductus arteriosus, etc. It is a valid argument, but before
responding I would like to ask more questions that we
usually avoid:

Is intimal hyperplasia after coronary interventions (restenosis) the same phenomenon as pre-interventional coronary intimal hyperplasia?
Is pre-interventional coronary intimal hyperplasia is the
same phenomenon as intimal hyperplasia in peripheral
arterial occlusive disorder?
Is intimal hyperplasia after coronary angioplasty the same
phenomenon as cardiac graft arteriosclerosis?
Is normal coronary hyperplasia the same phenomenon as
post-transplanted cardiac arteriosclerosis?
Is intimal hyperplasia in a transplanted heart is the same
phenomenon that affects a transplanted kidney?
Is intimal hyperplasia in autologous vascular grafts is the
same phenomenon that affects allogeneic vascular grafts?
Is intimal hyperplasia of the ductus arteriosus the same
phenomenon as intimal hyperplasia in autologous/allogeneic vascular grafts?
Is intimal hyperplasia in autologous/allogeneic vascular
grafts the same phenomenon that causes failure of synthetic vascular grafts?
Do we believe that the diseased intimal hyperplasia we
study in experimental models is the same phenomenon
we deal with in the clinic?
Do we believe that intimal hyperplasias in different experimental models represent the same phenomenon?
Do we believe that the normal hyperplasias that occurs in
the arterial systems of three taxa of vertebrates (birds, marsupials and placentals) are the same phenomenon?
Are all the above morphogeneses the same phenomenon
or are we dealing with morphological convergence?

Although these questions may seem redundant or paradoxical, they have to be answered because they constitute
a quest for similarity, analogy and homology. This is the
most important quest in biology, for the following reasons.
Determination of analogy and homology in biological science
Medicine is a part of biology. When the nature of a biological characteristic (trait or pathological pattern) is obscure
or unclear, the main approach is to search for possible correlations between multiple observations, including an
event of interest. When correlations are found, the next
step is to examine whether they are analogous or homologous in nature.

Analogous traits have common function but originate in
very distant phylogenetic taxa/structures. The wings of
insects and the wings of birds are analogous traits and different genomic mechanisms are responsible for their
development and differentiation. In contrast, homologous structures evolved from the same primordial structure in a common forebear. For example, the wings of
bats, the pectoral fins of dolphins and the arms of humans
are homologous owing to their shared ancestry. The same
gene expression cascades can be tracked in the development of homologous structures, while non-homologous
(analogous) structures, although similar in function, are
result from different mechanisms. Consider the following: one and a half century ago, Alexandr Kovalevsky, a
Russian founder of comparative embryology, demonstrated similarities in embryonic development between
Amphioxus lanceolatus, tunicates and vertebrates [285].
Kovalevsky considered these similarities homologous and
unified all three taxa in one phylum, Chordates, placing
Amphioxus in the ancestral position. In 1994 a comparative analysis of Hox gene clustering in mammals and
amphioxus revealed similar genomic organization, showing that indeed amphioxus is a living ancestor of mammals [286]. Classifying a set of observations as
homologous or analogous is the most valuable tool in
biology. The entire Darwinian concept, as well as modern
biology, is based on determinations of homology.
The intimal hyperplasia phenotype is a selected biological trait and
should be approached in terms of homology
A biological characteristic that occurs in the same anatomical conduit (arterial intima) of almost all related species,
and is manifest in pathological states in these species, cannot be an accident and is very unlikely to result from unrelated mechanisms. All biological understanding tells that
it is a selected trait. The alternative assumption simply
denies the past 150 years of biological science together
with Darwin's concept. In my view, the pronouncement
that "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

of Evolution" [287] constitutes a valuable scientific tool
and not just a political statement.
Therefore, my hypothesis rests on fundamentals of biology. It also rests on the knowledge that if a unifying explanation for a set of presumably related observations exists,
that explanation should be given priority for experimental
testing rather than a number of separate explanations, one
for each observation. The application of intuitive knowledge such as the Principle of Parsimony has certain limitations in science, including that in traditional biological
modeling [288], but it is still a useful guide in formulating
hypotheses.
The analysis has certain implications and offers scientific tools for the
study of the disease
What scientific tools does my analysis provide, and what
implications does it offer? The most important implication is: we have to change all our approaches to the problem drastically, since they omit fundamental biological
evidence and have been shown to be fruitless and misleading. This topic has been considered in great detail by
philosophers of science [39-41,191,289] and need not be
analyzed here, but we ought to stop deceiving ourselves.
We ought to stop pretending that measurable associated
parameters collected from diseased patients constitute
causal information about diseased intimal hyperplasia.
Our experience and accepted hypotheses have not produced feasible candidates for such causation. Knowing
where to go and where not to go is essential. We have been
testing the same failed hypotheses and using the same
fruitless approaches recurrently for decades. Billions of
dollars have been spent in the attempt to understand what
could possibly unbalance an obscure mechanism, and not
even a tiny fraction of this funding has been spent on
studying the mechanism itself. We ought to stop the endless arguments about the origin of cells in diseased hyperplasia, because this quest is pointless. We ought to admit
that statements typically found in articles and grant proposals such as "causative mechanisms of transplant vasculopathy are not completely understood" can only deceive.
We do not have a hint about the causative mechanisms.
Therefore, titles such as "fighting coronary disease",
"fighting restenosis", or "fighting chronic rejection"
sound very attractive to the public and for fundraising, but
they are misleading from both medical and scientific
standpoints. We ought to use biological knowledge and
approaches to study diseased hyperplasia because we are
dealing with a biological trait.

In fact, these various observations can no longer be
viewed as coincidental, yet no one seems willing to verbalize the problem. As Wallitt et al. put it: "Therefore treatments meant to bypass vessels are themselves affected by
the very malady they are deployed to treat; it would seem

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2007, 4:41

that biology is not without a sense of irony" [290]. I perceive the problem quite differently: when normal intimal
hyperplasia is considered as a biological trait and normal
IH in coronary arteries as a basic phenotype, and in the
light of pre-existing IH in the vascular grafts we use for
bypass [219], the real and very sad irony stems not from
biology but from our inability to notice and understand
all these messages that biology sends to us.
We must also urgently revise the way we teach arterial histology and
pathology to medical students
This revision is not about educational methodology, it is
simply about teaching facts and the omission of facts. If
leading medical scientists are harboring such dramatic
misconceptions about normal coronary artery design and
are re-discovering obvious facts, as evident from [138],
then medical education itself is jeopardizing progress. I
feel it necessary to re-emphasize my point here: I think
that Houser and co-authors [138] have made the most
important observation ever in the field of transplant arteriosclerosis, but this later admiration does not negate the
former evaluation. The view that diseased coronary hyperplasia is qualitatively different from the normal coronary
hyperplasia is no longer tenable.

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/41

It is very unproductive to approach the problem from the
point of view of information we do not know yet, or what
other molecules could be studied. From what we have
learned about proteins that show deviant expression associated with the disease, of which there are already dozens,
it is literally impossible to test even a fraction of the possible combinations. I think we can use our existing knowledge about the subject to forge useful tools. I strongly
believe that, collectively, we already know enough to
approach the problem from different and more productive viewpoints if we could overcome the information gap
between medicine and biology, and between the different
fields of medicine that are in effect studying the same phenomenon. We have to put together all the facts and suggestions currently stored in different knowledge clusters. I
hope that my analysis may initiate scientific exchange
between different fields and facilitate approaches to the
problem, although its complexity and magnitude requires
nothing less than a community-wide effort. We cannot
afford to allow inertia to overtake our research. Diseased
intimal hyperplasia, the main pathological manifestation
in a variety of arterial disorders, continues to be the
world's leading cause of death.

Predictions of the hypothesis and priorities in intimal hyperplasia
research
My hypothesis predicts that the gene regulatory cascades
governing this morphogenesis in its different manifestations, including diseases, are homologous. If identified, a
real regulatory cascade rather than numerous transposable non-specific signals would be a therapeutic target. It
also predicts that coronary arteries in animals of more
than a certain size should form a multi-layer intimal compartment regardless of taxonomic position. For example,
a capybara, the biggest living rodent reaching body
weights up to 70 kg [291], should have normal intimal
hyperplasia in its coronary arteries. This hypothesis, in
addition to logic, internal integrity, appeal to common
sense and support from different bodies of knowledge,
possesses one essential feature: it is falsifiable.

GVD – graft vascular disease

In the Background section of this article, I stated that two
questions should inform the priorities of our research: (1)
what controls switch the single cell-layer intimal phenotype into normal hyperplasia? (2) how is normal (benign)
hyperplasia maintained?

References

Do I know the answers to these questions? Unfortunately,
the answers to these questions remain unknown; I can
only offer a hypothesis. But I am convinced that as long as
we approach the problem from false premises, we are
fated to accumulate misleading and fruitless answers.
