Construction of a potato consensus map and QTL
meta-analysis offer new insights into the genetic
architecture of late blight resistance and plant
maturity traits
Sarah Danan1, Jean-Baptiste Veyrieras2, Véronique Lefebvre1*

Abstract
Background: Integrating QTL results from independent experiments performed on related species helps to survey
the genetic diversity of loci/alleles underlying complex traits, and to highlight potential targets for breeding or QTL
cloning. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) late blight resistance has been thoroughly studied, generating mapping
data for many Rpi-genes (R-genes to Phytophthora infestans) and QTLs (quantitative trait loci). Moreover, late blight
resistance was often associated with plant maturity. To get insight into the genomic organization of late blight
resistance loci as compared to maturity QTLs, a QTL meta-analysis was performed for both traits.
Results: Nineteen QTL publications for late blight resistance were considered, seven of them reported maturity
QTLs. Twenty-one QTL maps and eight reference maps were compiled to construct a 2,141-marker consensus map
on which QTLs were projected and clustered into meta-QTLs. The whole-genome QTL meta-analysis reduced by
six-fold late blight resistance QTLs (by clustering 144 QTLs into 24 meta-QTLs), by ca. five-fold maturity QTLs (by
clustering 42 QTLs into eight meta-QTLs), and by ca. two-fold QTL confidence interval mean. Late blight resistance
meta-QTLs were observed on every chromosome and maturity meta-QTLs on only six chromosomes.
Conclusions: Meta-analysis helped to refine the genomic regions of interest frequently described, and provided
the closest flanking markers. Meta-QTLs of late blight resistance and maturity juxtaposed along chromosomes IV, V
and VIII, and overlapped on chromosomes VI and XI. The distribution of late blight resistance meta-QTLs is
significantly independent from those of Rpi-genes, resistance gene analogs and defence-related loci. The
anchorage of meta-QTLs to the potato genome sequence, recently publicly released, will especially improve the
candidate gene selection to determine the genes underlying meta-QTLs. All mapping data are available from the
Sol Genomics Network (SGN) database.

Background
The number of publications reporting the mapping of
QTLs (quantitative trait locus) in plants has exponentially increased since the Eighties, reaching a total of
about 34,300 papers in 2010 (source: Google Scholar
with key words “QTL” and “plant”). For a few species
only, this huge amount of QTL data has been recorded
in databases that enable quick comparison of QTL

mapping results from independent experiments (e.g.
Gramene for maize and rice). But for most species, QTL
data accumulates in bibliography until the coming out
of hot-spot genomic regions that become targets for
introgression into breeding material or for cloning. To
get a comprehensive understanding of the genetic control of a polygenic trait and to optimize its use in breeding, it is needed to get a complete view of the genetic
architecture of the trait with the distribution of the
involved loci along the genome. This synthesis can be
greatly facilitated by achieving a QTL meta-analysis.
The general principle of a meta-analysis is to pool the
results of several studies that address the same issue to

improve the estimate of targeted parameters. Metaanalysis was first used in social and medical sciences,
like epidemiology. More recently, it was applied in plant
genetics to combine on a single map the genetic marker
data and the QTL characteristics (location, confidence
interval, effect and trait used for QTL detection) from
independent QTL mapping experiments to finally estimate the optimal set of distinct consensus QTLs, called
meta-QTLs. The positions of those meta-QTLs are estimated with a higher accuracy as compared to the individual QTLs in the original experiments [1]. To date,
QTL meta-analyses have been achieved for traits related
to plant development and plant response to environment (nutrients, abiotic and biotic stresses) in maize,
wheat, rice, rapeseed, cotton, soybean, cocoa and apricot
[2-18].
Statistical methods have been proposed for the metaanalysis of QTLs from several experiments. The method
proposed by Goffinet and Gerber (2000) was implemented in the Biomercator software [1,19]. It compiles the
QTLs that have been projected on an existing reference
map and uses the transformed Akaike classification criterion to determine the best model between one QTL,
two QTLs, three QTLs etc. until the maximum number
of QTLs mapped in the same region. This method was
first used by Chardon et al. (2004) and by most authors
until recently [2,3,6,8-10,15,16]. Then Veyrieras et al.
(2007) have extended the statistical method and implemented the new algorithms in the MetaQTL software
[20]. MetaQTL notably uses a weighted least squares
strategy to build the consensus map from the maps of
individual studies and offers a new clustering approach
based on a Gaussian mixture model to define the optimal
number of QTL clusters or meta-QTLs on each chromosome that best explain the observed distribution of the
individual projected QTLs. The Gaussian mixture model
has shown to be flexible and robust to the non-independence of the experiments [4]. Moreover, simulations
demonstrated that the number of meta-QTLs selected by
the Akaike criterion is lower than the expected number
with random distributions of QTLs and that it has a very
low probability to happen by chance [4]. The MetaQTL
software has successfully been used in wheat, maize, rice
and apricot [4,5,12,13,17].
Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) late blight resistance is
typically a trait for which meta-analysis can be applied.
From 1994 to 2009, 19 studies have been published on
QTL mapping in different crosses and with different
related species, generating a significant amount of QTL
data. All these publications reflect the interest of the
potato scientific community towards polygenic partial
resistance to late blight. Late blight, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most serious
diseases in potato, which is the third most important

food crop in the world after rice and wheat. Almost all
Rpi-genes (R-genes to P. infestans) deployed in the potato
fields have been rapidly overcome, while polygenic resistance appears to be a fairly efficient and durable alternative. However, it has been observed that this kind of
resistance in potato is often associated with plant maturity, as most resistant plants are also the ones that mature
the latest. This is a handicap for breeders and growers
who aim to get early maturing plants to shorten the time
of tuber production.
Attempts to get a synthetic view of the loci controlling
polygenic late blight resistance in potato with comparison of their positions with maturity QTLs have already
been published [21,22]. However, because of a lack of
common markers, the comparison of QTLs was
achieved at a half-chromosome scale, which made the
compilation imprecise. Consequently, to enhance the
comparison of QTL positions coming from different
mapping studies and also to refine the localization of
hot-spot genomic regions, the mapping of common
markers between maps is crucial.
Reference dense maps constructed with transferable
markers are privileged sources of common markers.
A UHD potato map containing 10,000 AFLP markers
has been designed to become a reference map [23,24].
However, the anchorage of AFLP markers is restricted
to closely-related species. In addition, as the comparison
is based on the comigration of the marker bands on the
gel, AFLP gels are required, which does not make the
comparison easy to achieve [25]. Other reference maps
containing SSR and RFLP markers have been developed
in potato (SSR maps [26-28]; RFLP map [29]). These
markers are well defined by specific primers or a probe
sequence, which makes them easily transferable from
one cross to another, even between distantly related species; they are thus handy tools for map comparison.
A functional map for pathogen resistance, enriched
with RGA (resistance gene analog) and DRL (defencerelated locus) sequences, SNPs and InDels tightly linked
or located within NBS-LRR-like genes, has been developed on the basis of two potato populations (BC9162
and F1840 [30-33]; PoMaMo database [34]). This functional map also contains CAPS, SSR and RFLP literature-derived markers, which enables the comparison
with other QTL maps. However, it remains difficult to
infer precisely functional locus information to QTL
mapping results as QTLs often have large confidence
intervals.
QTL meta-analysis thus appears here to be an adequate tool i) to narrow-down the confidence intervals of
hot-spot loci where congruent late blight resistance
QTLs of multiple origins map, and ii) to investigate
colocalization of these loci with Rpi-genes, RGAs, DRLs
and maturity QTLs as well. In this paper, we present a

three-step meta-analysis process achieved with the
MetaQTL software. First, we built a consensus potato
map by compiling 21 QTL maps and eight reference
maps. This consensus map includes common markers
and specific markers tagging Rpi-genes, as well as RGA
and DRL markers. Second, individual QTLs for late
blight resistance and maturity were projected onto the
consensus map. Third, for each trait, QTLs were clustered into meta-QTLs on the basis of the distribution of
their projected positions on the consensus potato map.

Results
Bibliographic review of QTL mapping studies

The initial map set comprised a total of 37 maps divided
into i) 29 QTL maps from 19 publications related to
QTL detection of late blight resistance and maturity
type, and ii) eight independent reference maps (without
any QTL) (Table 1). Reference maps were included
because they provided numerous pivotal markers, which
improved connections between maps. Because of a lack
of shared markers, the initial 29 QTL map set was
refined to a core subset of 21 “connected” QTL maps
coming from 14 publications that were included in the
meta-analysis (Table 1).
The 21 “connected” QTL maps were representative of
the diversity of assessments for late blight resistance and
maturity, the QTL detection methods and the sources
of resistance (Table 2). Resistance tests were based on
disease spread on foliage in the field (FF) or in the
greenhouse (FG), sporulation or necrosis spots on
in vitro detached leaflets or leaf discs (LT), necrosis progression on stems (ST) and disease damage on tuber
slices (TS) or whole tubers (T% or WT) in controlled
conditions. Maturity type was evaluated by the number
of days before flowering or senescence (MT), plant
height (PH) and plant vigour (PV). QTLs were detected
with different statistical detection methods according to
the number of available markers, the size of the progeny
and the frequency distribution profile of the raw or

transformed data (non-parametric statistical tests or
ANOVA, Interval Mapping, Composite Interval Mapping or Multiple QTL Mapping with permutation tests).
Most of the P. infestans isolates used for late blight
resistance assessments were of A1 mating type and virulent towards the 11 S. demissum Rpi-genes. However, it
was difficult to say whether some of the isolates used in
the different studies were the same or not. As wild
tuber-bearing relatives of potato have proven to be
high-potential sources of resistance, most mapping
populations derived from a cross between a dihaploid
S. tuberosum clone (the susceptible parent) and a clone
derived from a diploid relative (the resistant parent).
Two mapping populations even derived from crosses
between two potato relatives (without S. tuberosum,
Table 2). The parental pedigrees were sometimes quite
complex. Nevertheless, the marker order in all maps
was well conserved and aligned with the S. tuberosum
map [35,36]. If all known species of the parent pedigrees
are taken into account, a total of 13 potato-related species were involved in the meta-analysis.
Consensus potato map

Common markers between the 21 “connected” QTL
maps and eight reference maps (Table 3) made it possible the construction of a consensus map for the 12
potato chromosomes. The number of maps used to construct each consensus chromosome varied between 20
and 25 (Figure 1). The consensus potato map had a
total length of 1,260 cM (Haldane) and contained a total
of 2,141 markers (SSR, SSCP, CAPS, RFLP, AFLP, SNP,
InDels and STS markers). Among them, 514 markers
were shared by at least two different maps. There were
between 28 and 58 common markers per chromosome,
corresponding to 16% up to 29% of the total number of
markers per chromosome. The name, map position and
occurrence of each marker are given in Additional file 1
and on the SGN database [37].

††† 8 reference potato maps without QTLs (listed in Table 3) were added to
meta-analysis to increase connections between maps through common
markers and to improve consensus map accuracy.

On the basis of the 19 publications of QTL studies, a
total of 211 late blight resistance QTLs and 64 maturity QTLs were collected (Table 1). However, some
QTL intervals did not include the minimum of two
anchor markers, which were required for their projection onto the consensus map. Thus, the QTL dataset
for meta-analysis was reduced down to 144 late blight
resistance QTLs and 42 maturity QTLs, coming from
14 publications. The excluded QTLs, which harboured
a single common marker with the consensus map,
were referred to “anchored QTLs” and indicated at
this marker position in Additional file 1 but their
orientation and projected confidence interval could not
be determined.

As far as the QTLs included in the meta-analysis are
considered, late blight and maturity QTLs spread on the
12 potato chromosomes. The number of QTLs per
chromosome ranged between six and 21 for late blight
resistance, and between one and eight for maturity.
For late blight resistance, R² values were available for
106 QTLs out of the 144 input QTLs and ranged
between 4% (chromosome I, foliage test [38]; chromosomes V, IX, XI, XII, foliage test [39]) and 63% (chromosome X, tuber test [40]). 75% of the late blight QTLs had
relatively small effects, ranging between 4% and 15%; 7%
of the QTLs had large effects, ranging between 30% and
63%. Confidence intervals ranged between 3 cM (chromosome III, leaf disc test [41]) and 66 cM (chromosome
VI, foliage test [42]), with a mean of 24 cM.
For maturity, R² values were available for 20 QTLs out
of the 42 input QTLs and ranged between 4% (chromosomes IX and XII [39]) and 71% (chromosome V [42]).
75% of the maturity QTLs had R² values ranging between
4% and 15%; 10% of the QTLs explained more than 30%
of the phenotypic variation (60% and 71% on chromosome
V [42]). Confidence intervals ranged between 4 cM

(chromosome XI [42]) and 61 cM (chromosome VI [42]),
with a mean of 20 cM.
Meta-analysis

We determined the number of meta-QTLs per chromosome by using the modified Akaike Information Criterion
(AICc) and by taking into account the consistency with
the different criteria provided by the MetaQTL software
(Additional file 2). Our analysis yielded a total of 32
meta-QTLs. Each meta-QTL corresponded to clusters of
individual QTLs coming from different experiments.
Meta-QTLs were composed of a maximum of 18 individual QTLs for late blight resistance (chromosome V) and
eight individual QTLs for maturity (chromosome V). The
QTL meta-analysis on the whole potato genome reduced
by six-fold the initial number of late blight QTLs by passing from 144 QTLs to 24 meta-QTLs and by ca. fivefold the number of maturity QTLs by passing from
42 QTLs to eight meta-QTLs. Figure 2 presents an example of the meta-analysis steps for chromosome IV, from
QTL projection on the consensus map to QTL clustering
into meta-QTLs.

Figure 1 Characteristics of the consensus potato map. For each
of the 12 potato chromosomes, the bar represents the total
number of markers, the upper part corresponding to the proportion
of common markers between at least two individual maps. The
length of the consensus chromosome maps in cM (Haldane) and
the number of individual maps used for their construction are
indicated for each chromosome, below the bars.

A graphical overview of the late blight and maturity
meta-QTLs is presented on Figure 3. Late blight metaQTLs spread on the 12 chromosomes, with one to three
meta-QTLs per chromosome. Maturity meta-QTLs
spread on only six chromosomes, with one or two metaQTLs per chromosome. Other maturity QTLs were
reported in literature on the other six chromosomes,
but they were single in their region and no meta-QTL
could be computed. Single QTLs for late blight resistance and for maturity that were excluded from the
clustering step are shown in Additional file 1, with the
other excluded QTLs which were anchored by a single
marker to the consensus map.
The confidence intervals of late blight meta-QTLs
ranged between 0.27 cM (chromosome VII) to 49.81 cM
(chromosome I), with a mean of 10.25 cM (SD±10.79).
The confidence intervals of maturity meta-QTLs ranged
between 0.88 cM (chromosome V) to 39.28 cM (chromosome VI), with a mean of 10.67 cM (SD±12.54).
With respect to the length reduction of the mean confidence interval from the published QTLs to the metaQTLs, confidence intervals were reduced by 2.3-fold for
late blight resistance and by 1.9-fold for maturity (Additional file 3).
Maturity meta-QTLs overlapped late blight metaQTLs on chromosomes VI and XI, while there was no
overlap on chromosomes IV, V, VII and VIII. However,
by running meta-analysis on late blight resistance QTLs

and maturity QTLs altogether under a single “supertrait”, we observed that for all 12 chromosomes, maturity QTLs were always clustered together with late blight
resistance QTLs in a “super meta-QTL” (data not
shown). On the other way round, we observed at least
one “super meta-QTL” free of maturity QTLs for 11
chromosomes; for chromosome XI only, both “super
meta-QTLs” included at least one maturity QTL.
The three most consistent late blight meta-QTLs were
located on chromosomes IV, V and X (MQTL_1_Late_blight of chromosome IV, MQTL_1_Late_blight of
chromosome V and MQTL_2_Late_blight of chromosome X; Additional file 3). These meta-QTLs were composed of the highest number of QTLs (10 to 18 QTLs)
with the largest effects (R² up to 63%, tuber test [40]).
In addition, they corresponded to individual QTLs identified in different potato-related species or in plant
material with complex pedigree. This result suggests
that these regions could correspond to conserved resistance QTLs retrieved from several tuber-bearing Solanum species.
Candidate gene analysis

Literature reported the map positions of several Rpigenes determining late blight resistance (reviewed in
[43,44]). However, only a few flanking markers were supplied (Rpi-genes were linked to a single marker or
included in a large marker interval), which hampered the
accurate location of Rpi-genes on the consensus map
(Additional file 1). Due to their rough positions, it was
thus not possible to say definitely whether they were
included or not in the late blight meta-QTLs. Out of the
33 Rpi-genes positioned on our consensus potato map,
10 were included in the confidence intervals of late blight
meta-QTLs (Table 4). One example of overlap was on
chromosome IV, where the TG370-TG339 marker interval (~12 cM) containing a large NBS-LRR Rpi-gene cluster (R2-like genes) largely overlapped the meta-QTL
MQTL_1_Late_blight [45]. On chromosome VI, the
CT119 marker tagging the Rpi-blb2 R-gene was included
in MQTL_1_Late_blight. On chromosome X, the TG422
and TG403 markers flanking the Rpi-ber2 gene were
included in MQTL_2_Late_blight. However, on chromosome XI, the lack of anchor markers hindered the accurate location of the 10 Rpi-genes (Rpi-Stirling, R5 to R11,
R3a and R3b). According to the flanking markers
(STM5130-STM5109 for Rpi-Stirling, TG105-GP250 for
R3a, TG26 for R3b and R5 to R11), only Rpi-Stirling
might be included in MQTL_2_Late_blight.
Conversely, a few Rpi-genes clearly did not belong to
any late blight meta-QTLs. This was the case for Rpi1
on chromosome VII and for the Rpi-vnt1, Rpi-phu1 and
Rpi-mcq1/moc1 loci of chromosome IX. In three additional cases, the distinction between Rpi-genes and late

Projected QTLs (quantitative trait loci) are represented by vertical bars to the left of the consensus chromosome IV. Their length is representative
of their confidence interval once projected on the consensus map. They are sorted into assessment type, within late blight resistance traits (Leaf
disc, Leaflet, Whole tuber, Tuber slice, Stem, Foliage in field), on one hand, and within maturity traits (Maturity, Vigour), on the other hand. QTL
names are written to the left of the bars. QTL nomenclature is as follows: the name of the first author of the original publication juxtaposed to
the last two digits of the publication year, the name of the population consensus map or of the parental map where the QTL was detected, and
an Arabic number that can be followed by a letter. This latter Arabic number is the number of the chromosome juxtaposed to the QTL
mapping order on the chromosome; a letter was sometimes added to distinguish colocalizing QTLs that were detected with different traits. For
Leonards-Schippers et al.’s study, the original name of the QTL was added [41]. Ticks on the consensus chromosome indicate marker positions.
Marker names are only shown for markers that occur at least in four maps out of the 21 compiled maps. Vertical thick bars to the right of the
consensus chromosome indicate Meta-QTLs. Late blight meta-QTLs are in black and maturity meta-QTLs are in grey. Their length is
representative of their confidence interval. To show clearly the results of the clustering step, the QTLs or part of the QTLs that were assigned to
the ‘MQTL_1_Late_blight’ meta-QTL are in plain line and those assigned to the ‘MQTL_2_Late_blight’ meta-QTL are in dotted line. The QTL

gene (BA213c14 and BA87d17 BACs) was located less
than 2 cM far below the lower bound of MQTL_1_Late_blight. On chromosome VIII, the RB cluster (Rpiblb1, Rpi-pta1, Rpi-plt1, Rpi-sto1, tagged by RB marker)
was located 1 cM far up to the upper bound of

MQTL_2_Late_blight [46]. On chromosome X, the
Rber/Rpi-ber1 locus was located between both metaQTLs of this chromosome, in a 3-cM interval (Additional file 1).

late blight meta-QTLs that covered about 20% of the
consensus map (Table 4). Comparatively, 24 RGAs and
nine DRLs belonged to maturity meta-QTLs that covered about 7% of the consensus map (Additional file 1).
Independency Chi-2 tests indicate that the number of
RGAs and Rpi-genes are under expectation in late blight
meta-QTLs (p-value=0.035 under the hypothesis of
independency) and over expectation in maturity metaQTLs (p-value<0.0001). The heterogeneous distribution
of RGAs and Rpi-genes corroborate the fact that they
are often clustered or alleles. Conversely, the distribution of DRLs was independent on the distribution of
both late blight meta-QTLs (p-value=0.323) and maturity meta-QTLs (p-value=0.909).

Discussion
A dense consensus reference potato map for map
comparisons

Twenty-nine published potato maps were merged
together into a single consensus map. From the information available in the publications of the genetic maps,

at least three maps come from the cultivated potato species (S. tuberosum) and 23 maps from crosses between
S. tuberosum and potato wild relatives (S. microdontum,
S. phureja, S. sparsipilum, etc., Tables 2 and 3). Sixteen
maps are already consensus maps of both parents, with
generally one being a S. tuberosum clone and the other
one a resistant wild potato species. This ability to compile genetic map information of S. tuberosum and its
wild relatives indicates a high level of conservation of
the marker order, and thus, of genomic sequences all
over the genome. This stresses the very close genetic
relationships of those genetic backgrounds and gives evidence of the validity to compile their deriving published
QTL data produced with their maps. The genetic relationships between the cultivated potato and its wild relatives have been described in details by Spooner et al.
(2008) [47].
Composed of 2,141 markers, the consensus map constructed in our study constitutes a new valuable dense
reference map of potato. Marker positions are available
on the SGN database, enabling map comparisons
[37,48]. This map can be used either as a source of

markers for regions of interest or as an anchor reference
map. However, for regions with a high density of markers, precise marker order has to be taken with care as
the marker positions were calculated according to the
positions of common markers from different maps and
not based on recombination fractions. Thus, precise
marker positions have to be checked by mapping in a
large population.
One feature of this consensus map is that markers are
not regularly spread along the chromosomes and tend
to concentrate in the medium regions. For example, on
chromosome VIII, 18 markers are spread on the top
71 cM while 167 markers are spread on the next 29 cM.
This phenomenon is indeed observed on the published
maps where dense regions are often assimilated to centromeric regions characterized by a small number of
recombinations and consequently compressed maps. We
also assume that genomic regions known to be involved
in late blight resistance mostly gather in medium
regions, which had been enriched with markers.
Another explanation would be that distal markers generally originate from a single published map and their
positions could be due to genotyping errors or skewed
segregations.
A clear picture of the structural organization of late
blight resistance loci on the potato genome

The synthetic potato map with meta-QTLs offers a
refined overview of the structural organization of the
loci of polygenic resistance to late blight in terms of
number of QTLs and lengths of confidence intervals. By
reducing the number of resistance loci by a factor of six
(from 144 QTLs to 24 meta-QTLs), meta-analysis highlights the well-known resistance gene clusters on chromosomes IV and V, and also points out loci which had
not appeared as notable in individual experiments like
the loci on chromosomes I, III, VII, and XII. Twentyfour meta-QTLs summarized about 96% of the individual QTLs included in the analysis, which illustrates the
power of QTL meta-analysis to combine QTLs from
various studies.
One may question the validity of such QTL meta-analysis compiling information of as different species as the
cultivated potato (S. tuberosum) and its wild relatives
(S. stenotomum, S. berthaultii, S. bulbocastanum, etc.).
However, as we explained earlier, this meta-analysis
could only be performed thanks to the presence of common molecular markers mapped in a conserved order
across maps of different related species. This structural
tight genetic relationships of the different backgrounds
sets up the hypothesis that the same genes are present
in the same order in the genome across species, and
that the genetic variation, if any, would take place at the
allele level. The fact that the Potato Genome Sequencing

Page 10 of 16

Consortium is currently exploiting the high genomic
similarity between S. tuberosum and S. phureja to
reduce the complexity in assembly supports this hypothesis [49]. A high level of sequence conservation was also
observed at the nucleotide level of the coding sequence
among six Solanaceae genera (potato, tomato, pepper,
petunia, tobacco and Nicotiana benthamiana) [50].
Because the number of sequence matches among different Solanaceae EST libraries was inversely correlated
with the phylogenetic distance, we assume that the
tuber-bearing species are also very similar at the level of
expressed genes. These hypotheses have been already
proposed in other genera where meta-analysis was conducted across relatives (e.g. for cotton fiber [15] and for
rice blast [2]). In potato, resistance QTLs from one
population frequently mapped, as far as resolution
allows, in close proximity to those described in other
populations. At the gene level, high sequence homology
of Rpi genes were described between potato relatives.
Functional homologues of the R2 resistance gene to
P. infestans located on potato chromosome IV were
cloned by an allele mining approach in three related
species, and recognized the same effector protein of
P. infestans [45]. Rpi genes and their general functions
are overall well conserved across potato related species,
variation being in fact limited to differences at the base
pair and allele function levels [51]. At last, in a recent
published study, meta-analysis was performed on populations involving different species related to bread wheat
to narrow-down the interval of a QTL controlling the
nitrogen use efficiency [52]. The functional underlying
gene has been identified and showed to be conserved at
orthologous positions in wheat species and in much
further related cereals species such as rice, sorghum and
maize. These different elements demonstrate that the
analysis of the genetic factors controlling a trait across
genomes of different related species and even of different genera of a plant family can be very powerful to perform a map-based dissection of a conserved gene that
controls the same trait in several species.
In our study, the locus confidence intervals have been
reduced by 2.3-fold in average. Locus accuracy has especially increased for the loci for which colocalizing QTLs
are numerous, like on chromosome V where 18 colocalizing QTLs with an averaged confidence interval of
23 cM were clustered into a single meta-QTL of only
5 cM. In this way, meta-analysis refines the genomic
regions of interest frequently described. This enables the
determination of a set of markers for selection and a
reasonable list of candidate genes when the genetic map
is anchored to the annotated genome sequence. The closest flanking markers of the locus are also provided for
subsequent fine-mapping in a real large population for
map-based gene cloning.

Danan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/16

However, confidence intervals of meta-QTLs have to
be taken with caution, as they are the result of two successive statistical transformations (projection onto a consensus map and clustering), based themselves on the
individual QTL confidence intervals. This stresses the
importance of the accuracy of the initial mapping data.
For our analysis, we took into account the individual
QTL confidence intervals as described in the original
publication when available (interval length of a certain
LOD decrease). Otherwise, the confidence interval estimate was calculated with the empirical formula of Darvasi and Soller (1997) whose accuracy depends on the
population size and the QTL effect [53]. To reduce the
risk of giving artificially too much weight to a locus, we
made a quite strict selection of the individual QTLs to be
included in the meta-analysis by removing all possible
redundancy (e.g. several repetitions or related traits in
the same experiment). In our study, five meta-QTLs
displayed confidence intervals lower than 1 cM (on chromosomes III, V, VII, VIII and XI), while the confidence
interval of individual QTLs varied greatly. In these
regions, the consensus map appeared condensed in comparison with the original maps; therefore, the projected
confidence intervals of individual QTLs were very tight.
Löffler et al. (2009) have also found in wheat a very tight
meta-QTL of 0.1 cM that encompassed six QTLs only
[12]. These over-reduced confidence intervals underline
the necessity to validate the marker-trait association,
either by association mapping or by transcriptomics
when possible as performed by Norton et al. (2008) [14].
The meta-analysis implemented by the Meta-QTL
software assumes that QTL experiments are independent from each other. Therefore, it could not take into
account common features to several studies, such as the
relatedness between mapping populations or between
Phytophthora isolates that would have increased the
power of the analysis. Nevertheless, by projecting QTLs
on the same consensus map, meta-analysis still makes it
possible to rapidly compare QTL mapping results of
linked studies and highlights QTLs conferring isolatespecific resistance (same population and assessment but
different isolates [54,55]) or with tissue-specificity effect
(same population and isolate but assessments on foliage
and tuber [35,40]). Another limit of the meta-analysis
implemented in MetaQTL is that it does not provide
the direction of the allelic effects, meaning that QTLs
composing a meta-QTL can have opposite direction
alleles. Consequently, we have to come back to the individual QTL data to be able to select the origin of the
target favourable allele.
Polygenic late blight resistance and maturity relationships

Late blight meta-QTLs overlapped maturity meta-QTLs
on chromosomes VI and XI. In addition, if we consider

Page 11 of 16

individual maturity QTLs excluded from the meta-analysis but anchored with a single common marker, other
overlaps were presumed with late blight meta-QTLs on
chromosome I, II, V, and XII, and reciprocally individual
late blight QTLs overlapped maturity meta-QTLs on
chromosomes IV, V, VI, VII, and XI (Additional file 1).
In these cases, either pleiotropic genes might control
both traits, or the resolution is not accurate enough to
distinguish two closely linked genes.
The most famous association between QTLs for late
blight resistance and for maturity is located on the
upper part of chromosome V [39,40,42,55-57]. Here,
meta-analysis results show that the maturity meta-QTL
MQTL_1_Maturity consisting in eight maturity QTLs
reported for this chromosome was very close but distinct from the most consistent late blight meta-QTL
MQTL_1_Late_blight consisting in 18 individual QTLs.
This result goes rather in favour of the hypothesis that
each trait would be controlled by independent genes but
very closely linked. Nevertheless, this result has to be
taken with care as two individual maturity QTLs that
were not included in the meta-analysis were anchored
to markers of the confidence interval of MQTL_1_Late_blight. Also, another individual late blight QTL was
anchored to a marker of the MQTL_1_Maturity’s confidence interval (Additional file 1).
Cases of clearly distinct maturity and late blight metaQTLs were found on chromosomes IV, VII and VIII; the
hypothesis of a pleiotropic gene would then be excluded
for these regions. In addition, anchored individual maturity QTLs did not coincide with late blight meta-QTLs on
chromosomes III and X, corroborating the independence
of late blight and maturity loci in these regions as suggested in previous studies [39,40,55,58]. The clearest
cases of physical independency between maturity and
late blight resistance QTLs could be preferential targets
for introgression into elite cultivars for late blight resistance breeding.
Candidate genes for late blight resistance QTLs

Most frequent hypotheses about resistance QTLs were
either defeated R-genes with residual effects or defence
genes. The confidence intervals of the late blight metaQTLs of chromosomes IV, VI, X and XI include
R-genes of the NBS-LRR class (R2 cluster, Rpi-blb2, Rpiber2 and Rpi-Stirling respectively). The late blight resistance locus of chromosome IV was particularly well
documented with the Stirling cultivar and S. microdontum cases of study [55,59,60]. The detection of the same
locus as an R-gene or a QTL can be accounted for several factors such as the allelic form of the gene (for
instance, defeated complete resistance alleles could be
detected as QTLs), the composition of the pathogen isolate, the way of scoring the disease or the genetic

Danan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/16

background. Bhaskar et al. (2008) demonstrated that the
resistance level conferred by the RB gene was dependent
on the quantity of proteins encoded by the essential cell
cycle regulator SGT1 gene. This showed the importance
of the genetic background in the efficiency of R-genetriggered disease resistance [61]. A parallel can be made
with the fact that quantitative resistance is often controlled by a few large-effect QTLs in association with
several minor-effect QTLs which can interact with the
major QTLs to modulate the expression of the given
trait (reviewed in [62]).
By analysing colocalizations between the 24 late blight
meta-QTLs and the 33 Rpi-genes, 80 RGAs and 72
DRLs, we observed that 25% of late blight meta-QTLs
included RGAs (33% included Rpi-genes or RGAs), and
50% included DRLs. It also appeared that the frequency
of RGAs was not significantly greater inside late blight
meta-QTL confidence intervals than outside, and that
DRLs were neither significantly associated with late
blight meta-QTLs, nor with maturity meta-QTLs. Even
if our analysis was biased by the limited number of candidate genes and QTLs, our results do not favour one
particular hypothesis for molecular basis of resistance
QTLs rather than another, corroborating Ballini et al.’s
conclusions [2]. However, the meta-analysis presents the
advantage to reduce QTL confidence intervals, which
contributes to increase the resolution in selecting relevant candidate genes. As an example, the StAOS2 gene
encoding the potato allene oxide synthase 2 was located
within the MQTL_2_Late_blight’s confidence interval.
Pajerowska-Mukhtar et al. (2008) showed that the natural variation of this gene was associated with a late
blight resistance QTL identified by Oberhagemann et al.
(1999) [63,64]. Such congruency between meta-analysis
and fine mapping results was also reported for the Vgt1
QTL in maize [20,65].

Conclusions
In our study, we produced the first consensus map and
performed the first meta-analysis dealing with both
development trait and resistance to a biotic stress in
potato. Through this study, we demonstrated that, as
soon as a large amount of QTL data is collected from different studies and connected by common genetic markers, meta-analysis becomes a powerful tool to highlight
chromosomal regions to focus further researches on and
to use in breeding. To narrow-down the target loci confidence intervals, it is thus worth systematically integrating
all new QTLs into meta-analysis on a regular basis. The
anchorage of the new annotated potato genome sequence
to meta-QTLs will especially provide interesting targets
for candidate gene approach and for marker-assisted
breeding [66]. Meta-analysis could also be useful for
comparative QTL mapping across widely related crops of

Page 12 of 16

the same family, as achieved between rice and maize [67].
This opens a new type of analysis that would integrate
gene evolution and functional conservation.
To improve meta-analysis, it would be necessary to
integrate the relationships between parental clones
across experiments, along with their pedigree, to be able
to determine the donors of resistant alleles. In addition,
adding information on P. infestans isolates used for
resistance assessments would enlighten on the resistance
spectrum mediated by meta-QTLs, which is one of the
predictors of the durability of resistance to pathogens.
We assume that broad-spectrum meta-QTLs probably
target essential functions of the pathogen and that
meta-QTLs supported by QTLs detected from several
genitors or related species probably provide a selective
advantage. Consequently, we presume that meta-QTLs
with a broad-spectrum and retrieved from different
genitors correspond to constrained genes, and could
therefore be preferential targets to increase the durability of the resistance.

Methods
Consensus potato map

The construction of the consensus map was performed
chromosome by chromosome. To be able to align the
chromosome maps in the right orientation, a chromosome of a study should contain a minimum of two common markers with the corresponding chromosome of
another study. QTL maps that did not share common
markers were discarded from the construction of the
consensus map. For several maps, few chromosomes
were also missing, which lead to a variation of the number of input maps depending on the chromosome
(Figure 1).
In case of inversions of two markers between maps,
only the marker that was present in the lowest number
of maps was manually removed to ensure that the most
frequent common markers would be systematically
retained. We repeated this process until no more inversion was observed between maps.
The ConsMap command of the MetaQTL software
version 1.0 was used to create the consensus marker
map [20]. The implemented method is based on a
Weighted Least Square (WLS) strategy, which made it
possible to compile all the input maps into a consensus
map in a single step. It takes into account the distances
between adjacent markers from all individual maps
rescaled in Haldane unit. The size and type of the mapping population are used to estimate the map accuracy
and are integrated into the compilation. Marker names
and positions were provided in the input map files,
along with a file specifying the synonymous names of
the same markers that were mapped in different maps
(Additional file 4 and on the SGN database [37]).

QTL meta-analysis

QTL meta-analysis was performed with the MetaQTL
software version 1.0 [20]. MetaQTL requires a minimal
set of descriptors characterizing each observed QTL: the
QTL position, its confidence interval and/or its individual R² value (at least one of them is mandatory), the
trait related to the QTL and the size of the QTL mapping population used for the QTL detection. The statistical method implemented in the MetaQTL software
hypothesizes that the input mapping studies are independent from each other. QTL mapping studies, which
were repeated in time and space, often detected redundant QTLs at the same position for the same trait. In
that case, we kept only the QTL with the highest effect
(R²) to avoid the attribution of a too strong weight to
that QTL in the meta-analysis.
QTLProj command enabled the homothetic projection
of the positions and the confidence intervals of the individual QTLs onto the consensus map. It is based on a
scaling rule between the positions of the flanking markers of the QTLs on their original maps and the positions of these markers on the consensus map. The
MetaQTL software first took into account the confidence interval reported in the study if available, otherwise an estimation of the confidence interval was
calculated using the empirical formula proposed by Darvasi and Soller (1997) [53]: CI=530/NxR², where N is
the population size and R² the QTL effect as reported in
the individual study. This formula generally gives larger
confidence interval than the usual interval length of
LOD-1 decrease. We used trait ontology to classify and
group original trait names according to their relatedness.
QTLClust command performed the clustering of the
projected QTLs referring to the same trait on a given
chromosome into all possible numbers of hypothetic
clusters or “models”, i.e., from the model consisting in
only one hypothetic cluster to the model consisting in
as many clusters as the total number of individual QTLs
reported for the chromosome. For a given model, a
Gaussian mixture approach was applied to jointly perform a quantitative clustering of the projected QTLs
and estimate meta-QTL positions and confidence intervals by maximizing the likelihood of the initial QTL
positions. The clustering could only be performed in the
genomic regions where at least two QTLs overlapped. If
QTLs were single in a genomic region (referred as outlayer QTLs in Additional file 1), they were excluded
from the clustering step.
QTLModel command determined the best clustering
model based on information-based criteria that were
computed for each possible model: AIC (Akaike information criterion), AICc, AIC3, BIC (Bayesian information criterion) and AWE (average weight of evidence)
[20]. The best model was the one which criteria values

Page 13 of 16

were the lowest relatively to the criteria values of the
other possible models. It corresponds to the optimal
number of clusters that best explain the observed QTL
distribution along the consensus chromosome map. As
a result, each meta-QTL position and confidence interval correspond to the consensus position of all the individual QTLs attributed to this meta-QTL, weighted by
their individual accuracies and probability of being
attributed to the meta-QTL.
A two-round QTL meta-analysis was adopted. First, a
meta-analysis was performed by declaring late blight
resistance distinct from maturity in the trait ontology;
separated meta-QTLs were thus obtained for each trait
in the same analysis. In the second round of QTL metaanalysis, both traits were merged into one single “super
trait”. The purpose of this second round was to investigate whether maturity QTLs tended to cluster with late
blight resistance QTLs or not. For convenience, metaQTLs of late blight resistance were called “late blight
meta-QTLs”, and meta-QTLs of maturity, vigour and
plant height were called “maturity meta-QTLs”.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Description of the consensus map with meta-QTLs
positions, additional individual QTLs, Rpi-genes, RGAs and DRLs.
The chromosome Arabic numbers, the locus names, and the positions of
the loci on the consensus map (in cM, Haldane unit) are listed in the
ascending order of marker positions, from chromosome I to
chromosome XII. The occurrence number of the markers across the 21
compiled maps is indicated (meta.occurrence). The “type” information
indicates whether the locus is a marker (M) or a meta-QTL (Q). If the
marker sequence has been previously described as being a resistance
gene analog (RGA) or a defence-related locus (DRL) (information mainly
retrieved from the PoMaMo database), the type “M_RGA” or “M_DRL” is
mentioned; in this case, a short description about the sequence is added.
Rpi-gene (R-gene to Phytophthora infestans) most probable locations are
indicated by shaded areas between their two closest flanking markers, as
described in literature. Unless markers were designed from known Rpigene sequences (as for RB gene), Rpi-genes have most of the time an
approximate location on the consensus map. Overlapping locations of
Rpi-genes in the same region are indicated in two different columns of
the table. Rpi-genes with different names are considered as being
different genes, even if they are alleles [44].The columns “qtl.ci.from” and
“qtl.ci.to” indicate the range of the meta-QTL confidence interval on the
consensus map. In the table, the confidence intervals of late blight metaQTLs are framed in blue while those of maturity meta-QTLs are framed
in red, and overlapping regions in purple. The column “meta-QTL trait”
specifies the meta-QTL trait: late blight resistance (Late_blight) or
maturity (Maturity).The columns “anchored QTL, trait” and “outlayer QTL,
trait” show additional QTLs that have not been compiled in the final
meta-analysis. The QTL nomenclature is described in the Figure 2 legend.
For “anchored QTLs”, the final number is the chromosome number
alone; for “outlayer QTLs”, the final number is the chromosome number
juxtaposed to the QTL mapping order on the chromosome and a letter
was sometimes added to distinguish colocalizing QTLs that were
detected with different traits. The trait with which the QTL was detected
is indicated after the comma by the trait code, as defined in the Table 2
legend."Anchored QTLs” are QTLs from non-compiled maps and they
could only be anchored to the consensus map if the confidence interval
comprised a common marker; they are mentioned at the position of the
common marker. No confidence interval information is available."Outlayer
QTLs” are QTLs from compiled maps and, as they were alone in their

Danan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/16

region on the consensus map, they eventually could not be clustered
with other QTLs in a meta-QTL. Confidence intervals of these “outlayer
QTLs” are represented by dotted areas.
Additional file 2: Criterion values of the meta-QTL models. The
values of the AIC, AICc, AIC3, BIC and AWE criteria provided by the
MetaQTL software are listed for the twelve chromosomes (first column),
for both maturity and late blight resistance traits (second column), and
for all possible meta-QTL models (third column, K is the number of
hypothetic meta-QTLs of a model). “Delta” is the rescaled value of the
criterion, it is the difference between the value of the given model and
the value of the best model. The weight is the “weight of evidence” of
the model, the higher it is, the more confidence we can have in the
corresponding model.
Additional file 3: Meta-QTL details: number per chromosome,
confidence intervals and composition in published QTLs. For each
chromosome, late blight and maturity meta-QTLs are described. MetaQTL numbers, names and confidence intervals (CI, in cM, Haldane unit)
are specified. The QTL composition of each meta-QTL is detailed by
giving the individual QTL names, the species origins of the mapping
parents (when pedigrees are known), R² values (if specified in the original
publication) and confidence intervals as described in the original
publication (in their original unit, Haldane or Kosambi) with their means
for each meta-QTL. The confidence intervals of the projected QTLs with
their means are also indicated. The QTL nomenclature is described in the
Figure 2 legend. For Villamon et al. and Leonards-Schippers et al.’ studies,
the original name of the QTL was added [36,41]. When QTLs are equally
shared by two meta-QTLs, they are shown in italic (’LB’ for late blight
resistance). The mean of the original confidence intervals of the QTLs
and the number of the QTLs composing the meta-QTL are given for
each meta-QTL. NA: not available.
Additional file 4: Synonymous names of markers described in the
compiled published maps. Marker names that were the most often
encountered for a marker and which had a familiar nomenclature were
considered as standard names. Their corresponding synonymous marker
names that were found in the compiled maps were collected. Only
standard names were used in the final consensus map.
