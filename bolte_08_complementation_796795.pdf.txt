Abstract
Background: Cryptophytes are highly compartmentalized organisms, expressing a secondary
minimized eukaryotic genome in the nucleomorph and its surrounding remnant cytoplasm, in
addition to the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion and the plastid. Because the members of the
nucleomorph-encoded proteome may contribute to essential cellular pathways, elucidating
nucleomorph-encoded functions is of utmost interest. Unfortunately, cryptophytes are inaccessible
for genetic transformations thus far. Therefore the functions of nucleomorph-encoded proteins
must be elucidated indirectly by application of methods in genetically accessible organisms.
Results: Orf222, one of the uncharacterized nucleomorph-specific open reading frames of the
cryptophyte Guillardia theta, shows homology to slr1649 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Recently a
further homolog from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was characterized to encode a phycocyaninβ155-bilin lyase. Here we show by insertion mutagenesis that the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
slr1649-encoded protein also acts as a bilin lyase, and additionally contributes to linker attachment
and/or stability of phycobilisomes. Finally, our results indicate that the phycocyanin-β155-bilin lyase
of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 can be complemented in vivo by the nucleomorph-encoded open
reading frame orf222.
Conclusion: Our data show that the loss of phycocyanin-lyase function causes pleiotropic effects
in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and indicate that after separating from a common ancestor protein,
the phycoerythrin lyase from Guillardia theta has retained its capacity to couple a bilin group to
other phycobiliproteins. This is a further, unexpected example of the universality of
phycobiliprotein lyases.

Background
Phycobiliproteins are subunits of the major accessory

light-harvesting complexes (LHC) of most cyanobacteria
and red alga and are present in the thylakoid lumen of

cryptophytes as well. Covalently linked to the proteins are
chromophore groups, the phycobilins [1,2]. These open
tetrapyrrole rings are coupled to conserved cysteine residues via a thioether bond and are necessary for light harvesting and efficient energy flow [3]. Various
phycobiliproteins, namely allophycocyanin, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, phycoerythrocyanin, carry different
numbers of bilin groups.
Attachment of bilins to phycobiliproteins is an enzymatically catalyzed reaction, which also occurs spontaneously,
but at low efficiency [4]. Several bilin-attaching lyases are
described. One of the dimeric enzymes encoded by cpcE
and cpcF genes links the chromophore to the phycocyanin
α-subunit [4,5]. PecE and pecF genes encode the second
known lyase, specific for the phycoerythrocyanin α-subunit [6-8]. Recently Zhao and co-workers discovered that a
CpeS-like protein functions as a phycocyanobilincysteine-beta84 lyase in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, which
was the first lyase identified for a β-subunit of a phycobiliprotein [9]. Another lyase specific for a β-subunit of a
phycobiliprotein was found by Shen et al. [10]. They identified the gene product of cpcT to be a Cys-β153-phycocyanobilin lyase in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Moreover,
Zhao et al. reported the Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 CpeS1 as
a "near-universal" lyase for cysteine-84-binding sites in
cyanobacterial phycobiliproteins [11,12].
In most cyanobacteria and red algae phycobiliproteins are
organized in multimeric complexes, called phycobilisomes [13-15]. Their antenna structure, located on the
cytoplasmic surface of the thylakoid membrane, consists
of various linker polypeptides and phycobiliproteins.
Each phycobilisome is on its part a multimeric complex,
composed of a core and several rod structures. Phycobilisomes can be subdivided according to their structure. The
most common type in cyanobacteria, the hemidiscoidal
one, consists of a tricylindrical core and six rods.
Allophycocyanin (AP, λmax = 650 nm) forms the core
structure, connecting the phycobilisomes to the thylakoid
membrane via linker proteins. Rods can be composed of
three different phycobiliproteins: phycocyanin (PC, λmax =
617 nm) is located proximal to the core, whereas phycoerythrin (PE, λmax = 560 nm) and phycoerythrocyanin
(PEC, λmax = 575 nm) are located distal to the core
[16,17]. The phycobilisome rods of each organism differ
in their phycobiliprotein composition. Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803 harbors hemidiscoidal phycobilisomes. PC,
the only biliprotein in the rod structures in this organism,
is composed of α- and β-subunits. These subunits dimerize to heterodimers, assemble to hexameric (αβ)6 discs,
and are subsequently coupled to each other, as well as to
the AP-core via linker proteins [18,19]. Depending on
their location (in core or rods), and their molecular mass,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/56

linker proteins are divided into four groups [20,21].
Beside their main function of mediating the assembly and
stability of the phycobilisomes, linker proteins also promote energy transfer towards the reaction centres [20].
Guillardia theta is a cryptophyte possessing phycoerythrin
as a phycobiliprotein. The β-subunit is encoded on the
plastid genome [22], whereas the phycoerythrin α-subunits are encoded by a nuclear-located gene family. In the
latter case, the genes encode preproteins containing a tripartite topogenic signal responsible for the translocation
across five biological membranes [23]. Because a wide
range of genomic data exists from this unicellular phototrophic organism, existing knowledge can be used to
reconstruct the biochemistry of these organisms. The elucidation of protein functions encoded by open reading
frames in the nucleomorph genome of Guillardia theta is
of special interest, as this genome is minimized and
should therefore encode only essential proteins. After analyzing the nucleomorph genome data, Orf222 was identified as being homologous to a number of proteins
including Slr1649 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and
CpcT from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Because cryptophytes are inaccessible to genetic manipulations, we created a slr1649-loss-of-function strain of Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803 and complemented this strain with the nucleomorph-encoded orf.
The generated Slr1649 loss-of-function mutant generally
has characteristics conductive with the description by
Shen et al. for a cpcT knock-out in Synechococcus sp. PCC
7002 [10]. Nevertheless, additional effects in the slr1649
knock-out mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were
identified in respect to linker proteins within the phycobilisomes of the mutant. Complementation of slr1649 with
the nucleomorph-specific orf222 indicated that the cryptophytic protein, although having originated from an
organism using phycoerythrin as accessory pigment,
attaches a bilin to the position Cys-β155 of phycocyanin
in the cyanobacterium.

Results
In silico analyses
After analyzing the nucleomorph genome of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta, we identified an open reading
frame (orf222) with a high degree of similarity to cyanobacterial genes (Table 1), that encode soluble proteins
possessing a DUF1001 domain. Alignments of the cryptophyte sequence with these cyanobacterial sequences indicated that orf222 should encode an additional transit
peptide as shown by a N-terminal extension. Further orfs
with homology to orf222 and the cyanobacterial
homologs are additionally present in the nuclear genome
of red alga [24]. In higher plants, i.e. Arabidopsis thaliana,
orfs with some similarity are also present [25]. Even the

Cyanobacterial and eukaryotic homologous of Orf222 were obtained by blast search analysis of the NCBI database, as well as the JGI and Cyanobase.
The (-) indicates that no adjacent genes in the same orientation were detectable. Orf222 homologous genes are in bold. PBP = phycobiliproteins (except
of allophycocyanin), PC = phycocyanin, PE = phycoerythrin, PEC phycoerythrocyanin.

bacteriophage S-PM2, which infects Synechococcus strains,
encodes a homolog of orf222 [26] (Table 1).
The number of Orf222 homologues in cyanobacteria varies in several species and does not correlate with the
number of phycobiliproteins. Nevertheless, there is a
strong tendency to express more than one species of
Orf222 homolog in organisms containing multiple types
of phycobiliproteins in the rods (Table 1). Based on
amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic networks, four monophyletic groups can therefore been
assigned (Fig. 1). Two of them resemble CpeT-like proteins (phycoerythrin operon protein); the other two
groups harbor members of Slr1649-like type. Neither the
Guillardia theta sequence nor any other eukaryotic
sequences can be assigned to any one of the four monophyletic groups.
Additionally, clear affiliations of the Gloeobacter violaceus
PCC 7421 (glr1182) and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002
(CpcT) sequences can not be extrapolated. With the exeption of the Prochlorococcus species, at least one member of
the Slr1649-like group is present in all cyanobacteria
investigated to date. CpeT-like proteins were only detected
in cyanobacteria encoding phycoerythrin and/or phycoerythrocyanin. Although the proteins of both groups seem
to have the same function, further investigations on the
corresponding genes relevant in the genomic context
revealed a noticeable difference. Unlike the genes of the
cpeT-group, the slr1649-group is by far less conserved in its
genomic localization (Table 1). Except for Nostoc sp. PCC
7120, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 and Trichodesmium
erythraeum IMS 101, the localization of the homolog gene
is always downstream of cpeS. In few cases it is followed
by cpeR. On the other hand, genes for the slr1649-group
are rather randomly distributed in the investigated cyanobacterial genomes (Table 1).

Generation of a slr1649 knock-out strain
We used Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a model organism
and created first a slr1649 knockout strain (Δslr1649) by
inserting a kanamycin resistance cassette into the slr1649
open reading frame via homologous recombination. The
generated homozygous knock-out mutant showes identical features described in Shen et al. [10]. Just like the characterized cpcT mutant in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, our
knock-out mutant contains a decreased level of phycocyanin up to 60% and a resulting pale green phenotype. The
knock-out cells produce smaller phycobilisomes, which
could be the cause of their different migration behaviour
in sucrose density gradients in comparison to wild type
phycobilisomes. Furthermore, isolated phycobilisomes
showed a red-shifted absorbance maxima and a slightly
smaller apparent molecular mass in the β-subunit of phycocyanin on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). After the digestion of purified phycocyanin with formic acid and a
phycocyanobilin addition assay, Shen et al. concluded
after digestion that the cpcT gene from Synechocccus sp.
PCC 7002 encodes a bilin lyase responsible for the attachment of phycocyanobilin to Cys-153 on the β-subunit of
phycocyanin [10]. The same is most likely true for the Synechocystis homolog Slr1649 due to the high homology and
the similar phenotype between the two knock-out
mutants. Thus, Slr1649 is thought to attach a bilin group
to the homolog position Cys-155 of β-phycocyanin in
Synechocystis sp.PCC 6803.
Isolation and analysis of phycobilisomes
By isolating and analysing phycobilisomes from our
knock-out mutant, we observed one additional feature
besides the one already known from the characterization
of the Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 homolog. As shown in
Fig. 2A two linker polypeptides, CpcC2 and CpcD,
encoded by the genes cpcC2 and cpcD respectively, are
missing in the isolated phycobilisomes of the mutant but
could be identified in the wild type during mass spectrometry analysis. The other linker polypeptides CpcC1

The initial alignment contained 307 sites including 191 gapped sites that were excluded from the analysis, leaving 116 amino acid sites for log determinant (LogDet) distance estimates with removal of invariant sites using the program LDDist. From this a Neighbor – net splits
graph was constructed, which is visualized with Splitstree4. Highlighted are four monophyletic groups: Two of them resemble
CpeT-like (phycoerythrin operon protein) proteins (highlighted in green) and two groups harbor members of the Slr1649-like
type (highlighted in red). Not shown: The sequences of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 Synpcc7942_0800 and Synechococcus

and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301 Syc0764_d and the sequences of Prochlorococcus marinus SS120 Pro0342 and Prochlorococcus marinus CCMP1375 orf195.

(cpcC1), CpcG1 (cpcG1), ApcC (apcC) and ApcE (apcE) are
present in both strains.
Upon further investigations, the absence of the linker proteins was proven not to be a transcriptional effect. In
exemplarily reverse transcription experiments for cpcC2,
the presence of identical cpcC2 transcripts was confirmed
in both the mutant and the wild type strain by sequencing
the obtained RT-PCR products (data not shown).
Complementation
In order to investigate if the nucleomorph-specific reading
frame orf222 from the cryptophyte Guillardia theta is able
complement the effects of the slr1649 loss-of-function, we
integrated this potential gene without its putative transit
peptide into the cyanobacterial genome of Synechocystis
sp. PCC 6803. This simultaneously affected the reading
frame of slr1649 and its cis-acting upstream signals (Fig.

3A). In the complemented strain, slr1649 is separated
from its natural upstream region, generating a promoterless truncated gene, in which the translational initiator
codon and the next two codons are no longer present in
the reading frame. The loss of the slr1649 gene product
and the complete segregation of the mutation were shown
by immunoblot experiments using polyclonal antibodies
generated against Slr1649 (Fig. 3B). Here, cross-reactions
of the antibody were shown to be present in the wild type
but not in the mutant strain extract. Additional analysis of
the complemented strain by RT-PCR and sequence analysis showed that the integrated cryptophytic orf222 is transcribed (data not shown).
Characterization of the complemented strain
Interestingly the phenotype of the complemented strain is
similar to that of the wild type strain, as indicated by the
greenish color of the culture (data not shown). During

sucrose density-gradient separation of isolated phycobilisomes from the complemented strain, we noticed no difference in the migration behaviour of the prominent band
in respect to the wild type strain in contrast to the migration behaviour of the knock-out mutant (Fig. 4). This
indicates that the size of the phycobilisomes is identical in
both strains and could indeed be confirmed by a proteome and mass spectrometry analysis. Here we showed
that the missing linker proteins of the slr1649 knock-out
strain were present in the complemented strain (Fig. 2A).
Additionally, there was no molecular mass shift in the βsubunit of phycocyanin of the complemented strain on
SDS-PAGE visible. Further analyses revealed that the
chromophore group, missing at positions Cys-β153 and
Cys-β155 in the knock-out mutants of Synechococcus sp.
PCC 7002 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 respectively,
most probably reappeared in the complemented strain,
because Zn2+ stainings of phycobilisomes separated by

(Fig. 2B).

fraction of Δslr1649 cells nor in the fraction of the complemented strain were signals of the Slr1649 antibody detectable. Specific polyclonal Slr1470 antibodies were used as a
loading control and clear signasl at the expected size were
obtained in all three protein fractions.
To clarify this we digested isolated phycobiliproteins with
formic acid. In doing so, CpcB is cleaved at a single site
while all other phycobiliproteins remain unaffected. The
expected sizes for fluorescent fragments are 15.36 kDa
with a chromophore group at position Cys-β84 and 2.78
kDa for the fragment with the chromophore group at
position Cys-β155. As shown in Figure 5, these expected
fragments were obtained. In addition to a signal at 15.36
kDa, a signal at 2.78 kDa was detected in the lane containing wild type strain protein and protein from the complemented strain but not in the one containing Δslr1649
protein. These data confirmed that the chromophore
group, missing in the knock-out mutant, is present in the
complementation. This together with the identification of

Cryptophytes are important organisms for several reasons. In terms of cell biology, their complex compartmentalization is of major interest, because several plasmas and
genomes coexist in these organisms, which can be traced
back to either a prokaryote or a eukaryote [27]. One of the
hallmarks of cryptophytes is the remnant of a second
nucleus, which originated by the reduction of the cell
nucleus of an engulfed phototrophic eukaryote by

another eukaryotic cell [28]. This compartment, the
nucleomorph, is minimized in its coding capacity and
expresses – in the case of Guillardia theta – only approximately a tenth of that of the E. coli K12 genome [29]. The
reduced coding capacity leads to the impression that the
genes are still present in the nucleomorph may encode
important functions. Thus, we are interested in addressing
the functions of proteins encoded by the nucleomorph.
However, due to the lack of a method of transfecting cryptophytes, we are studying homologs of the nucleomorph
genes and their encoded proteins in genetically accessible
organisms in order to identify the functions of the cryptophytic proteins indirectly. One of the best-studied and
genetically accessible cyanobacterium is Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803.

resulting fragment after Zn2+ stain at 2.78 kDa. There are
also several signals at 17–20 kDa which refer to the unaffected α-subunit of phycocyanin and the α- and β-subunit of
allophycocyanin.

Orf222 is one of the uncharacterized nucleomorph-specific open reading frames, for which homologs are present
in many cyanobacteria. Analysis of the contribution of
this gene within different organisms indicated that a clear
correlation between orf222-homolog genes and phycobiliproteins is present, because at least one orf222
homolog is encoded in all organisms expressing phycobiliproteins, including red alga. Phylogenetic studies
demonstrated that homologs of the orf222 gene can be
classified into the following four groups (Fig. 1): Slr1649like a, Slr1649-like b, CpeT-like a and CpeT-like b.
Because the method for network construction as well as
sampling in our studies is different from that of a recently
presented phylogeny [10], it is not surprising that slightly
different affiliations are resolved. However, our network

Page 7 of 12

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:56

corrects erroneous affiliations and indicates uncertainties
of the basal grouping. This may be seen in the position of
the bacteriophage sequence, which is in the network presented here in the neighbourhood of the bacteria they
infect and not in the same branch as the cryptophyte
sequence.
Despite the high degree of homology, the members of
Slr1649-like and CpeT-like groups differ in the genomic
context of the corresponding genes (Table 1). Members of
the CpeT group are predominantly localized in the phycoerythrin associated linker protein operon [30,31] next to
the cpeS gene. In some cases, even the cpeR gene is localized directly downstream of cpeT. Because operon structures connect functionally related genes in many cases,
CpeT could be an either structurally or functionally moiety of the phycobilisome and it has been shown to be
responsible for the attachment of a bilin group to a specific site from β-phycocyanin [10]. It is remarkable that a
congruent distribution of members of the Slr1649-groups
is not visible, because the genes seem to be localized randomly throughout different genomes. Interestingly,
slr1649-homologs exist in some higher plants such as
Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana (Fig. 1). The encoded
proteins of these land plants are characterized by a
DUF1001 domain as well, but obviously have paralogous
functions, since the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog seems to
be required for plastid division [25]. It is also suggested to
play an important role in cell differentiation and the regulation of the cell division plane in plants [25]. The same
could be true for the copy of the bacteriophage S-PM2, but
seems to be unlikely since this phage infects different Synechococcus strains and its resource of the homolog may be
the result of a selective advantage.
The homozygous knock-out mutant Δslr1649 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 showed features identical to a cpcT
knock-out mutant from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002
described in Shen et al. [10]. Here, the same pale green
phenotype and a reduced phycocyanin content, resulting
from a missing bilin group in phycobilisomes, was created by knock-out of cpcT, homolog to slr1649 homolog
in this cyanobacterium. This indicates that the lyase function of the homologous proteins of Synechococcus sp. PCC
7002 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is comparable.
Nevertheless, we obtained one additional, not described
feature in the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 knock-out
mutant. Two linker proteins, CpcC2 and CpcD, were
missing from the phycobilisomes in the knock-out
mutant Δslr1649. CpcD is a small linker (10 kDa) located
at the distal tip of rods, possibly functioning as a rod terminating factor [32]. The CpcC2 rod linker (30 kDa) connects the most distal located phycocyanin discs [33]. Both
genes are located in the phycocyanin operon from which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/56

they are co-transcribed with the phycocyanin subunits
and the cpcC1 linker gene [33]. A transcriptional effect
causing the loss of the linker proteins appears to be very
unlikely, because the α-subunit, the β-subunit and CpcC1
linker are present, although the CpcD and the CpcC2
linker are simultaneously absent. This is indicative of our
finding that the cpcC2 gene is indeed transcribed in the
mutant as indicated by reverse transcription experiments
(data not shown). Therefore, the deficit of the two linker
proteins in mutant phycobilisomes is a post-transcriptional effect. However, we can not rule out that a
decreased stability of phycobilisomes caused by the
altered β-phycocyanin may be the reason for the lack of
the two linker proteins in our preparations. In any case,
the lack of the linker proteins is a molecular marker for the
loss of lyase function, which may be interested to be studied in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 [10] as well.
Guillardia theta, the cryptophyte on which we are primarily focusing expresses a homolog of slr1649 in association with phycoerythrin. Phycobiliproteins are located in
the thylakoid lumen and apparently not organized in phycobilisomes in cryptophytes. Because the cryptophyte
Guillardia theta uses phycoerythrin and not phycocyanin
as an accessory pigment for photosynthesis, one might
not expect that the putative cryptophytic lyase is able to
complement the one of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Surprisingly, the complemented strain showed wild type phycobilisomes structures as shown by the correct attachment
of chromophore groups and the linker protein spectrum.
Thus, Orf222 from the cryptophyte is able to complement
the loss-of-function of Slr1649, indicating that the cryptophytic phycoerythrin lyase has still retained the capacity
to couple a bilin group to β-phycocyanin, even after the
progenitor of both classes of proteins evolved into apparently paralogous ones. However, a pleiotropic function of
a biliprotein lyase with a specificity for phycobilin:cysteine-84 was recently shown in vitro for CpeS1 from
Anabaena PCC 7120 [11], implicating that a multiplicity
of proteins like the cryptophytic phycobilin:cysteine-β155
lyase has the capacity to couple bilins to homologous
positions in a variety of phycobiliproteins.

Conclusion
Loss-of function of a bilin lyase leads to a variety of effects
in phycobilisome structure. This is already shown for a
cpcT mutant in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and could be
confirmed by the generation of a slr1649 knock-out
mutant in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, homolog cpcT. One
additional feature, the lack of two distal linker proteins,
fits with the already known altered phycobilisome structure and may be the reason for the decreased phycocyanin
content in mutant missing the bilin lyase.

Loss of Slr1649 was complemented in vivo by the
homolog Orf222, which is encoded by the tiny vestigial
nucleus of the eukaryotic endosymbiont from the cryptophyte Guillardia theta. Thus, Orf222 is supposed to be a
phycoerythrin-bilin lyase in cryptophytes. Despite having
originated from an organism using phycoerythrin as its
accessory pigment, the protein still has the capacity to
couple a chromophore group to the β-subunit of phycocyanin, indicating the functional universality of bilin lyases
on the one hand and demonstrating the importance of
nucleomorph-encoded cellular functions on the other.

Methods
Cell Culture
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains, wild type, Δslr1649 and
the complemented strain, were grown at 30°C in Erlenmeyer flasks containing BG-11 media [34] with gentle
swirling under standard light conditions (70 μE) and
atmospheric CO2 levels. For growth on plates, BG-11
medium was supplemented with 1% Agar. Plates were
incubated under the same conditions as liquid cultures.
Construction of the Δslr1649 Mutant
Two pairs of primers were used to amplify the flanking
regions of the knock-out construct: 1649a_f (5'-GGT TAC
TGC TCG AGG CGC ATC A-3') and 1649a_r (5'-GGA
CGG CAA GGG ATC CTA TCT GG-3') generate fragment
slr1649a, 1649b_f (5'-GGA CGG CAA GGG ATC CTA TCT
GG-3') and 1649b_r (5'-CAG AAA TTG CCG CGG CCA
ATC TC-3') fragment 1649b. Both were ligated into the
pGEM-T vector (Promega, Mannheim) and after verification of the sequence, transferred into the pBluescript II SK
(Stratagene, Amsterdam) vector. Escherichia coli strain
MRF' XL-1 blue was used as plasmid host for cloning
steps.

Using the BamHI restriction site (inserted by the primer
1649a-r and 1649b_f), a kanamycin resistance gene was
cloned between the two fragments resulting in plasmid
pΔ1649. After transforming into wild type Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803 cells with this plasmid, transformants were
selected on BG-11 agar plates supplemented with kanamycin (5 μg/ml starting concentration). Kanamycin
resistant clones were transferred to BG-11 liquid media. A
homozygous culture was achieved by increasing kanamycin concentrations (50 μg/ml final concentration). Complete knock-out was confirmed via Southern blot analysis.
Construction of the Complemented Strain
Nucleotide sequence of orf222 was amplified from Guillardia theta DNA without its putative transit peptide by
using the primers 222komp2_f (5'-CAT ATG AAT TAA
AAC CAA TCC TTA ATT G -3') and 222komp_r (5'-GTT
AAA ATT AAA TGA ATT CTA ATA A-3'). Two pairs of primers were used to amplify the flanking regions: 1649a_f (5'-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/56

GGT TAC TGC TCG AGG CGC ATC A-3') and
1649kompa1_r (5'-CAA TAA CTA CAT ATG TCC CAT
TCC-3') generated the fragment Compa, which includes
the upstream region for slr1649, 1649kompa2_f (5'-TTT
ATG TCG AAT TCC ACT GAT C-3') and 1649b_r (5'- GAG
ATT GGC CGC GGC AAT TTC TG-3') generated fragment
Compb. All three fragments were ligated into the pGEM-T
vector (Promega, Mannheim) and after verification of the
sequence, transferred into the pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, Amsterdam) vector using different restrictions sides
inserted by the primers leading to a precursor construct.
By using EcoRI restriction sites, a spectinomycin cassette
was cloned between the two fragments Compa/orf222
and Compb resulting in plasmid pComp222 Δslr1649.
After transforming the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 wild
type strain with this plasmid, transformants were selected
on BG-11 agar plates supplemented with spectinomycin
(5 μg/ml starting concentration). Spectinomycin resistant
clones were transferred to BG-11 liquid media. A
homozygous culture was achieved by increasing spectinomycin concentrations (30 μg/ml final concentration).
Nucleic Acid Analysis
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were collected by centrifugation of 5 ml cell culture at 3200 × g. For DNA isolation, the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl TE buffer pH
7.0. After addition of breaking buffer (10% sodium
dodecyl sulfat (w/v), 5% sodium lauryl sulfat (w/v)), 200
μl glass beads (0.2 mm diameter) and 400 μl phenol, cells
were lysed by vortexing the suspension three times for 10
s. The suspension was then centrifuged at 12 000 × g and
the resulting upper phase transferred to a new cup. This
sample was treated twice with phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) and centrifuged as before. By adding 1/10 Vol. NaAc pH 4.8 and two Vol. 96% ethanol, the
DNA was precipitated for 1 h at -20°C. Afterwards, an
additional washing step with 70% ethanol was performed. The pellet was dried and resuspended in H2O.

RNA was isolated from Synechocystis cells with Trizol© (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe) according to the manufacturer protocol. Northern Blot and Southern Blot analysis were
performed according to standard protocols (Sambrook).
Probes were constructed using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche, Mannheim).
Antibody Generation and Purification
To generate an antibody against Slr1649 we used the
primers ex1649_f (5'-GGA TCC TTA TGT CCC ATT CCA
CTG-3') and ex1649_r (5'-CTC GAG GCT GGC TAA AAA
CTA ACT-3') to amplify the slr1649 gene, which was
finally cloned in the pGEX-5X-3 vector (GE Healthcare
Biosciences). After overexpression and purification of the
Slr1649 GST fusion protein, immunization steps were
executed by the Eurogentec company (Seraing).

The IgG fraction was purified from serum by protein A
sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Biosciences).
Isolation of Phycobilisomes
Phycobilisome isolation was performed according to Gray
et al. [35]. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000
rpm for 10 min at room temperature. After an additional
washing step with BG-11 media, cells were resuspended in
0.75 M potassium-phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (PPB), containing a protease inhibitors cocktail (PIC, 2 mg/ml
Antipain, 5 mg/ml Chymostatin, 2 mg/ml Aprotinin, 5
mg/ml Trypsin-Inhibitor, 2 mg/ml Pepstatin, 5 mg/ml
Leupeptin, 1 mg/ml Elastatinal and 2 mg/ml Na2EDTA in
HEPES/KOH. Final concentration 200 μg/ml Inhibitor)
and afterwards broken by two passes through a French
press (Aminco) at 124 MPa. The lysates were incubated
with Triton X-100 (2%) for 15 min at room temperature
and subsequently centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 1 h to pellet unbroken cells and membrane debris. The supernatant
was immediately loaded on a 10%–40% linear sucrose
gradient, solved in PPB and centrifuged at 18 000 rpm for
16 h at 15°C.
SDS-PAGE
Standard SDS-PAGE was performed with an Hoefer SE
250 apparatus (83 mm × 101 mm, 0,75 mm thick) or a
custom made system (250 mm × 150 mm and 1,0 mm
thick) using the Laemmli buffer system [36]. The polyacrylamide content in the separating gel was a gradient of
10% to 15%. The stacking gel contained 6% polyacrylamide. To achieve a better resolution of polypeptides with
masses less than 15 kDa, the SDS-Tricine gel system was
used [37]. Staining of gels was generally carried out with
Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 dissolved in solution A
(2% phosphoric acid v/v, 10% (NH4)2SO4 w/v) and
methanol (40:9:1). To visualize the bilin carrying proteins
gels were incubated in a 0.2 M ZnSO4 solution [38,39]
and highlighted with UV in a transilluminator (Bio-Rad).
Formic Acid Cleavage
Phycobilisomes were precipitated with Methanol/Chloroform [40] and resuspended in cleavage buffer. Cleavage
was done according to Piszkiewicz et al. [41]. 30 μg of
phycobilisomes were incubated for 16 h at 37°C with
70% formic acid in before adding SDS sample buffer and
analysis by Tricine SDS-PAGE on a 17% polyacrylamide
gel.
Isolation of Protein Extracts from Synechocystis sp. PCC
6803
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were grown and harvested
as described above. The cell pellet was resuspended in
TEN100 buffer [42], containing PIC. Cell lysis was performed as described above.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/56

MALDI-TOF MS Analysis
The protein spots were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion before mass spectrometry analysis as described previously [43]. The peptide mixtures from the tryptic digests
were desalted and concentrated using ZipTips™ columns
made from the reverse chromatography resins Poros and
Oligo R3 (Applied Biosystems). The bound peptides were
washed with a solution of 0.5% formic acid and eluted
from the column in 1 μl of 33% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid solution saturated with α-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic (Bruker Daltonics) directly onto a
MALDI target plate and air dried before analysis in the
mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry measurement was
performed on an Ultraflex-TOF TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Peptide mass fingerprint
spectra were acquired in the reflectron positive mode with
a pulsed extraction using approximately 100 laser shots.
The spectra were acquired after an external calibration
using reference peptides (Peptide mixture II Bruker Daltonics). The acquired spectra were further internally calibrated using trypsin autolysis peaks as internal standards
(842.5100, 2211.1046 Da). Monoisotopic masses were
assigned and processed using Biotools ™ and FlexAnalysis
™ software (Bruker Daltonics) before submitting them to
the Mascot program [44] for searches against the nonredundant NCBI database. The parameters used in the
Mascot peptide mass fingerprint searches were as follows:
Taxonomy, Synechocystis; search all molecular masses and
all isoelectric points; allow up to one missed proteolytic
cleavage site and a peptide mass tolerance of 50 ppm.
Methionine oxidation was considered as an optional
modification and cysteine carbamidomethylation as a
fixed modification in all the searches. Matches to Synechocystis proteins were considered unambiguous when the
probability score was significant using the Mascot score
with a p value < 0.05 and when there was a minimum of
five peptides and with a sequence coverage greater than
20%. For each protein the identity was further validated
by tandem MS-MS analysis of selected peptides.
In silico Analysis
Blast search analyses were done by NCBI protein-protein
blast [45] (see Additional file 1). This program was also
used for conserved domain predictions. Transmembrane
domains were predicted by using TMHMM server v. 2.0
[46] and the SOSUI protein prediction server [47].
Genome data from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were
obtained from CyanoBase [48]. In silico cleavage was performed by PeptideMass [49].
Network Construction
The 41 sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [50] with
16 iterations. The output format was set to the standard
ClustalW format [51]. The alignment contained 307 sites
including 191 gapped sites that were excluded from the

analysis. From the remaining 116 sites logdet distances
were estimated using LDDist 1.3.2 [52]. These distances
were used to construct a Neighbor-net splits graph [53]
that was visualized with SplitsTree4 [54].
