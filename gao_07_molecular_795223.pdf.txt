Abstract
Background: Species of the Drosophila obscura species group (e.g., D. pseudoobscura, D. subobscura)
have served as favorable models in evolutionary studies since the 1930's. Despite numbers of
studies conducted with varied types of data, the basal phylogeny in this group is still controversial,
presumably owing to not only the hypothetical 'rapid radiation' history of this group, but also
limited taxon sampling from the Old World (esp. the Oriental and Afrotropical regions). Here we
reconstruct the phylogeny of this group by using sequence data from 6 loci of 21 species (including
16 Old World ones) covering all the 6 subgroups of this group, estimate the divergence times
among lineages, and statistically test the 'rapid radiation' hypothesis.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses indicate that each of the subobscura, sinobscura, affinis, and
pseudoobscura subgroups is monophyletic. The subobscura and microlabis subgroups form the basal
clade in the obscura group. Partial species of the obscura subgroup (the D. ambigua/D. obscura/D.
tristis triad plus the D. subsilvestris/D. dianensis pair) forms a monophyletic group which appears to
be most closely related to the sinobscura subgroup. The remaining basal relationships in the obscura
group are not resolved by the present study. Divergence times on a ML tree based on mtDNA data
are estimated with a calibration of 30–35 Mya for the divergence between the obscura and
melanogaster groups. The result suggests that at least half of the current major lineages of the
obscura group originated by the mid-Miocene time (~15 Mya), a time of the last developing and
fragmentation of the temperate forest in North Hemisphere.
Conclusion: The obscura group began to diversify rapidly before invading into the New World.
The subobscura and microlabis subgroups form the basal clade in this group. The obscura subgroup
is paraphyletic. Partial members of this subgroup (D. ambigua, D. obscura, D. tristis, D. subsilvestris,
and D. dianensis) form a monophyletic group which appears to be most closely related to the
sinobscura subgroup.

Background
Species of the Drosophila obscura group (41 species
assigned to six subgroups) are mostly inhabitants of temperate forest throughout the Holarctic region, with some
can adapted into high-elevation temperate-like habitats in
the Afrotropical, Neotropical and Oriental regions. Some
of these species (e.g., D. pseudoobscura and its close relatives) have served as favorable models for evolutionary
biology since the influential works of Dobzhansky and his
colleagues in the 1930's [1,2]. The whole-genome
sequence of D. pseudoobscura was determined following D.
melanogaster. Comparisons between the two species have
shed new light on Drosophila genome evolution [3]. In
addition, in the past two decades, increasing number of
evolutionary studies have been conducted in a historical
background of the obscura species group on varied subjects, e.g., evolution of genome size [4], evolution of karyotype and P elements [5], origin and evolution of
Drosophila Y chromosome [6] and genetics of morphological evolution [7].
Since the 1950's, a number of studies have been conducted to reconstruct phylogeny of the obscura group via a
variety of approaches [2,8]. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies [9-13] clearly support the monophyly of the
obscura species group and recover several well-supported
lineages, for example, the affinis, pseudoobscura, and subobscura subgroups, the D. ambigua triad (D. obscura, D.
ambigua and D. tristis), give essential support to the monophyletic origin of the New World species, i.e., those of the
affinis and pseudoobscura subgroups. In spite of this, the
relationship among the Old World obscura, subobscura,
microlabis, and sinobscura subgroups, and their relationship to the New World clade are still poorly resolved. This
phylogenetic predicament was partially ascribed to the
"rapid radiation" history of the obscura group [10,12]. An
alternative hypothesis to explain the lack of resolution at
the base of this phylogeny is a bias in taxon sampling. For
example, none of the previous phylogenetic studies has
dealt with the obscura group as a whole: different studies
employed different set of taxa, with species from the Afrotropical region (5 species) and Oriental region (8
described + 2 undescribed species) have rarely been investigated [14,15], probably due to the difficulty in collecting
and/or culturing these poorly known taxa.
In the present study, nucleotide sequences (henceforth
referred to as NT) from six loci (Table 1) of 21 D. obscura
group species and 2 D. melanogaster group species (Table
2) are used to reconstruct the phylogeny of the obscura
species group. Phylogenetic analyses are also performed
based on translated amino acid sequences (henceforth
referred to as AA). We then estimate the divergence times
in the obscura group, and statistically test the previously

Results
Summary of the DNA sequences
The alignment of the six gene regions spanned 4,126
nucleotide or 1,149 amino acid positions (Table 1). Table
3 gives accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences,
either cited from GenBank [9-11,13,15-28] or newly
determined for this study.

A plot of nucleotide substitution saturation is shown in
Figure 1. For the mitochondrial sequences, the transition/
transversion (ti/tv) ratio in 1st+2nd codon positions (Figure 1A) ranges from 13.50 (D. ambigua vs. D. obscura) to
1.313 (D. dianensis vs. D. guanche), with the average of
2.70; and the ratio in the 3rd codon position (Figure 1B)
ranges from 6.750 (D. pseudoobscura vs. D. miranda) to
0.581 (D. affinis vs. D. madeirensis), with the average of
1.08. This suggests strong saturation in the 3rd codon
positions between distantly related species. For the Adh
gene, the ti/tv ratio in 1st+2nd codon positions (Figure
1C) ranges from 3.00 (e.g., D. ambigua vs. D. guanche) to
0.00 (D. miranda vs. D. persimilis); the ratio in the 3rd
codon positions ranges from 4.50 (D. limingi vs. D. tsukubaensis) to 0.429 (D. obscura vs. D. affinis/D. limingi).
Slight decrease of ti/tv is found in the 3rd codon positions
with increase of pairwise distance.
Pairwise partition homogeneity test (PHT)
Table 4 shows the results of pairwise PHT between NT partitions. On a threshold of P = 0.05 [29], incongruences are
found in 4 out of 15 pairwise tests (ND2 vs. COI, ND2 vs.
Adh, COI vs. COII, and COI vs. Adh) with un-weighted
parsimony scheme. Compared to this, when a six-parameter weighting scheme (see below for details) was imple-

mented, the P values for most pairwise comparisons
increased greatly.
Incongruence between data partitions indicates that the
two partitions compared have had different histories or
that one of them violate the assumptions of the phylogenetic method [29]. The PHT is currently implemented
with only parsimony, which assuming small number of
actual sequence changes per site. Higher P values obtained
by six-parameter weighting may indicates that, the sixparameter parsimony method fits the NT data better by
accounting for the effect of multiple hits (as suggested in
the saturation plot in Figure 1), thus reduces the incongruence in several pairwise comparisons.
Phylogenetic analyses with NT data
Results of analyses with NT data using the maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian

inference (BI) methods are shown in Figure 2. These analyses lend strong support to the monophyly of the obscura
group, recover the same set of major lineages in this
group, including the affinis, pseudoobscura, subobscura and
sinobscura subgroups, the D. ambigua triad (D. ambigua, D.
obscura and D. tristis), and the D. dianensis/D. subsilvestris,
D. bifasciata/D. imaii and D. limingi/D. tsukubaensis lineages, each supported with high bootstrap value (BP) or
posterior probability (PP). All the trees strongly support
the sister relationship between the affinis and pseudoobscura subgroups (BP = 94–97; PP = 1.00). They completely
agree with each other with respect to relationship within
each of the major lineages. The branching orders within
the pseudoobscura and subobscura subgroups are largely
consistent with those of previous studies. The order
within the sinobscura subgroup is also suggested by data of
morphology [30] or interspecific reproductive isolation
(Gao et al., unpublished data).
The MP tree deduced with the un-weighted method (Figures 2A; henceforth referred to as uwMP tree) clusters the
D. ambigua triad with the sinobscura subgroup, while puts
the D. dianensis/D. subsilvestris pair outside this cluster.
However, the MP tree deduced with the six-parameter
weighting method (Figure 2B; henceforth referred to as
6pMP tree), the ML tree (Figure 2C) and the Bayesian tree
(Figure 2D) congruously suggest a cluster of the D.
ambigua triad and the D. dianensis/D. subsilvestris pair. This
cluster (henceforth referred to as obscura cluster) forms a
larger cluster with the sinobscura subgroup (henceforth
referred to as obscura-sinobscura cluster). However, the supports for these relationships are also low.
D. microlabis, as the single representative of the microlabis
subgroup, is placed at the basal position in the uwMP and
6pMP trees. However, this species is clustered with the
subobscura subgroup in the ML tree (Figure 2C, BP = 93)
and Bayesian tree (Figure 2D; PP = 1.00). The uwMP,
6pMP and Bayesian trees suggest weakly (BP = 6–39; PP =
0.81) a close relationship between the obscura-sinobscura
cluster and the New World clade. However, the ML tree
clusters all the Old World species into a large group with
weak support (BP = 28).
Phylogenetic analyses with AA data set
Figure 3 shows the results of phylogenetic analyses with
AA data, including the strict consensus of 17 equally parsimonious MP trees (Figure 3A) and the Bayesian trees
inferred with the Poisson model (Figure 3B) or the GTR
(General time reversible) model (Figure 3C). All these
trees recover the same set of major lineages as those trees
of NT data, clearly indicating that the microlabis and subobscura subgroups are basal to the remainder ingroup species (BP = 53; PP = 0.96–0.99), all of which form a very
large monophyletic group. The Bayesian analyses strongly

indicate that D. microlabis forms a monophyletic group
with the subobscura subgroup (PP = 0.99). All the analyses
with AA data lend strong support to the monophyly of the
obscura cluster (BP = 87; PP = 1.00), while the obscurasinobscura cluster is only weakly suggested by the Bayesian
tree inferred with the Poisson model.
The Bayesian trees of AA data recover the same relationships within each of the major lineages as those of the NT
data, except for that they suggest a branching order of
(ambigua, (obscura, tristis)) in the D. ambigua triad, and
that the tree inferred with the Poisson model clusters the
Kunming (KM) strain of D. hubeiensis with D. sinobscura,
instead of its conspecific Hubei (HB) strain. However, all
these relationships are very weakly supported.
Divergence times in the obscura species group
The divergence times are estimated on a given tree – a ML
tree constructed with the concatenated mitochondrial
sequences. This tree is selected as a representative phylogenetic hypothesis of the obscura group based on the foregoing results. The results of time estimation are shown as

a linearized form of the ML tree (Figure 4). In light of the
upper bound (35 Mya) of the calibration time interval for
the obscura-melanogaster divergence, the estimated time
span for the major radiation of the obscura group is ~14.9–
21.8 Mya, indicating that by the mid-Miocene time (~15
Mya), almost all the current major lineages of the obscura
group had come into being. Even in light of the calibration point of 30 Mya, at least half of the major lineages are
estimated to have originated by the mid-Miocene time.
The splitting between the D. ambigua triad and the D.
dianensis/D. subsilvestris pair (~14.9/12.9 Mya for upper/
lower bounds) falls close to the major radiation of the
obscura group, and the splitting between D. limingi and D.
tsukubaensis (~13.0/11.2 Mya) appears to be rather old.
The sinobscura subgroup began to diversify (~2.99/2.57
Mya) from about the mid-Pliocene time.
Our estimate for the origin of the microlabis-subobscura
clade (~19.5/16.7 Mya) falls close to previous estimation
based on mutation distance of 11 genes (17.7 ± 4.4 Mya;
D. pseudoobscura vs. D. subobscura) [31]; the estimate for
the splitting between the affinis-pseudoobscura clade and

the obscura-sinobscura cluster (~17.9/15.4 Mya) is clearly
older than the previous one based on Adh sequences (13.1
± 1.74 Mya; obscura subgroup vs. pseudoobscura subgroup)
[32], and the estimate for the D. pseudoobscura-D. miranda
divergence (4.93/3.76 Mya) differs greatly from the estimate based on mutation distances (2.00 ± 0.6 Mya) [31].
This is mainly due to that 1) our estimates is not directly
based on pairwise distances, but on a given tree with
branch lengths; 2) we use different calibration point from
those studies [31,32].

KITSCH tree; not shown) is constructed under an assumption of molecular clock, therefore all the terminal taxa on
this tree are shown as contemporaneous. The cumulative
frequency distribution (CFD) of the branching times
(after normalization) along this tree is plotted (Figure 5).
An "expected" CFD for 27-taxa trees is provided as contrast. This expected CFD, available from Wollenberg et al
[33], is the average of five hundred 27-taxa trees generated
by computer simulation under null model of stochastic
speciation/extinction. The comparison between the
empirical and average CFDs with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test [34] results a K-S D value of 0.4975. The P
value associated with this D value is very low (P < 0.0004,
significant), therefore rejected the null hypothesis [33],
indicating that the branching pattern in the KITSCH tree
differs from the expected stochastic timing of speciation/
extinction [33]. It is clearly seen that the CFD of the
KITSCH tree begins to deflect upwards from the average
CFD at a relative early stage of the branching process, suggesting an ancient cluster of branching events during the
evolutionary history of the obscura group.

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationship in the obscura group
Phylogeny of the obscura species group is investigated with
dense taxon-sampling from the Old World, especially the
Oriental region, using both nucleotide and translated
amino acid sequences of multiple loci. The results corroborate some previously well-recognized relationships, and
shed some new light on the evolutionary history of the
obscura group, especially the relationship among major
lineages.

The MP trees of NT data suggest with low confidence that
D. microlabis alone, as a long-branch taxon, represents the
first branch in the obscura group. However, it was strongly
suggested in the ML tree (Figure 2C) and Bayesian trees
(Figures 2D, 3B, and 3C) that D. microlabis forms a monophyletic group with the subobscura subgroup. A suspicion
arises whether the basal position of D. microlabis is true, or
an artifact due to long-branch attraction (LBA) by those
outgroups? As demonstrated by Anderson and Swofford
[35], if this relationship is true, MP method is prone to
positively recover it, thus seems to perform as good as, or
even better than ML method. Otherwise, ML will outperform MP by recovering the true relationship. As shown by
some studies with empirical data and/or computer simulation [35-37], model-based methods (ML and Bayesian
methods) can be relatively robust against branch-length
differences, even against model violation. Therefore, it is
very likely that the basal relationship of D. microlabis
alone in the MP trees is an artifact due to LBA, while the
ML and Bayesian trees suggest the true relationship
between the microlabis and subobscura subgroups.

and (C) are posterior probabilities. Symbols are same as in Figure 2.

The Bayesian trees with AA data (Figures 3B, 3C) support
with high confidences a basal position of the microlabissubobscura clade in the obscura group. This relationship is
also suggested by previous cladistic analyses [13]. In some
previous studies lacking any representative of the microlabis subgroup [10,12,38], the subobscura subgroup alone
was placed as basal to the rest in the obscura group. Moreover, comparison of more than 48 morphological characters among obscura group species (except for the microlabis
and sinobscura subgroups) suggests that D. subobscura (as
the only representative of the subobscura subgroup) differs
more from the other Eurasian species than the latter differ
from each other [39].

Consistent with some previous study [27], the present
study clusters the Palearctic D. helvetica with the Nearctic
D. affinis with strong support, clearly indicating its
adscription to the affinis subgroup. Morphologically, D.
helvetica possesses some diagnostic characters pertained to
the affinis subgroup, e.g., very small distal sex-comb, 6
rows of acrostichal setulae. Some morphological similarities between D. helvetica and D. tolteca, a member of the
affinis subgroup, are also found [40]. Given the Old World
Origin of the obscura group [42] and the monophyletic
nature of the affinis-pseudoobscura clade, D. helvetica
undoubtedly represents a refluence of the New World element back into the Old World.

The monophyly of the obscura cluster is also suggested by
morphological data: in the obscura group, D. dianensis, D.
subsilvestris and D. obscura are the only species characterized by pale spots on several abdominal tergites in female
[30,40], and large, somewhat quadrate 10th sternite in
male [30,41]. In the present study, the obscura cluster
appears to be most closely related to the sinobscura subgroup, while the remainder species of the obscura subgroup, i.e., the D. limingi/D. tsukubaensis pair and D.
bifasciata/D. imaii pair, appear to have diverged earlier.
Based on these evidences, we propose here a revised
notion of the obscura subgroup, i.e., the cluster of the five
species D. ambigua, D. obscura, D. tristis, D. dianensis and
D. subsilvestris.

It was demonstrated that Bayesian posterior probability
can overestimate the true probability of node confidences
if substitution model used for phylogenetic analysis is
oversimplified [43], and/or if concatenated sequences
data are used [44]. In the 6pMP and ML trees of NT data,
the BP supports for the obscura cluster are relatively low,
and so are the BP supports for the obscura-sinobscura cluster. However, the corresponding PP values in the Bayesian
tree of NT data seem to be excessively high. Also in the
analyses with AA data, a remarkable discrepancy between
BP and PP is found for the large clade consisting of the
affinis, pseudoobscura, sinobscura, and obscura subgroups. In
our Bayesian analysis with NT data, partition-specific
models are used. The Bayesian analyses of AA data with

simple (Poisson) and comprehensive (GTR) models yield
comparable PP supports for the above relationships.
Therefore, the great discrepancy between BP and PP may
be partially due to our using of concatenated sequences.
On the other hand, it was shown that BP in ML analyses is
generally a conservative estimate of statistical confidence
[44], and that compared to the BP in ML analyses, BP in
MP analyses shows lower correlation with Bayesian PP
[45].
The effect of taxon sampling on phylogenetic accuracy has
been addressed by a number of studies [46-49], most of
which favor addition of taxa, especially for breaking up
long branches to improve information about state of
internal nodes and rate at individual sites [47]. In the
present study, adding of a number of Old World taxa enables us to trace some additional, ancient branching events,
resulted in some largely congruent basal relationship in
the obscura group, e.g., the close relationship between the
D. ambigua triad and the D. dianensis/D. subsilvestris pair,
that between the obscura cluster and the sinobscura subgroup, and the sister relationship between the microlabis
and subobscura subgroups. The obscura group is presently
known for 41 described and at least 2 undescribed species.

trees of 27 obscura group species. The largest difference
between empirical and expected CFDs is indicated.

Future studies with denser taxon sampling and larger
number of characters (especially for nuclear gene
sequence characters) are desirable to fully resolve the
basal relationship in this group.
Temporal pattern of evolution
Throckmorton's [42] study with data of palegeography
and fossil record has proposed that the founder of the
obscura group arose and existed for short time before its
expanding with the temperate forest. The temperate forest
was proposed to began to spread in Northern Hemisphere
with decreasing of temperature by about 10~15°C in Oligocene [50]. However, according to our time estimation
(Figure 4), the Old World diversification of the obscura
group began well after the origin of this group. By the
mid-Miocene time, at least half of the current major lineages had come into being, indicating a more or less rapid
major radiation of the obscura group. This is also suggested
by the results of statistical test of temporal pattern (Figure
5), and reflected by the short internal branches in the phylogenetic trees (e.g., Figures 2C, 2D, 3B and 3C). On the
other hand, obvious nucleotide substitution saturation
(Figure 1) and base composition bias have been observed
in the mitochondrial loci. All these results lend supports
to the previous proposal [12] that either the rapid radiation, or the special evolutionary dynamics of the mtDNA
in the obscura group may account for the phylogenetic predicament concerning the obscura group.
Biogeography and history of adaptive radiation
Two major patterns during the evolution of the family
Drosophilidae have been proposed by Throckmorton
[42] based on morphological and biogeographical data:

Page 8 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:87

1) the primary tropical disjunction involving species
groups, subgenera and genera; and 2) the temperate-forest
disjunction involving species subgroups and species, represented typically by the obscura species group. Due to
lacking of data about drosophilid faunas from either the
Afrotropical or the Oriental region, the disjunction pattern of the obscura group within the Old World was
thought to be not clear [42]. However, the pattern is now
much more clearly seen: there are about 14 species (3 of
the subobscura subgroup, 4 of the microlabis subgroup, 1 of
the affinis subgroup, 5 of the obscura subgroup, and 1
ungrouped) are restricted to or mainly distributed in
Europe/the Afrotropical region; and at least 11 species (3
of the sinobscura subgroup, 6 of the obscura subgroup, and
2 undescribed) restricted to East/Southeast Asia. Among
the Eurasian species of the obscura group, at least 9 are
restricted or mainly distributed in the Oriental region,
with the southmost records from the Mt. Kinabalu of
Malaysia. This clearly indicates a thorough adaptation of
the group into high-elevation temperate-like habitats in
the Oriental region, a pattern parallel to those in the Afrotropical and Neotropical regions [8,51,52].
Our time estimation for the major radiation of the obscura
group is overlapped largely to the hypothetical time span
of the developing of temperate forest in Northern Hemisphere (mid-Oligocene to mid-Miocene) [50,53]. It was
proposed based on biogeographical data that, from the
mid-Tertiary times, the temperate drosophilid faunas
developed and spread with the temperate forest, until the
time of the temperate-forest disjunction in mid Miocene
age [42]. It is very likely that the fragmentation of the temperate forest had enforced the Old World diversification,
and that the gradual desertification of the Asia interior
onset from the early Miocene epoch [54] played important role in enforcing the disjunction of the temperate forest and thus the east-west disjunction of the obscura group
within the Old World.
The cooling of the climate in the Qinghai-Tibet area of
South Asia resulted from the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau in the Tertiary period was thought to provide favorable conditions for the Palearctic insect fauna to invade
southwards [55]. It is reasonable to presume that changing of climate might have also facilitated the adaptation of
the founders of the Oriental elements of the obscura group
into South Asia. Probably the intensified uplift of the plateau in late Pliocene [55] has accelerated these elements
(e.g., the sinobscura subgroup, initiated to diversify ~2.6–
3.0 Mya) to spread around, giving rise to the current species in south China, India and Malaysia.

before invaded into the New World. Among the Old
World lineages, the microlabis and subobscura subgroups
form a monophyletic group basal to the rest of the obscura
group. Our results corroborate the finding by the previous
studies that the traditional obscura group is paraphyletic,
with some of its members (the D. ambigua triad plus the
D. dianensis/D. subsilvestris pair) forming a monophyletic
cluster, which appears to be most closely related to the
sinobscura subgroup.

Methods
Samples, DNA extraction, PCR, cloning and sequencing
Samples of twenty-one species of the D. obscura group and
one species of the D. melanogaster group (Table 2) were
used for DNA sequencing. DNA was extracted from single
fly by standard phenol-chloroform method. The PCR
cycle program comprised an initial 2 min of predenaturation at 94°C, 35 cycles of amplification (50 s of denaturation at 94°C; 1 min of annealing at 55°C for ND2 and
COII, 51.5°C for Cyt b, 52°C for COI and Adh, 60°C for
28S; 1 min of extension at 72°C), and 5 min of sequence
postextension at 72°C. The primers (all given left to right
from 5' to 3' ends) for the PCR and sequencing of the
ND2, COI, COII, Cyt b and 28S genes were: nd2-1 ATATT
TACAG CTTTG AAGG, and nd2-2 AAGCT ACTGG GTTCA
TACC for the ND2 gene [56]; UEA5 AGTTC TAGCA
GGAGC TATTA CTAT, and UEA8 AAAAA TGTTG AGGGA
AAAAT GTTA for the COI gene [57]; coii-1 ATGGC AGATT
AGTGC AATGG and coii-2 GTTTA AGAGA CCAGT
ACTTG [13] for the COII gene; Cyt b-F TTATG GTTGA
TTATT ACGAA, and Cyt b-R CAAAA CATAT GCTTA TTCAA
for the Cyt b gene; 28S-H CCCGA AGTAT CCTGA ATCTT
TCGCA TTG (designed by T. Katoh in Hokkaido University), and 28S-T TCTTA GTAGC GGCGA GCG [58] for the
28S gene. PCR products were separated on 2.0% agarose
gels, then excised from the gels and purified using
Watson™ gel extraction mini kit (Watson Biotechnologies).

The Adh fragments of D. hubeiensis (KM), D. luguensis, D.
dianensis, and D. limingi were amplified using the primers
adh-e2+ CTGGAC TTCTG GGACA AGCG, and adh-e3TAGAT GCCCG AGTCC CAGTG [27], and the PCR product was cloned into the PMD18-T Vector (TaKaRa), then
transformed into Escherichia coli as host. Thereafter, the
recombinant DNA was extracted then, and the Adh fragment was sequenced with the M13 universal primers
AAGCT TGCAT GCCTG CAGGT CGACG and CGGTA
CCCGG GGATC CTCTA GAGAT. After purifying of the
product of sequence reaction, the sequences were determined using ABI 377 or ABI 3700 sequencer according to
the protocol by manufacturer.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our phylogenetic study suggests that, the
obscura group began to diversify rapidly in the Old World

Sequence aligning and characterization
The newly collected sequences were edited using the Editseq module of the DNAStar package [59]. For each of the
ND2, COI, COII, Cyt b, Adh and 28S gene fragment,
homologous GenBank sequences were downloaded and
aligned with newly determined sequences by the ClustalW method [60]. The intron region of the Adh gene was
excluded from all analyses. The alignment was then
adjusted by eye to make it conform to the codon assignments. Then the ends of a few COI and 28S sequences
were trimmed slightly, so as to make the majority of
homologous sequences well overlapped. We use MEGA3
[61] to calculate base composition and ti/tv ratios in each
data partitions. Detection of substitution saturation in
mitochondrial and nuclear data partitions was performed
by plotting the ratio ti/tv for sequence pairs versus corresponding number of whole substitutions with respect to
codon positions (1st+2nd or 3rd), with the pairwise ratios
and numbers of substitutions calculated in MEGA3 [61],
and plots worked out with the Microsoft Excel program.
Only ingroup species are included for saturation analysis.
Pairwise partition homogeneity test (PHT) and
phylogenetic analyses
Before the phylogenetic analyses, the NT data was subjected to pairwise PHT [62] between data partitions of different loci under either un-weighted or six-parameter
weighting parsimony scheme [63,64] with PAUP* 4.0b10
[65], with heuristic search for 1000 replicates. Modeltest
3.6 [66] was used to estimate parameters of DNA substitution model for the six-parameter MP, ML and BI analyses.

Phylogenetic analyses with NT data set were performed
using MP, ML and Bayesian inferring methods. The MP
tree was constructed with either un-weighted or sixparameter weighting parsimony methods with heuristic
search (initial trees obtained by 100 replicates random
addition; branch swapping with TBR algorithm). For the
six-parameter method, models specific to each locus were
implemented in PAUP*4.0b10 [65], with each substitution classes was weighted based on its substitution rate
(Rij, i.e., rate of transformation between nucleotide i and
j) estimated with Modeltest3.6 [66]: wij = -ln (Rij/∑Ri). The
weighting parameter stepmatrix for each locus was
adjusted for satisfaction of triangle inequality in
PAUP*4.0b10 [65]. To access the support level for each
node on the MP trees, bootstrap (BP) [67] analyses were
performed with 1000 replicates and heuristic search. The
MP analysis with AA data was performed with similar
strategy as that of the NT data set.
The ML analysis of NT data was performed using
PAUP*4.0b10 [65], with parameters assigned as follows:
base frequencies of A (respectively C, G and T) = 0.3089

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/87

(respectively 0.1385, 0.1319 and 0.4207); substitution
rates of A-C (respectively A-G, A-T, C-G, C-T and G-T) =
2.0353 (respectively 13.2831, 6.7964, 5.9419, 33.5370
and 1.0000); proportion of invariable sites (I) = 0.5765;
and gamma distribution shape parameter (α) = 0.8598.
Bayesian inferring was implemented in MrBayes3.1 [68].
The starting tree was randomly selected and four chains
were run. For the analysis with NT data set, parameters are
set as follows: "nst = 6" + "invgamma" applied to the character partition of mitochondrial genes, "nst = 6" +
"gamma" to that of the Adh gene, and "nst = 2" +
"gamma" to that of the 28S gene. Bayesian analyses of AA
data were performed with either the Poisson or the GTR
models, with gamma-distributed rate variation across
sites and a proportion of invariable sites. For all the Bayesian analyses, two independent runs were implemented in
parallel, with the Markov chains been sampled every 100
cycles. The runs were stopped after 2,000,000 cycles of
MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) for NT data, but
1,000,000 cycles for AA data, till the average deviation of
split frequencies fall well below 0.01. For all the runs,
1,000 trees sampled at early phase of the chain (well
before the end of this phase, the likelihood values stop to
increase, and start to fluctuate within a stable range) were
discarded, and the remainders were summarized to obtain
a majority rule tree which showing all the compatible partitions.
Estimates of divergence times in the obscura species group
Before estimating divergence times, relative-rate test using
the program Phyltest2.0 [69] is conducted to examine
constancy of sequence evolution between lineages in the
obscura group. Since no time calibration point of fossil
record or by geological dating is available for our estimation, we cite that used by Beckenbach et al. [9]: an interval
of 30–35 Mya for the divergence between the obscura and
melanogaster groups. The program r8s1.71 [70], which
enables estimating divergence time in the absence of a
molecular clock, is used to estimate the divergence times
in the obscura species group. A ML tree constructed with
mtDNA sequence data was used as the input tree file for
time estimating. The model for the ML search is selected
by Modeltest3.6 [66]: base frequencies are 0.3246,
0.1028, 0.1116 and 0.4610 for A, C, G and T, respectively;
rates = 3.4175, 25.8349, 10.1514, 4.7640, 86.1667 and
1.0000 for A-C, A-G, A-T, C-G, C-T and G-T, respectively;
I = 0.5629; α = 1.0481. A penalized likelihood (PL) [71]
method is used for divergence time reconstructing, with a
truncated Newton (TN) algorithm for finding optima of
the objective functions. Cross-validation are checked over
a range of smoothing values by set the parameters cvstart
= 0, cvinc = 0.5 and cvnum = 10. Divergence time for all
the nodes except for the root is estimated by rerunning of
the input data with a selected smoothing parameter (=

316, which has the lowest cross-validation score) by
checking of the cross-validation.
Statistic test of the temporal pattern of evolutionary
diversity
We perform a statistic test [33] of temporal pattern in the
obscura group. To reduce the effect of incomplete sampling of extant taxa, GenBank sequences of some additional obscura group species (Table 3) are also used. Based
on the aligned sequence of 27 obscura group species, a F84
distance data matrix is created, and a so-called KITSCH
tree is constructed, using the program DNADIST and
KITSCH, respectively, both packed in Phylip3.6 [72]. For
distance estimating using DNADIST, shape parameters of
the Gamma distribution (α = 1.0353) and base frequencies (A = 0.3132; C = 0.1401; G = 0.1320; T = 0.4147) are
estimated in Modeltest3.6 [66], and the ratio of ti/tv (=
1.1) is calculated in MEGA3 [61]. The branching times for
the resulted KITSCH tree were normalized between zero
(the time of the first branching event) and one (the
present), cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) [34] of
the scaled branching times for all the nodes (n = 25) in the
tree is plotted. The dissimilarity between the resulted
empirical CFD and expected (i.e., average) CFD specific
for same number of extant taxa was quantified using a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit statistic D
[34]. The average CFD for specific number of extant species has been generated by Wallenberg et al. [33] by computer simulations under null model of stochastic lineage
bifurcation and extinction. Therefore, we get the average
CFD for 27 extant taxa by interpolated those for 25 and 30
taxa [33].
