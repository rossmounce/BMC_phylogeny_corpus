Abstract
Background: Snake venom toxins evolve more rapidly than other proteins through accelerated
changes in the protein coding regions. Previously we have shown that accelerated segment switch
in exons to alter targeting (ASSET) might play an important role in its functional evolution of viperid
three-finger toxins. In this phenomenon, short sequences in exons are radically changed to
unrelated sequences and hence affect the folding and functional properties of the toxins.
Results: Here we analyzed other snake venom protein families to elucidate the role of ASSET in
their functional evolution. ASSET appears to be involved in the functional evolution of three-finger
toxins to a greater extent than in several other venom protein families. ASSET leads to replacement
of some of the critical amino acid residues that affect the biological function in three-finger toxins
as well as change the conformation of the loop that is involved in binding to specific target sites.
Conclusion: ASSET could lead to novel functions in snake venom proteins. Among snake venom
serine proteases, ASSET contributes to changes in three surface segments. One of these segments
near the substrate binding region is known to affect substrate specificity, and its exchange may have
significant implications for differences in isoform catalytic activity on specific target protein
substrates. ASSET therefore plays an important role in functional diversification of snake venom
proteins, in addition to accelerated point mutations in the protein coding regions. Accelerated
point mutations lead to fine-tuning of target specificity, whereas ASSET leads to large-scale
replacement of multiple functionally important residues, resulting in change or gain of functions.

Background
Snake venoms contain a mixture of proteins and polypeptides which exhibit various biochemical and pharmacological functions. These proteins and polypeptides are
classified into non-enzymatic and enzymatic proteins
which belong to a small number of superfamilies, such as
three-finger toxins (3FTx), Kunitz-type serine protease
inhibitors, phospholipase A2(PLA2) enzymes, serine proteases and metalloproteases [1-12]. Members of these

superfamilies have similar protein scaffolds but, at times,
differ markedly in their biological effects. For example,
members of 3FTx family exhibit a wide variety of specific
pharmacologic effects by targeting various receptors and
ion channels with high affinity and specificity. Short
chain and long chain α-neurotoxins antagonize muscle
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [5,12], κ-bungarotoxins
recognize neuronal nicotinic receptors [13], muscarinic
toxins are selective agonists/antagonists of distinct subPage 1 of 14

types of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors [14], fasciculins inhibit acetylcholinesterase [15], calciseptine and
related toxins block the L-type Ca2+ channels [16,16,17],
cardiotoxins/cytotoxins exert their toxicity by forming
pores in cell membranes [18], and dendroaspins are
antagonists of various cell-adhesion processes [19].
Similarly, other venom proteins, such as the Kunitz-type
serine protease inhibitors, have a conserved fold and are
structurally similar to bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
(BPTI) [20]. They have been reported to inhibit proteolytic activity of trypsin or chymotrypsin specifically
[3,21,21-23]. In addition, some inhibitor-like proteins
specifically block potassium and calcium channels [2427]. Snake venom PLA2 isoenzymes, also characterized by
a highly conserved fold, are known to induce various
pharmacological activities such as neurotoxic, myotoxic,
cardiotoxic, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet effects
through specific interaction with their target proteins (for
a review see [28]). Thus many subfamilies and isoforms of
snake venom serine proteases and metalloproteases act on
various components of the coagulation cascade and
induce procoagulant or anticoagulant effects, as well as
affect platelet aggregation, fibrinolytic and kallikreinkinin systems [29-35]. The isoforms of the different superfamilies are known to evolve through a process of gene
duplication followed by accelerated point mutations in
the protein coding regions.
In venom proteins, comparisons of cDNA and gene
sequences have shown that nonsynonymous nucleotide
substitutions (leading to change in amino acid residues)
are commonly greater than synonymous nucleotide substitutions (not producing change in amino acid residues)
in the protein coding region compared to the non-coding
(UTRs) and intron regions [36-38]. Thus, protein coding
regions of genes encoding 3FTxs [39-41], Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors [42], PLA2 enzymes [7,43,44] and
serine proteases [8] appear to be undergoing accelerated
point mutations, resulting in numerous isoforms. Individual point mutations affect one residue at a time, leading to small change in the surface characteristics of a
protein. Therefore, point mutations may contribute to
fine tuning of toxin specificities by (a) improving the specificity towards a particular receptor or ion channel; (b)
altering the specificity towards a closely related receptor or
ion channel; and (c) modifying the species specificity.
However, accelerated point mutations may not be sufficient to explain drastic changes in the molecular surface
needed for the observed targeting of toxins with conserved
scaffolds to diverse receptors or ion channels.
In a recent study, we identified five transcripts encoding
3FTxs from the cDNA library of venom gland tissues of
Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii [45]. These transcripts showed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/146

very low sequence similarity with elapid 3FTxs except for
the conserved signal peptide and the number and position of cysteines. A systematic comparison of their
sequences revealed that some of the segments in the
mature proteins were 80–100% identical, whereas other
segments were only 12.5–50% similar [46]. Some segments in the protein coding region seem to be exchanged
with distinctly different segments, keeping the structural
fold intact during their evolution. Interestingly, the segments in the introns of genes encoding these same proteins show high similarity (>85%) when present; and
profound differences in segments appear to be restricted
to exons only. Such switching of segments in the exon
alters the surface topology and charge of the mature protein, which might alter the molecular targets of 3FTxs and
contribute to the evolution of novel function. Therefore,
we proposed that the phenomenon of accelerated segment switch in exons to alter targeting (ASSET) might play
an important role in the evolution of 3FTxs in viperid
snake venoms [46].
Here we have analyzed isoforms of 3FTxs from elapid
snake venoms, as well as toxins from other protein superfamilies, to evaluate whether ASSET plays a role in their
evolution. Elapid 3FTxs have been found to undergo
changes due to ASSET as observed for viperid 3FTxs. Due
to such exchange of segments, functionally important residues are changed, which might significantly affect their
function. In some of these toxins, such change has lead to
the evolution of demonstrated novel functions [19,47],
and thus the 3FTx toxin family seem to be functionally
evolving through ASSET. In the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor family, ASSET does not seem to play an
important role in evolution, even though there are multiple isoforms. The enzymatic families, such as PLA2 and
metalloproteases, appear to be evolving more through
accelerated point mutations rather than ASSET. In these
families, some of the segments seem to be exchanged during their evolution, but functional implication of such
changes is not clearly understood. However, in the serine
protease family, three segments near the substrate binding
region have been found to be undergoing accelerated
exchange of segments, and at least one of them may have
significant implications for their substrate specificity.

Results and Discussion
Three-finger toxin (3FTx) family
3FTxs form a well-characterized superfamily of non-enzymatic proteins. They have a canonical three-finger fold of
extending β- sheeted loops that is stabilized by four conserved disulphide bridges in the core region. Until
recently, this family of proteins was thought to be present
only in elapid venom [48]. However, 3FTxs have now
been reported in colubrid venoms and in viperid venom
gland transcriptomes as well [45,49-52]. Different iso-

forms of 3FTxs bind to various receptors/acceptors and
exhibit diverse pharmacological functions despite their
similar folding (for a review see [53]). Functionally
important residues that are involved in interacting with
the target receptors/ion channels generally reside in the
tip of the loops [54]. Therefore the amino acid sequences,
length and conformation of the loops play important role
in their functional specificity (for reviews see [53,55].

fifth disulphide bridge in the first loop of short chain
3FTxs is due to exchange of segments (ASSET). This additional fifth disulphide bridge does not change the overall
fold but it causes subtle changes in the first loop which are
known to have functional implications [56]. Further, the
number of amino acid residues in this segment differs
among the toxins and hence would lead to change in the
length of the loop.

Amino acid sequences of 3FTxs isolated from venoms of
the same genus of elapids were grouped together and analyzed for ASSET and point mutations (Figure 1). The segments with high identity (60–100%) are shown in similar
colors, whereas those with low identity (13%–50%) are
shown in dissimilar colors. For example, among Naja
3FTxs, the S2 segments in P29179, Q9YGI2 and Q9W713
show 60–100% identity (shown in turquoise), and the
same segment shows 91.7% identity between O73856
and P01443 (shown in green). However, they share low
identity with corresponding segments in other species
(shown in various colors). Thus, Naja 3FTxs have seven
different types of S2 segments. Overall, there are nine (S1–
S9) distinct segments (Figure 1) with varied identities, and
within the same genus some segments are represented by
more than one type. S1 (signal peptide) and S8 segments
are the most conserved among all elapid 3FTxs, whereas
S5 and S9 are found only in long chain 3FTxs. The replacement of segments has been found to occur only in exons
II and III (exon-intron boundaries are marked by red
dashed lines), while exon I codes for the highly conserved
signal peptide in all 3FTxs. Thus, as in the case of Sistrurus
3FTxs, elapid toxins also show discrete replacement of segments in protein coding regions. Such accelerated
exchange of segments (ASSET) results in drastic changes in
function (discussed below).

As mentioned above, the loops play a crucial role in the
recognition of target receptors/ion channels. For example,
the third loop in dendroaspin (or mambin; P01413) contains the "RGD" tripeptide sequence (underlined in Figure
1) which is known to bind to platelet glycoprotein (GP
IIb-IIIa; αIIbβIII) and cause inhibition of platelet aggregation [19]. The S7 segment containing this sequence is
replaced in other Dendroaspis toxins (Figure 1). This
exchange of segment seems to be responsible for the loss
of antiplatelet function in them. In one of the toxins
(P25684), this segment is replaced with a segment containing the TAMW residues (underlined in Figure 1). In
calciseptine, FS2 and other related toxins, this sequence is
known to be involved in binding to L-type Ca2+ channels
[47]. This segment in dendroaspin and FS2 shows a different conformation (Figure 2) which might also influence
their function. As shown in Figure 1, the S7 segment is the
most variable among the Dendroaspis toxins and may
result in functional diversification due to accelerated
exchange.

The three-finger folds of 3FTxs are held together by four
conserved disulfide bridges. However, some 3FTxs have a
fifth disulfide bridge in either the second loop (long chain
neurotoxins and κ-neurotoxins [56]) or the first loop
(non-conventional toxins [57]). The insertion of the fifth
disulfide bridge in the second loop of long chain 3FTx is
due to a change in the intron-exon boundary. This alteration in the intron-exon boundary is due to an insertion of
a single nucleotide "A" in intron 2 which causes a shift in
the splicing site [40], leading to the insertion of a short
segment (S5) containing a cysteine residue. In the S4 segment, there is also a frame shift due to the deletion of a
nucleotide, leading to a completely different sequence
which also contains a new cysteine residue. Both cysteine
residues form the fifth disulphide bridge and a cyclic
structure in the second loop that is important to their
binding to α7 receptors with high affinity [58]. The insertion of this short segment in long chain 3FTxs leads to a
new function – binding to α7 receptors. In contrast, the

Short chain and long chain α-neurotoxins are known to
antagonize muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
resulting in flaccid paralysis [5,12]. The structure-function
relationships of α-neurotoxins have been thoroughly
studied using both chemical modification and genetic
engineering approaches [54,59-61]. Unlike dendroaspin
and calciseptine (Figure 1), the functional site in the neurotoxins is discontinuous and is distributed on all three
loops [54]. In erabutoxin a (BAC78199), the important
functional residues involved in binding to Torpedo electroplax or to muscle nAChR (α2βγδ) are Lys27, Trp29 (S3),
Asp31, Phe32, Arg33 (S5) and Lys47 (S7) (underlined in Figure 1) [56]. Although Lys27, Trp29 and Arg33 are conserved
in all Laticauda toxins, the other critical residues (Asp31,
Phe32 and Lys47) are replaced via exchange of segments.
We hypothesize that these segment exchanges may have a
direct impact on their ability to bind to Torpedo or muscle
(α2βγδ) receptors.
It is also important to note that there are minor changes
in amino acid residues within the identical segments
(highlighted in white in Additional file 1) and these
changes are due to an accelerated rate of point mutations.
Both ASSET and accelerated point mutations have contributed to the functional diversity of elapid 3FTXs; ASSET

leads to major changes in the surface properties, resulting
in targeting of new receptors, while accelerated point
mutations lead to fine-tuning of binding to the same
receptors through minor alterations of the surface charge
and topology.
Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor family
Snake venom Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors have
been reported from both elapid and viperid venoms.
Structurally, they are similar to Kunitz/BPTI inhibitors
with a conserved fold stabilized by three disulphide
bridges [6]. As with other toxin families, the isoforms are
encoded by a multigene family and have evolved through
gene duplication and positive selection [8]. The isoforms
from the same genus are grouped together as above and
analyzed for ASSET and accelerated point mutations
(Additional file 2).

Though the snake venom Kunitz-type serine protease
inhibitor family contains multiple isoforms, functionally
they are not as diverse as other venom protein superfamilies, and they can be divided into either non-neurotoxic or neurotoxic homologs. Non-neurotoxic homologs
inhibit either trypsin or chymotrypsin, while neurotoxic
homologs act as calcium and potassium channel blockers
which do not have protease inhibitory activity [26,27,42].
Structurally, both groups have a conserved fold similar to
BPTI, but the inhibitor binding loops and the β turn
regions have undergone adaptive evolution, resulting in
new biological activities [6]. Analysis of the amino acid
sequences of the isoforms shows that there is no radical
change in the amino acid residues in the mature proteins,

as observed in 3FTxs. However, they have undergone
adaptive evolution through accelerated point mutation
(Additional file 2). In calcicludine and dendrotoxin-I, the
N-terminal part and overall conformation play a significant role in calcium and potassium channel-blocking
activity (Additional file 2). This has been demonstrated by
synthesizing chimeras containing the N-terminal (1–30)
of calcicludine and C-terminal (31–60) of dendrotoxin-I,
and vice versa [24]. However, there are not enough
Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors and dendrotoxin
sequences from Dendroaspis species in the database in
order to determine if they have evolved through ASSET.
Similarly, the B chain of β-bungarotoxin (from Bungarus)
is also a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor but does not
have protease inhibitory activity; however, it contributes
to neurotoxicity [62]. The interaction of the B chain with
the potassium channel was predicted to be localized
opposite of the anti-protease loop, between residues 27–
30 [63]. In addition to this, the mature protein shows
accelerated point mutations which resulted in the introduction of a cysteine residue at the C-terminal end
(underlined in Additional file 2). This extra cysteine residue forms the disulphide bridge with chain A [63]. Further, the C-terminal region of chain B shows a
conformational change due to its interaction with the
chain A and accounts for the lack of protease inhibitor
activity [63]. Unlike 3FTxs, where ASSET has played an
important role in the evolution of new functions, deviation of some members of Kunitz-type serine protease
inhibitors from protease inhibitory activity is mainly due
to accelerated point mutations. This might explain the
low functional diversity in this group of toxins, even
though they have multiple isoforms.
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) family
PLA2 enzymes are one of the best-studied hydrolytic
enzymes and are found abundantly in nature. Snake venoms are a good source of these enzymes and often contain
multiple isoenzymes. In addition to a role in the digestion
of prey, they induce a wide variety of pharmacological
effects in prey/victims (for a review see [64]). It has been
well documented that accelerated point mutations have
occurred in the protein coding regions, and this adaptive
mode of evolution might also be responsible for acquisition of new functions [65]. We analyzed the elapid and
viperids PLA2 isoenzymes to determine if ASSET has
played any role in the functional evolution of these toxins.

Comparison of the amino acid sequences of PLA2 isoenzymes in all genera revealed that the N-terminal region
seems to be undergoing exchange of segment except in
Naja species (Figure 3; segments are shown in different
colors). This segment is 13–14 amino acids long (forms
helix B in several PLA2 enzymes) and lies between the first
helix and the calcium-binding loop. Differences in

exchange within the same species seem to arise due to
ASSET, as there is more than one amino acid replacement.
As this segment lies near the calcium-binding region, it
might affect catalysis due to changes in the conformation
in this region. For example, in viperid PLA2 enzymes, the
sequence LEETGKLAIPSYSS (in AAZ53179) is replaced
with an unrelated sequence VKMTGKEAVHSYAI (in
ABD24039), which clearly imparts significant conformational changes (Figure 4). However, the impact of such
replacements on catalysis is not clear. In elapids within
the same genera, this segment is represented by two differ-

ent types, but in viperids there are several types. Interestingly, in AAD56409 and the γ subunit of taipoxin, as a
result of this replacement, two cysteine residues are
inserted. These additional cysteines form the extra disulphide bridge, in addition to the seven conserved disulphide bridges of PLA2 enzymes [66]. Further, the residues
in this short segment have been proposed to play crucial
role in some of the pharmacological effects of PLA2
enzymes [67]. Ammodytoxin A from the venom of Vipera
ammodytes ammodytes interacts with human FXa through
surface residues distributed in helices and the calcium
binding loop. One of the helices (helix B), which is undergoing accelerated segment exchange, is involved in this
interaction [67]. Replacement of critical amino acid residues through segment exchange can influence the biological activity of PLA2 enzymes. Other than this segment, the
mature protein in all the groups appears to be evolving via
accelerated point mutations. Though elapid and viperid
PLA2 enzymes have evolved from different lineages, it is
interesting to note that the exchange of the segment in
both groups occurs at the same position. Such an
exchange may impart conformational and/or functional
changes.
In addition to this exchange of a segment near the calcium
binding region, the presence or absence of another segment has been observed in exon III of Austrelaps superbus
PLA2 enzymes (Figure 3, shown in green color). This segment represents the pancreatic loop, an ancestral feature
found in the pancreatic PLA2 enzymes. Pancreatic PLA2

Alignment of serine protease isoforms from snake venoms
Alignment of serine protease isoforms from snake venoms. Protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI database
and are presented with their accession numbers. The signal peptide is highlighted in grey color. The number of sequences of
closely related homologues is shown in brackets. The segments undergoing exchange are marked as i, ii and iii and are given
different color coding. The active site residues are marked with asterisks.

enzymes show low hydrolytic activity due to the presence
of this loop, and the deletion of this loop in porcine PLA2
results in 16 times higher catalytic activity [68]. Thus, the
deletion of pancreatic loop in venom PLA2 enzymes plays
an important role in the evolution of catalytically more
active enzymes.
Accelerated point mutations in the mature protein of PLA2
enzymes are known to play important roles in functional
evolution [37,43,69,70]. These substitutions appear to
occur mostly in the surface residues and thus alter the specificity of targeting to various tissues or cells, resulting in
distinct pharmacological effects [71]. Though we
observed ASSET near the calcium-binding region, its role
in functional evolution of PLA2s is not yet clear.

Serine protease family
Snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs) are one of the well
characterized families of enzymes that affect the hemostatic system. They act on various components of the coagulation cascade, fibrinolytic and kallikrein-kinin systems
as well as on platelets to cause significant perturbance of
the haemostatic system [31,72-75]. This family of
enzymes are believed to have evolved from glandular kallikrein and trypsin-like enzymes, as they have similar gene
structure and share common three-dimensional structure
[76]. Similar to other multigene families, they have

natus edwardsii and Bothrops jararaca obtained from the
database to analyze for ASSET.
Comparison of the isoenzymes among the same group
reveals that the signal peptide is highly conserved in all
the groups, and the mature protein shows accelerated evolution. Particularly, three segments in the mature proteins
seem to be undergoing accelerated exchange. These segments are identified in all the different genera and named
as i, ii and iii (Figure 5; shown in different colors). Among
them, segment iii is the most conserved segment and is
represented by only four different types (shown in green,
light blue, red and magenta, in Figure 5) across the genera
whereas segments i and ii exist in several different forms.
These segments were further analyzed to see if a similar
pattern exists across different genera (Figure 6). Although
some similar patterns emerge, the data strongly supports
accelerated exchange of these segments. Further, the segment exchanges appear to be random and we could not
link them through simple molecular phylogeny.
It is interesting to note that all three segment exchanges
occur on the surface of the protein (Figure 7) which is
important for substrate binding and interactions with ligands. SVSPs are all characterized by the presence of a
highly reactive serine residue (Ser) in the active site. In
addition, His57 and Asp102 present in the active cleft are
important for catalysis (marked with an asterisk in Figure
6); this active cleft is located at the junction of two sixstranded β-barrels [77]. The entrance to this active site
cleft is influenced by several surface loops of the protein.
Asp97, present in segment iii, is the most important residue in substrate recognition, and a D97N mutant shows
markedly decreased substrate binding capacity [78]. This
residue (D97 in Q91516 (PSV-PA) is underlined in Figure

5. However, in other isoforms from Trimeresurus, this segment PNRKKDDE (shown in turquoise color) is replaced
with either NCSNNFTK (shown in red color) or LSSNNDTE (shown in green color) with the loss of critical Asp
residue. Thus ASSET may have a direct impact on the substrate binding of these isoforms. On the other hand,
changes of segment i and ii might not influence the catalytic activity, as they are away from the active cleft and are
not involved in substrate binding (Figure 7). However,
they might still contribute to targeting to various tissues or
proteins as they are fully exposed on the surface of these
enzymes. This family of proteins seems to be evolving via
both ASSET and accelerated point mutations.
Metalloprotease family
Snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) are the main
toxic components present in the venom of many Viperidae [2,11]. They are synthesized as zymogens containing
multidomain precursors and undergo proteolytic processing. Structurally, they are categorized into four types, PI,
PII, PIII and PIV, based on the presence of different
domains and their quaternary structure [9,79]; the metalloprotease domain is present in all the subtypes. Catalytically it is the most important domain and contains the
zinc binding site with a consensus sequence of HEXXHXXGXXH [80]. This catalytic domain is known to play
an important role in inducing hemorrhage during envenomation and is highly conserved [81]. SVMPs induce
hemorrhage at the site of the bite by cleaving proteins in
the basement membrane and subsequently weakening
capillaries [82]. At present, not many isoforms of metalloproteases have been reported from the same species.
Sequences from Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii, Macrovipera
lebetina and Echis ocellatus were obtained from the database and analyzed for point mutations and ASSET (Figure
8). Most of the residues in the mature protein seem to be
conserved, except for a few residues which have been
replaced through accelerated point mutations. However,
in the isoforms of Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii venom, the
cysteine-rich domain seems to be undergoing exchange of
segments (shown in red/green colors). Similarly, in the
spacer region between the metalloprotease and the disintegrin-like domains of Macrovipera lebetina isoforms, 11
amino acid residues have been deleted in one of the isoforms (Figure 8). These two regions were analyzed in the
crystal structure of catrocollastatin/vascular apoptosisinducing protein (VAP) 2B from Crotalus atrox venom,
which possesses metalloproteinase/disintegrin/cysteinerich (MDC) domains (Figure 9). The segment represented
by VGEECDCGTPE is a part of the shoulder domain containing one of the calcium binding regions, and this calcium binding region is absent in one of the isoforms of
Macrovipera lebetina metalloprotease. The other segment,
highlighted with red color, is the most variable and divergent among the ADAM/adamalysin/reprolysin protein

family and is known as hyper-variable region. This hypervariable region has been predicted to be a potential
exosite for target recognition [83]. This segment in one of
the isoforms of Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii has been
replaced with another segment (highlighted in green
color) and hence might recognize a different substrate or
lose its substrate binding property.

Molecular mechanism of ASSET
Previously, we discussed the possible molecular mechanisms of ASSET, including splicing variation, recombination, accumulation of point mutations and independent
recruitment events [46]. Nevertheless, we believe that
none of these explanations are satisfactory. Splicing variations, such as alternative splicing and changes in the splicing site, can lead to insertion/deletion of alternate
segments in the mature protein. However, all but one seg-

ment change occur within the exons and not at the intronexon boundaries. In the long chain 3FTxs only, the insertion of a segment occurs at the intron-exon boundary due
to a shift in the splicing site (discussed above). Genetic
recombination might also give rise to replacement of segments in the mature protein. However, the segment
exchanges observed in the venom proteins are too small,
and canonical recombination processes cannot explain
exchange of short segments. The possibility of accumulation of point mutations producing the observed change in
segments cannot be ruled out unequivocally, as venom
proteins have been well-documented to evolve through
accelerated point mutations [7,8,37,39-43,84]. In such
circumstances, this would have to occur over many generations to attain the observed change in segments, and
intermediates would have to be selected via positive selection. Further, the same point mutations would have to

Surface residues of a protein molecule are important for
their physicochemical properties as well as for their interactions with biomolecules, including other proteins.
Accordingly, the alteration of the conformation and surface properties indeed affects the pharmacological properties of protein toxins. In an earlier paper, we showed that
in PLA2 enzymes the surface residues have undergone natural substitution 2.6–3.5 times faster than the buried residues and proposed that accelerated point mutations
preferentially target the surface residues in PLA2 enzymes,
leading to the evolution of new isoforms with distinct
functions [71]. As shown here, ASSET also targets surface
residues in 3FTXs, PLA2 enzymes, serine proteases and
metalloproteases (Figure 2, 4, 7 and 9). Accelerated point
mutations result in finer modifications to the surface
topology and/or electrostatic potential, whereas ASSET
drastically alters the surface, essentially instantaneously
producing large-scale changes in the ligand interaction
site(s). The molecular mechanisms of both accelerated
point mutation and ASSET are not clearly understood, but
both phenomena play a crucial role in the evolution of
snake venom proteins.

Conclusion
occur independently in several unrelated lineages to produce the same segment composition. Thus, odds are
against the accumulation of point mutations as an explanation. The 3FTxs showing these exchanges could have
occurred through independent recruitment events, but
significant similarities in protein sequence and gene structure (particularly high similarity among intron sequences)
show that they have evolved from a common ancestor.
The observed changes in protein segments could also be
due to insertion/deletion of 1–2 nucleotides, resulting in
a frame shift and hence altered protein sequence. In such
a case, a similar number of nucleotide(s) must be
removed/added in a downstream region, respectively, to
get back into the original open reading frame. Therefore,
we carefully analyzed each of these segment exchanges at
the nucleotide level. Only one segment, RKCHNSPLSLVYQ (S2 in Q8UUK0), is changed to RKCNKLVPLFYK in P01443 (Figure 1A) due to deletion and insertion
of nucleotides. In this case, there is an insertion of A at the
78th position (from the start codon) and a deletion of four
nucleotides downstream (Additional file 3). Therefore,
none of the above possibilities explain the observed
exchange of segments in the exons. It is important to note
that in spite of the segment exchanges, the cysteine residues, which maintain the three dimensional fold, are conserved in 3FTxs. Although the molecular mechanism of
the exchange of segments is not yet understood, these

Elapid 3FTxs, similar to viperid 3FTxs (Doley et al., 2008),

ASSET affects the entire mature protein of 3FTxs except for
segment S8, which is highly conserved. In serine proteases, three of the surface segments are changed rapidly
by ASSET, but the rest of the mature protein evolves only
by accelerated point mutations. In PLA2 enzymes and metalloproteases, only one and three surface segments
(respectively) are changed via ASSET. In all these superfamilies of toxins, ASSET most likely affects their functional properties. However, serine protease inhibitors
have evolved by only accelerated point mutations. We
propose that ASSET occurs first, resulting in drastic
changes in functionally important surface regions, followed by accelerated point mutations in those regions
which fine-tune the target specificity. Although the molecular mechanisms of ASSET and accelerated point mutations are unknown, both contribute to the evolution of
snake venom toxins and both help to explain the observed
functional diversity of toxins and the evolution of new
functions in snake venom protein superfamilies.

Methods
Sequence analysis and identification of segments
The protein and cDNA sequences were obtained from the
NCBI database. Sequence alignments were done using the
DNAMAN program and by manual examination. The

intron-exon boundary (marked by a red dashed line in the
figures) was identified by comparing the gene and their
respective cDNA sequences. In those toxins whose gene
structure is not available, the intron-exon boundary was
identified by comparing with other toxins whose boundary is known. These segments are identified by comparing
with the corresponding sequences, and the point of deletion in amino acid sequence was identified as the boundary of most of the segments. We have analyzed the
sequences in different species, but there is no absolute
trend in defining the segment, other than high sequence
identity. Color coding was used to distinguish segments
with distinct % identity; segments with >50% identity are
shown in the same color, whereas segments with <50%
identity are shown in different colors. Ribbon and surface
models were generated from PDB files using DS ViewerPro software.

Three-finger toxins from Naja species showing point mutations. The
segments undergoing exchanges are given different color coding. The residues showing point mutations are shown in white and red type whereas
those that are conserved are in black. The gaps are represented by "-". This
demonstrates accelerated point mutations occur in various segments and
the segment exchange is not due to these point mutations. Similarly threefinger toxins from other snake venoms as well as toxins from other families
show point mutations through out various segments (data not shown).
