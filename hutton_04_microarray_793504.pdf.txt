Abstract
Background: In this study we have built and mined a gene expression database composed of 65
diverse mouse tissues for genes preferentially expressed in immune tissues and cell types. Using
expression pattern criteria, we identified 360 genes with preferential expression in thymus, spleen,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymph nodes (unstimulated or stimulated), or in vitro activated
T-cells.
Results: Gene clusters, formed based on similarity of expression-pattern across either all tissues
or the immune tissues only, had highly significant associations both with immunological processes
such as chemokine-mediated response, antigen processing, receptor-related signal transduction,
and transcriptional regulation, and also with more general processes such as replication and cell
cycle control. Within-cluster gene correlations implicated known associations of known genes, as
well as immune process-related roles for poorly described genes. To characterize regulatory
mechanisms and cis-elements of genes with similar patterns of expression, we used a new version
of a comparative genomics-based cis-element analysis tool to identify clusters of cis-elements with
compositional similarity among multiple genes. Several clusters contained genes that shared 5–6 ciselements that included ETS and zinc-finger binding sites. cis-Elements AP2 EGRF ETSF MAZF SP1F
ZF5F and AREB ETSF MZF1 PAX5 STAT were shared in a thymus-expressed set; AP4R E2FF
EBOX ETSF MAZF SP1F ZF5F and CREB E2FF MAZF PCAT SP1F STAT cis-clusters occurred in
activated T-cells; CEBP CREB NFKB SORY and GATA NKXH OCT1 RBIT occurred in stimulated
lymph nodes.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates a series of analytic approaches that have allowed the
implication of genes and regulatory elements that participate in the differentiation, maintenance,
and function of the immune system. Polymorphism or mutation of these could adversely impact
immune system functions.

Background
The immune system is composed of a multiplicity of individual cell types that derive from a relatively small
number of immuno-hematopoietic progenitors that
undergo complex developmental and exposure-driven
differentiation and activation. Cell-type specific gene
expression is driven to a large measure by complex transcriptional regulation that orchestrates differential expression of a wide variety of genes necessary to accomplish
immune effector functions. A number of specific transcription factors (TFs) which regulate gene expression in
immune system cell types have been identified, largely
through gene knockout experiments and isolation of protein complexes that bind to regulatory regions of target
genes. Examples include PU.1/Ets, Ikaros, E2A, EBF,
PAX5, GATA3, NFAT, cMYB, and OCT-2 [1-4]. These proteins bind to clusters of cis-regulatory elements in multiple diverse combinations to give rise to specific patterns of
gene expression [5]. However, the layout of regulatory
and coding regions is not known for most genes that are
preferentially expressed in lymphocytes and immune tissues (see, for examples, [6-11]). Based on the nearly completed nucleotide sequences of the mouse and human
http://
genomes
(http://genome.ucsc.edu[12];
www.ensembl.org[13]), we have sought to expand our
knowledge of the structure and function of compartmentspecific genes, and in particular, to find clusters of cis-elements that bind TFs and regulate gene expression during
biological processes. DNA sequences of both coding
regions and non-coding regions which harbor cis-elements that govern expression, are phylogenetically conserved [14-16]. This conservation of functionally
important regions of DNA underpins current methods of
identifying putative regulatory regions by comparative
sequence analysis. In practice, finding relevant clusters of
cis-elements is difficult and computationally intensive.
High-throughput gene expression profiling provides a
powerful approach to the investigation of relative transcriptional activity as a function of biological differentiation across a variety of cells and tissues. Published
examples that probe a wide variety of distinct, differentiated materials include the Human Gene Expression
(HuGE) Index database http://www.hugeindex.org[17]
and the GNF (Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research
Foundation; http://web.gnf.org/) database of human and
mouse gene expression [18]. These resources provide
access to patterns of expression of a significant fraction
(15–25%) of all mouse and human genes in several dozen
tissues and cell types. We have created a large database
locally, which has permit investigators from our campus
to profile gene expression in mouse tissues and cell types
specific to their interests [19]. To do this, we used the
Incyte Mouse GEM1 microarray, an 8638 element spotted
cDNA gene expression platform and a universal reference

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/82

design that employed poly A+ mRNA was prepared from
whole day-1 postnatal mouse. Two channel Cy3-Cy5
microarray hybridization technology was used to identify
relative strength of signals from each element of the array
for a specific tissue. From this database, we identified 360
cDNAs on the microarray that exhibit preferential expression in immune tissues such as lymph nodes, thymus, and
activated T-cells relative to most other types of tissues. We
identified 333 genes that encode these sequences and
have grouped them by biological functions and by patterns of expression.
Cis-element clusters that are conserved in pairs of
orthologs are strong predictors of regulatory regions
within mammalian genes [15,20,21]. We have used this
method to identify putative regulatory modules, which
are clusters of conserved cis-regulatory elements that occur
in coordinately regulated genes of the immune system
and may play a role in controlling their expression during
development or mature cell function. Several of the modules identified through this approach contain cis-elements
whose biological relevance has been experimentally validated in previous studies. Other computationally identified modules from this immunomic database have not
been studied in detail, but the results and a tool to analyze
them further, are provided at the website http://cis
mols.cchmc.org[22]. Taken together these data provide
valuable guidance to the design of experiments that seek
to identify regulatory modules in genes with specific patterns of expression.

Results
Selection of set of immune genes
Our goal is to identify genes, which are essential for the
differentiation, maintenance, and function of the
immune system, and their associated regulatory elements.
Polymorphisms or mutation in these might underlie wellknown variation among individuals in effectiveness of
their immune response. Mouse immune genes were identified from our gene expression database constructed
using the 8638 element microarray and probed with
mRNA prepared from 65 normal adult and fetal tissues.
We chose to select relevant genes by collecting those
expressed above a threshold value rather than by statistical analysis of variance. Given the small number of replicates and the large number of comparisons being made,
we would not have enough statistical power to detect differentially expressed genes by using traditional statistical
tests with appropriate specificity. In addition, with the
reduced specificity of statistical tests, the biologically nonsignificant, but somewhat reproducible differences in
gene expression will obscure changes that are of biologically significant magnitude, but vary from replicate to replicate. Expression of genes is not discontinuous from
tissue to tissue, but varies quantitatively over a wide range.

The threshold to distinguish expressed from nonexpressed genes was set to identify the hundred or so most
highly expressed gene in each relevant tissue.
Genes were considered to be "immune genes" if they were
more highly expressed in one or more of 6 immune tissues (lymph nodes from normal and antigen stimulated
mice, thymus, activated T-cells, spleen, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells) than in most other normal adult and
fetal mouse tissues. 680 genes were identified where the
amount of cDNA hybridized from one or more immune
tissues was 3 or more times greater than hybridization of
cDNAs from the reference whole mouse (Figure 1A). To
increase specificity, the 680 genes were then filtered to
remove those with 2-fold or greater expression in normal
brain, spinal cord, heart, kidney, pancreas or stomach.
These tissues were chosen because they do not play a role
in the immune response, contain very few cells of the
immune system, and should not express immune-specific
genes. By contrast, no effort was made to remove genes
expressed in the intestinal tract, lung, or fetus where cells
of the immune system might be expected. The resulting
set of 483 genes was examined by hierarchical cluster
analysis. Spleen and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
were noted to express genes encoding proteins of immature erythroid cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
To remove these, the set was restricted to genes that were
expressed 2 fold or greater in at least one of stimulated
and unstimulated lymph nodes, activated T cells, or thymus. The end result is a set of 360 expressed sequences,
which we call "immune" genes (Figure 1A and 1B). 265 of
the expressed sequences were linked to specific genes and
gene symbols, using the Mouse Genome Database (MGD)
http://informatics.jax.org[23] and NCBI-LocusLink [24].
The remainders were analyzed using MouseBLAST and
BLAT [12] to find sequence homologies with known
genes. An additional 78 sequences could be linked to specific genes, 9 (seven occurring twice and one occurring
thrice) of these were redundant, so that a total of 333 previously known unique genes were represented by the 360
expressed sequences. 292 of these genes were assigned a
probable function, using criteria described in Methods. 5
sequences were repetitive elements and 12 sequences
could not be linked to a known gene or function. Gene
symbols, names, functions, and extensive additional
annotations are provided in the supplementary materials
(Additional file 1). Human orthologs of these mouse
immune genes were sought by sequence homology.
Where found, pairs of mouse-human orthologs were
annotated with regard to function and were analyzed for
phylogenetically conserved regulatory regions.
Hierarchical clustering of genes and tissues
Hierarchical tree clustering of the 360 sequences and 65
normal adult and fetal tissues was carried out by Pearson

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/82

correlation using the log of the average of the relative
expression ratio for each gene as measured in replicate
arrays (Figure 1A). While the band of high expression
extends across the 6 immune tissues, relative expression of
each gene within the immune tissues shows distinct patterning (Figure 1B). For intestinal and fetal tissues, the
areas of high expression are localized and do not include
the majority of the immune genes. Function of the genes
expressed in these tissues will be described.
Function of the immune genes
A putative function could be assigned to 298 expressed
sequences (Additional file 1) based on one or more
known functional annotation or sequence analysis-based
structural classifiers. This annotation is independent of
pattern of expression and gives an overview of the types of
functions carried out by immune genes. Six functional
groups derived from these annotations are shown in Table
1. The HGNC http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomencla
ture[25] and MGI http://informatics.jax.org[23] approved
gene symbols are used in the table, although many of
these genes are better known by their aliases as provided
in supplementary materials. Table 1 shows 59 genes that
have functions associated with defense-immune or
defense response (immune is a subcategory of defense in
GO annotations). Defense-immune genes were more
directly related to antigen recognition and receptor signaling of T- and B-lymphocytes than defense genes, although
the separation of defense and immune is somewhat arbitrary. 47 genes in Table 1 are involved in cell signaling, 14
in apoptosis, 8 in chemotaxis, and 6 in lysosomes. Additional lists of genes grouped by function and shown in the
supplementary materials include 39 in transcription, 23
in DNA replication/cell cycle control, 20 in protein synthesis, 13 in transport, and 10 in adhesion. Smaller groups
of genes that are important in function of the immune system include protein trafficking and degradation, and
maintenance of the cytoskeleton. Functions carried out by
some of the genes that are highly expressed in immune tissues are common to cells and tissues that are actively proliferating and synthesizing proteins. These include, for
example, genes involved in DNA synthesis and the cell
cycle such as the minichromosome maintenance proteins,
Mcm2 through Mcm7; the DNA polymerases and primase,
Pola2, Cdc6, Prim1; the processivity factor Pcna, and cyclin
E1, Ccne1. They play a role in regulation of chromosomal
replication in many types of cells [26]. In the immune tissues, high expression of these genes is characteristic of
activated T-cells, which are proliferating. Similarly, other
immune genes are involved in protein synthesis and are
not specific to the immune system. Twelve immune genes
encode ribosomal proteins.

There are sets of genes that work together to produce the
cellular and humoral immune responses. For example,

Figure 1
Expression profiles of sequences across tissues
Expression profiles of sequences across tissues: Hierarchical tree clustering of genes and tissues was carried out using
Pearson correlation and the log of the average of the relative expression ratio for each gene, as measured in replicate arrays.
Sequences with similar expression patterns across all tissues are clustered together in the resulting trees, the closeness of the
sequences in sub trees is a measure of how closely correlated their expression is. (A) Hierarchical tree clustering of genes
across 65 normal adult and fetal tissues. 680 sequences were identified that were highly expressed in thymus, unstimulated and
stimulated lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in vitro activated T-cells. To increase specificity, 320
sequences were removed because they were also highly expressed in one or more non-lymphoid tissues, as described in the
text. The pattern of expression of the remaining 360 "immune genes" across tissues is shown. (B) Hierarchical tree clustering
of 360 immune genes across 18 normal adult and fetal tissues. There are 3 major groups of tissues that show clusters of highly
expressed "immune genes" These include the 6 immune tissues, various segments of adult intestine, and fetal day 16.5 lung and
intestine. Less prominent clusters are seen in adult lung and liver. Genes in these clusters are described in the text. While the
band of high expression extends across all genes for the 6 immune tissues, relative expression of each gene within the immune
tissues shows distinct patterning.

molecules of the major histocompatibility complex
present foreign peptides to T cells. They are encoded by
genes such H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-DMa, H2-Eb1, H2-K, H2-L,
H2-Oa, H2-Ob, H2-Q7, and B2m (Table 1, Defense –
Immune). Signal transduction pathways are abundant
and play critical roles in the function of lymphocytes.
They link the recognition of antigens or chemokines by
receptors on the cell surface to the transcription of genes
required for cell division and new protein synthesis. This
process of lymphocyte activation requires an intracellular
signaling cascade with participation of protein kinases, Gproteins, and products of cleavage of membrane phospholipids [27-29] (Table 1, Signal). Janus kinases,
encoded by genes such as Jak1, phosphorylate both signal
transducers and activators of transcription (Stat1, Stat3,
and Stat4) as part of the lymphocytes' response to
cytokines. The product of Rac2 is a G protein that participates in the cascade of kinases leading to activation of TFs.
Chemokines are a family of small proteins that activate
cells such as lymphocytes as part of the host response to

infection. Genes that encode the chemokines (Ccl4, Ccl6,
Ccl19, Ccl22, Cxcl13) and chemokine receptors (Cxcr4 and
Ccr2) (Table 1, Chemotaxis) are highly expressed in
immune tissues.
Twenty-one sequences representing 19 known genes were
highly expressed in gastrointestinal tissue (Figure 1B). Of
these, 5 were classified as "Defense – Immune", including
B2m, H2-Q7, Tcrg, Tlr1, and H2-K. Of the 51 genes
expressed in fetal tissues (Figure 1B), 46 are annotated.
Sixteen genes functioned in protein synthesis and 13 in
cell cycle/DNA synthesis. No "Defense" or "DefenseImmune" genes were highly expressed in fetal tissues.
Genes expressed in fetal tissues reflect active growth and
proliferation of cells. In immune tissues, these same genes
are particularly well expressed in activated T-cells and thymus, where cell proliferation is occurring.

Computationally predicted clusters of cis-elements in the promoter region of mouse H2-K and its human
ortholog HLA-A: The ATG of human HLA-A is at position 10,001 while that of mouse H2-K is at 10,463. Thus, the region represented relative to ATG is -305 to +97 (human) and -653 to -293 (mouse). Additionally, these regions correspond to chr 6:

biochemical studies. Experimentally identified, conserved, regulatory elements within the promoter of MHC
class I genes include: an enhancer A element (two NFKB
sites), an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE),
site α (cAMP-response element), enhancer B (inverted
CCAAT), CCAAT, and TATA elements [30]. Computationally predicted arrangements of conserved cis-elements in
the promoters of H2-K and its human ortholog, HLA-A,
are shown in Figure 2. FASTA sequences and corresponding coordinates of the regions used in the analysis are
given in Additional file 10. The predicted arrangements
are in close agreement with results of genomic footprint-

ing, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and other techniques. For HLA-A, computationally identified binding
sites previously found by biochemical analyses include:
IRFF, CREB, ECAT, PCAT, TBPF and two NFKB. The
enhancer-A element of the MHC class I promoter encompasses two NFKB binding sites and plays an important
role in the constitutive and cytokine-induced expression
of MHC class I genes. Our IRFF site is the reported ISRE
and can bind interferon regulatory factor 1 to activate
MHC class I transcription. Site α of the MHC Class I
promoter corresponds to our CREB binding site and plays
an important role in regulation of expression of Class I

genes. Our PCAT and ECAT sites include sequences consistent with the CCAAT site and our TBPF is a TATA binding site, as reported in the MHC class I promoter
immediately upstream of the transcription start site [30].
Computational analysis identifies additional potential
binding sites that have not yet been tested for biological
relevance. These include families IKRS, WHZF, EKLF,
EGRF, and AHRR. Several of these may play a specific role
in the immune system. For instance, the IKRS family of
sites bind Ikaros zinc finger transcription factors, which
are regulators of lymphocyte differentiation; the WHZ
family of TFs includes members that are critical to the
proper expression of genes during development of the
thymus [31]; the EGR family of zinc finger transcription
factors is induced as a consequence of activation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway during positive selection in the thymus [32]; and AhR
is known to effect immunosuppression by inducing bone
marrow stromal cells to deliver a death signal to lymphocytes [33]. We conclude that computational analyses
both identify previously reported TF binding sites and predict phylogenetically conserved sites that should be examined for biological relevance in future biochemical
studies.
Cis-Regulatory elements in genes grouped by patterns of
expression
Locally developed programs, TraFaC and CisMols, were
used to identify and display putative regulatory modules
in genes grouped by patterns of expression. The algorithms use a moving 200 bp window to scan regions of
DNA for specific sequences characteristic of TF binding
sites (Figure 3).

Cluster analysis of genome wide expression data from
microarrays permits the grouping together of genes with
similar patterns of expression across cells, tissues or experimental conditions. Clustering of genes by patterns of
expression was first applied on a large scale to yeast [34],
where control of important variables like genotype, phase
of cell cycle, and growth conditions permits precise identification of coordinately regulated genes. Clustering has
also been used to catalog mammalian genes that are differentially expressed in normal and malignant immune
cells [35,36]. While yeast genes with similar patterns of
expression have been found to share regulatory elements
[37], identification of such elements in clustered genes of
mammals is complex and not very successful [38,39].
Conservation of functionally important regions of DNA
underpins current methods of identifying putative regulatory regions by computational analysis of nucleotide
sequences [14-16]. Using K-means clustering in GeneSpring (Version 4.2.1), 160 genes, which had been annotated using SOURCE [40] early in our studies, were
divided into distinct sets based on similarity of expression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/82

patterns across 15 tissues. Tissues were given equal weight,
the number of clusters was set at 20, and similarity was
measured by standard correlation. For technical reasons,
GeneSpring did not assign 4 genes to clusters. The cluster
sets are shown in Additional file 2.
K-cluster set 15
K-cluster set 15 contained 14 genes. While these genes had
similarities in patterns of expression across a group of 15
tissues, their most prominent shared characteristic was
preferential expression in thymus. They were diverse in
function. For instance, the group comprised transcription
factors Ets1 and Tcf12, chromatin matrix associated protein Smarcf1 (recently renamed Arid1a), the ATP-binding
cassette transporter Abcg1 (transports peptides during
antigen processing), the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase
Oasl2 that is induced by interferon, and the histocompatibility antigen H2-K that plays a role in antigen presentation and processing. Sequences of both the mouse gene
and its human ortholog were available for seven genes
(Abcg1, Ctsl, Man2b1, Sgpl1, Arid1a, Tcf12, and Zfp162).
The 3 kb upstream regions of all 7 genes were compared
to identify modules of shared cis-elements. The search criteria were limited by (1) requiring modules to contain at
least 3 TF binding sites, one of which is a lymphoid element (see this list of lymphoid elements in Methods), (2)
to be evolutionarily conserved, that is, to occur within the
phylogenetic footprints in the aligned mouse-human
orthologs, and (3) to be located within 3 kb upstream and
100 bp downstream of the first bp of exon 1 (transcription
start). Examples of modules of cis-elements are shown in
Table 2. Arid1a, Abcg1 and Sgpl1 are most similar to one
another. They also have the most similar patterns of
expression across tissues, when clustered in hierarchical
trees. One module, AP2F EGRF MAZF SP1F ZBPF, contains 5 cis-elements within a 200 bp window and is
present within 3 kb upstream of transcription start in
Arid1a, Abcg1 and Sgpl1. The conserved modules containing multiple transcription factor binding sites (Table 2
and Figures 3 and 4; Additional file 11 gives fasta
sequences, list of binding sites and coordinates) are likely
to play a role in regulation of expression of these genes,
but this hypothesis must be experimentally verified. Ctsl,
Man2b1, Zfp162 and Tcf12 did not share modules (within
upstream 3 kb region and having at least one "lymphoid
element") with the other genes.

Figure 4 shows the computationally predicted arrangement of cis-elements immediately upstream of the transcription start site (promoters) of specific individual
genes: Arid1a, Abcg1, and Zfp162. Elements were required
to be within 500 bp of transcription start to be shown in
Figure 4, which focuses on sequence conservation in
classical promoters of pairs of orthologs and does not
require that elements be shared with other genes. Modules

Figure 3of a CisMols display of location and composition of clusters of cis-elements that are putative regulatory modules
Example
Example of a CisMols display of location and composition of clusters of cis-elements that are putative regulatory modules. The genes are those with high expression in thymus. The algorithm used by TraFac and CisMols to display regulatory modules uses a moving 200 bp window to scan regions of DNA for specific sequences characteristic of TF binding sites
(cis-elements). Clusters of these cis-elements are not generally distributed evenly across a segment of DNA, but are highly
localized to specific segments which are likely to play a role in regulation of gene expression. Because the scanning window is
limited to 200 bp and the scan changes the frame of sequences within the window, a regulatory module that contains multiple
cis-elements may not be displayed as one list of multiple elements, but rather as a list of several modules of different composition and arrangement within one small segment of DNA. Each colored cube indicates a cluster of 3 or more cis-elements with
at least one "lymphoid element". The region searched is upstream 3 kb and downstream 100 bp of transcription start site (as
defined by the respective mRNAs from NCBI's RefSeq database). The legend in the lower left half indicates the composition of
each of the modules and the genes that share them. In the lower right hand panel is the Trafac image of one of the cis-element
dense region with multiple shared modules of Arid1a gene.

in Table 2 were within 3 kb of transcription start, which
could include both classical promoters and upstream
enhancers, and were shared by more than one pair of
orthologs. A number of the elements of modules listed in
Table 2 are also present in the predicted promoters. For
example, MAZF and SP1F are also present in the promoters of Arid1a, Abcg1 and Zfp162.

K-cluster Set 7
K-Cluster set 7 includes 19 genes. As a group the genes
were better expressed in stimulated lymph nodes and activated T-cells than in the other tissues. Expression was
characteristically low in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and in other non-immune adult and fetal tissues.
Among the genes in set 7 are the integral surface mem-

regulators Irf5 and Icsbp1, the tyrosine kinases Hck, Stk10,
and Lyn that are a part of the intracellular signaling cascade, the mitogen activated protein kinases Map3k1 and
Map4k1 that participate in the very earliest steps of induction of new gene expression after lymphocytes are
exposed to antigen, and the ATP-binding cassette transporters Abca7 and Tap1 of the type that transport peptides
during antigen processing. Other less well-characterized
genes in these sets may have functions similar to the genes
that are better annotated. Sequences of 11 genes from Set
7 and their human orthologs were examined for the presence of clusters of TF binding sites, at least one of which is
a lymphoid element, as defined in Methods. The 11 genes
shared relatively few clusters of TF binding sites. There
were 7 clusters shared by 3 genes. The largest cluster contained 6 elements, AP2F CDEF EGRF SP1F ZBPF ZF5F and
was shared by Irf5 and Stk10. There were 21 clusters
shared by 2 genes and containing 3 to 6 TF binding sites.
The composition and location of these are shown in
images from CisMols (Additional files 3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9).
Highly expressed genes
In addition to searching for potential regulatory regions
within sets of genes clustered by similarities of patterns of
expression across sets of tissues and within regions immediately upstream of exon 1, we also sought to identify
genes characterized by high expression in specific
immune tissues. It is not known whether clustering by
pattern of expression across tissues and/or grouping by
high expression in specific tissues (or neither) will be a
useful way to group genes for computational identifica-

tion of regulatory elements and regulatory regions. It is
clear, however, that although modules of cis-elements that
regulate expression of genes in tissues can occur at many
different locations relative to a gene's promoter, at least
some regulatory elements are located within promoter
regions and this is the region we have searched most
intensively for conservation of known TF binding sites.
For the purposes of this analysis, we defined genes that
were highly expressed based on their normalized expression being at least 4 times higher in an individual
immune tissue relative to their median signal across the
entire database. High expression in a single tissue does
not preclude significant expression in other tissues, so
high expression is not synonymous with unique expression. We examined highly expressed mouse genes and
their human orthologs for the presence of clusters of TF
binding sites, with the additional constraint that at least
one of the cis elements present in the cluster was a lymphoid element, as defined in Methods. Grouped by tissue,
suitable paired mouse/human orthologs were: activated
T-cells, 17 genes: Ctsz, Kpnb1, Tnfrsf9, Tnfrsf4, Myc, Mcm2,
Mcm5, Mcm6, Mcm7, Gzmb, Ncf4, Gapd, Ccl4, Pcna, Rpl13,

Aldo1, Myog, Dmd, Chrm3) and 8 in liver (G6pc, Cyp7a1,

i.e. not tissues that play a critical role in lymphocyte differentiation or the immune response. The MCM family
and Myc are involved in replication of DNA and chromosomes. The TNF and TNFR families of genes encode recepPage 9 of 16

Each of the colored bars represents a class of TF binding sites and connects homologous binding sites in genes of the two species. The orthologous genes may differ in the number and location of
specific TF's binding sites. The corresponding coordinates of the regions on human (NCBI Build 35, May 2004) genome assembly are: chr1: 26,706,590–26,706,986 (+), chr21: 42,512,113 42,512,317 (+) and chr11: 64,302,720–64,302,924 (-) for human

tors and ligands that couple directly to signaling pathways
for cell proliferation, survival and differentiation [41].
Prss16 encodes a thymus specific protease which is specifically expressed by epithelial cells in the thymic cortex and
plays a role in T-cell development and, perhaps, in susceptibility to autoimmunity [42]. Hdac7a encodes a histone
deacetylase. Members of the Hdac family of genes modify
histones and play a role in the regulation of expression of
genes such as those functioning in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and transcription [43]. Cxcl9 is an inflammatory
chemokine induced by interferon. Its promoter contains
binding sites for CREB, STAT1, and NFKB [44].

The results of the above approach are shown in Table 3,
which lists examples of putative computationally identified regulatory modules of immune genes and the cis-elements that they contain. When modules of genes highly
expressed in thymus, stimulated lymph nodes, or activated T-cells were compared with one another and to
modules of genes expressed in muscle and liver, it is clear
that the composition (cis-elements) of modules are not
unique to a specific gene. However there is some evidence
of unique arrangements of elements within modules.
There are also cis-elements that are not commonly shared.
For example, the individual cis-elements HESF, HAML,
MYT1 and P53F were not found in modules of genes other
than those highly expressed in thymus. Likewise, E2FF

E2FF is found in promoters of Mcm2, Mcm5, Mcm6,

Regulatory modules, which have been proved biologically
to regulate expression of genes, contain multiple TF
binding sites, much as is shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4.

Discussion
Individual differentiated biological states can be characterized by gene expression profiling. Large-scale comparisons of profiles of cells, tissues, and developmental stages
have the potential to identify a wealth of coordinately regulated groups of genes that reflect the interplay of their
functional relationships and transcriptional control
mechanisms. We have built a database comprised of the

mRNA expression profiles of 65 normal adult and fetal
C57BL/6J mouse tissues using the Incyte Mouse GEM1,
8638 element, clone set. Using microarray analysis, 680
sequences were identified that were highly expressed in
one or more of 6 immune tissues. Many were also
expressed in certain other tissues. Some of these other tissues were organs such as heart, kidney, and brain which
do not normally contain lymphocytes in large numbers
and do not play a role in the immune response. Others,
such as intestine and lung, interface with the external
environment, contain significant numbers of lymphocytes, and can mount an immune response. The 680
expressed sequences were filtered to remove 320 that were
expressed in "non-immune" brain or heart or kidney. This
resulted in a list of 360 expressed sequences called
"immune genes" that were less broadly expressed in tissues without immune function than were the 680. Mutations and polymorphisms in both the 680 expressed
sequences and the 360 immune genes have a significant
chance of specifically affecting immune function. We predict this will be more common with changes in the 360
immune genes. We tested this by comparing reports of
disease causing mutations in the 360 immune genes with
those reported for the 320 genes that were more broadly
expressed (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). Of the
360 mouse immune genes, 32 had an ortholog with gene
symbol in OMIM and17 had annotations that described a
function clearly linked to development or function of the
immune system. Mutations in 2 (LCP2 and PARVG) cause
severe immunodeficiency disease. Examples of other diseases caused by mutations in these 32 genes were B- and
T-cell malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and reduced
viral or bacterial resistance. Of the 320 genes removed
from the list of 680, 37 had orthologs with gene symbols

listed in OMIM. 4 genes were expressed in lymphocytes
and mutation in one, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, causes
agammaglobulinemia. Mutations in other genes caused
disorders of coagulation, red cells, or granulocytes, rather
than the immune system. We conclude that the list of 360
immune genes includes a higher percentage of genes preferentially expressed in immunocompetent tissues and
with more specific immune-related functions than does
the full list of 680 sequences expressed in immune tissues,
but also with expression in non-immune tissues.
The 360 immune genes represent a portion of the complete set of genes that encode proteins and processes necessary for the differentiation, maintenance, and function
of the immune system. These genes are functionally
diverse and represent both ubiquitous and specialized cellular processes. 10 or more genes are in specific functional
clusters that carry out general processes such as DNA and
chromosomal replication, cell cycle regulation, transcription, and translation. Other genes are in functional clusters that carry out specialized functions, largely restricted
to immune tissues. These include genes that encode proteins involved in antigen recognition and transport,
chemokine synthesis, chemokine recognition, and the
intracellular signaling cascade necessary to initiate transcription and new protein synthesis in lymphocytes, as
part of the host response to antigen. Functional annotation of these genes is a work in progress. While probable
functions have been assigned to most of the expressed
sequences and the genes that encode them, using information shown in the Additional file 1, there is much work
to be done. Most functional annotations are based on the
sharing of presently known protein domains and
sequence homologies and provide general clues to the
role a gene or protein may play in cells that participate in
the immune response to antigen. A more precise understanding will come about as new laboratory data are correlated with studies of the expression of specific immune
genes, their coordination with expression of other genes,
and the structure and function of their products.
For several reasons, the "immune genes" that we have
identified are not all of the genes that are expressed in
immune tissues: (1) the Incyte set of 8638 genes probably
contains representative cDNAs from 25% or less of all
mouse genes; (2) genes that are essential to immune
function, but are expressed at similar levels in immune
and other tissues will not be included in the immune set;
and (3) a gene with a very low level of expression will be
missed, if cDNA made from its RNA is not present in sufficient quantity to give a signal on the microarray. Genes
may be included or excluded in error because of the large
number of genes screened for expression with a limited
number of replicates. Incyte cDNA microarrays are no
longer manufactured and no Incyte arrays or public data-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/82

bases are available to check expression of our immune
genes in other species. There are two relevant publicly
available Novartis gene expression databases (Genomics
Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, [18]),
which can be accessed. One uses Affymetrix chip U74Av2
and a set of 90 mouse tissues and cell lines and the second
uses Affymetrix HG U133 and 158 human tissues and
cells. Relating Affymetrix probes to Incyte cDNA probes is
complex and the Novartis tissue sets do not contain the
same tissues we have used. However, our immune genes,
when expressed on the Novartis arrays, are generally
clustered in tissues of the immunohematopoietic system,
the gastrointestinal tract, and lung. These types of publicly
available databases will permit identification and functional annotation of new immune genes with consequent
availability of larger sets of coordinately regulated genes
for searches of conserved regulatory modules.
Using comparative genomics-based, cis-element analyses
and
http://genometra
(http://trafac.cchmc.org[15]
fac.cchmc.org[46]), we identified compositionally similar
clusters of cis-elements in upstream regions of mouse/
human orthologs of several immune genes. There was an
excellent agreement between the computationally predicted and experimentally determined arrangements of
cis-elements in the promoters of the mouse H2-K and
human HLA-A genes. Analyses of other immune genes
identified a wealth of potential immune system-specific
regulatory modules. For example (Table 2), Arid1a, Abcg1,
and Sgpl1 are members of a K-clustered set of immune
genes and share a phylogenetically conserved module of 5
cis-elements: AP2F EGRF MAZF SP1F and ZBPF, all within
a 200 bp interval. Other examples of clustered TF binding
sites that could be within regulatory modules of genes
highly expressed in specific tissues are given in RESULTS.
Striking examples of putative modules include the 6 ciselement module AP2F EGRF HESF MAZF SP1F ZBPF in
genes highly expressed in thymus; the 6 cis-element module E2FF EBOX ETSF MAZF SP1F ZFSF in genes highly
expressed in activated T-cells; and the 6 element module
AP2F CDEF EGRF SP1F ZBPF ZF5F in genes highly
expressed in stimulated lymph nodes (Table 3). Putative
regulatory modules are not distributed randomly across
an entire segment of DNA, but are highly clustered within
distinct short segments that are the computationally identified promoters and enhancers (Figure 3). Because of the
nature of the scanning algorithm with its 200 bp window,
variations of multiple modules may occur within one segment. These phenomena are more easily understood by
examining Figure 3. Our data support the hypothesis that
(1) regulatory modules of genes are highly clustered in a
few sites that can be computationally identified, (2) modules in different genes may share cis-elements that bind
TFs, and (3) certain combinations of TF binding sites are
phylogenetically conserved and appear to be reused across

genes when specific patterns of expression are required.
Cis-elements from the same family have a high probability of interacting with similar groups of transcription factors, although they will not necessarily be in the same
position relative to the transcription start site. We have
identified genes and putative regulatory modules that play
a role in the differentiation, maintenance, and function of
the immune system. These results serve to advance both
our understanding of normal gene and immune system
function and also to identify genes and regulatory regions
whose mutation or polymorphic variation lead to immunologic disease.

Methods
C57BL/6J mice from The Jackson Laboratory were the
source of normal adult and fetal tissues. The complete
panel of tissues for microarray analyses by our group has
been described [47]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
were separated from whole blood on Ficoll/Hypaque gradients; unstimulated lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus
were each collected from unimmunized mice and pooled
separately; "stimulated" lymph nodes were collected from
mice 10 days after they were immunized with hen eggwhite lysozyme (HEL) in complete Freund's adjuvant;
activated T cells were prepared by enriching T cells from
peripheral blood and treating them with anti-CD3 and
anti-CD28. Except for activated T-cells and pancreatic islet
cells, all cells and tissues were collected in duplicate. 128
preparations of poly (A)-RNA were made from 65 different tissues, checked for quality, and quantified as previously described [19,47].
Microarray analyses were carried out using Incyte mouse
GEM1 cDNA arrays (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA), as
described previously for our group [19,47]. Relative abundance of probes was calculated as the ratio of the sample
value against the value from the labeled whole mouse reference cDNA for each gene on each array. Data analyses
were carried out with GeneSpring version 4.2.1 (Silicon
Genetics) software, including filtering, K-means and hierarchical clustering. A list of all tissues in the full set of 65
normal adult and fetal tissues is provided in Additional
file 12. Our analyses focused on comparison gene expression in 18 tissues that were selected to represent a variety
of adult and fetal tissues (Figure 1B), most with immunological function. 6 of the 18 tissues were the "immune
tissues" – unstimulated and stimulated lymph nodes,
spleen, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, activated Tcells, and thymus. The remaining 12 tissues of the 18 tissue set were: fetal day 16.5 intestine and lung; adult duodenum, jejunum, ileum, proximal and distal colon; adult
lung and liver, and joint synovium from normal adult
mice and mice with acute and chronic arthritis. All pertinent microarray data are available through the Children's
Hospital Research Foundation expression database web

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/82

server http://genet.chmcc.org within the ExpressionDB
folders of the Incyte Mouse GEM1 chip genome.
Genes on the Incyte array were identified by NCBI GenBank accession and systematic numbers and by gene symbol, where available. For those sequences that could not
be assigned a gene symbol, sequence homologies to
known mouse genes were sought using MouseBLAST [23],
BLAT [12], MGD [23], and LocusLink [24]. BLAST comparisons of the human and mouse confirmed Ensembl
predictions of human orthologs of mouse genes. Identity
of genes was confirmed by BLAST comparison of the GenBank
sequences
from
NCBI
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[48] with Ensembl [13] sequences.
When downloading the genomic sequences with flanking
sequences, it was important to have an mRNA that contained exon 1, so the site of initiation of transcription was
correctly identified. Presence of an upstream exon 1 in an
isoform would lead to re-defining of the promoter and
intronic regions. Criteria for presence of exon 1 included:
comparison of the number and location of exons in
orthologous genes, alignment of transcripts of the gene as
reported by different databases, and alignment of the 5'
end of the transcript with the putative start site and signals
in the gene. In cases where we encountered multiple high
scoring transcript hits against the genome, we manually
looked into the alignments to rule out the occurrence of
pseudogenes that frequently lacked introns when compared to the "true" genes. Additional information about
sequences of both the transcript and the gene was
obtained from UCSC Golden Path [12]. Confirmation of
the presence of exon 1 in orthologs was particularly
important because of the need to locate the start site of
transcription. Computational prediction of exons is error
prone. DNA sequences of genes were downloaded to
include at least 10,000 flanking base pairs upstream and
downstream of the first and last exons respectively. The
November 2002 and April 2003 assemblies of human and
the February 2002 and February 2003 assemblies of
mouse genome were used for this purpose depending
upon their availability at the time of our analyses (Additional files 10 and 11 list relevant FASTA sequences and
genomic coordinates).
The GO and MGI databases were searched for annotations
of the immune genes, using Stanford SOURCE http://
source.stanford.edu[40]. For genes not found or incompletely annotated, manual annotation was done using criteria similar to the Gene Ontology (GO) [49], Mouse
Genome Informatics (MGI) [23], and LocusLink classifications http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink[50]. A
function was assigned if the encoded protein contained
distinctive InterPro functional domains, or sequence similarity to paralogs previously annotated, or sequence similarity to functionally characterized SwissProt/TrEMBL

proteins. Using the information about structure and function, the authors simplified annotations and grouped
genes by major functions, such as antigen binding and
processing (defense – immune function), transcription,
protein synthesis, apoptosis, cell division. Highly detailed
annotations are provided in the supplementary materials
(Additional file 1).
To identify putative consensus cis-acting regulatory
sequences in genes that were coordinately regulated, we
first selected groups of genes based on their expression
patterns in different immune tissues. The complete
genomic sequences (with flanking upstream and downstream regions of 40 kb) of the selected genes and their
orthologs were extracted from the Ensembl/UCSC human
and mouse databases [12,13]. Where available the NCBIRefSeq mRNAs were used as references for downloading
the genomic sequences with upstream and downstream
gene flanking regions of 40 kb. The transcription start site
was thus at 40,000 in the downloaded sequences used in
comparative genomic analysis for identification of potential regulatory clusters using Trafac server [15]. Repeat elements were masked using the RepeatMasker http://
ftp.genome.washington.edu[51]. Conserved clusters of
regulatory elements in the evolutionarily conserved noncoding regions of mouse and human orthologs were displayed using the TraFaC http://trafac.cchmc.org[15] or
GenomeTraFaC http://genometrafac.cchmc.org[46] servers which integrate results from MatInspector Professional
(Version 4.1, 2004; 356 individual matrices in 138 families) http://www.genomatix.de[52] and Advanced PipMaker (chaining option) http://pipmaker.bx.psu.edu/cgibin/pipmaker?advanced[53] programs. We compared
conserved putative cis-regulatory regions of each of the
different groups of genes from mouse and human to identify known TF binding sites. The CisMols analyzer http://
cismols.cchmc.org[22] permits selection of TFs that must
be present in clusters of TFs that constitute a putative regulatory module. To convey specificity to the search for
modules relevant to regulation of gene expression in
immune tissues, we required the presence of one or more
of the following TFs, which we call "lymphoid elements".
They have been reported to play a role in some aspect of
lymphoid biology (see for example, [1-3]: BCL6, CMYB,
CREB, EGRF, ETSF, GATA, IKRS, IRFF, MZF1, NFAT,
NFKB, OCT1 (site also binds OCT2), PAX5, SP1F, VMYB,
and WHZF. ECAT and PCAT were also included because
of their frequent occurrence in promoters at the start of
transcription. The search was limited to a region 3 kb
upstream and 100 bp downstream of the start site of exon
1 (based on the NCBI-RefSeq mRNA annotations). This is
where the promoter and associated regulatory elements
would be expected, given that additional regulatory elements (enhancers/silencers) are almost certain to be
located elsewhere. Images of the CisMols analyses of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/82

genes to identify regulatory elements are also provided in
supplementary materials (Additional files 3 to 9). One
example is shown in Figure 3.
