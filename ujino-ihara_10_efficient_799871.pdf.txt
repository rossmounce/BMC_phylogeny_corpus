based on EST data combined with high
resolution melting (HRM) analysis

Abstract
Background: In order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) efficiently from a species with a large
genome, SNPs were identified from an expressed sequence tag (EST) database combined with High Resolution
Melting (HRM) analysis.
Findings: A total of 574 sequence tagged sites (STSs) were generated from Cryptomeria japonica and HRM analysis
was used to screen for polymorphisms in these STS markers. STSs were designed in two ways: 1) putative SNP sites
were identified by comparing ESTs from specific contigs, then 226 primer pairs designed for the purpose to
amplify these SNPs; 2) 348 primer pairs were randomly designed using reads from the 3’ end of cDNA. HRM
analysis revealed that 325 markers among eight individuals were polymorphic, and that STSs, including putative
SNP sites, exhibited higher levels of polymorphism.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that the combination of SNP screening from an EST database combined with
HRM analysis is a highly efficient way to develop SNP markers for expressed genes. This method will contribute to
both genetic mapping and the identification of SNPs in non-model organisms.

Background
Sugi, Cryptomeria japonica, is one of the most important commercial tree species in Japan. Recently, linkage
maps have been constructed for this species, based on
co-dominant markers including RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), CAPS (Cleaved Amplified
Polymorphic Sequences), and SSR (Simple Sequence
Repeat) markers [1-3]. Although these linkage maps
include hundreds of markers, more DNA markers are
required to generate a denser linkage map. Furthermore,
some markers do not segregate in all crosses, thus
increasing the number of markers can greatly enhance
the scope and resolution of QTL analyses using the progenies of controlled crosses.
C. japonica has large genome (~10100 Mbp) [4],
therefore full genomic sequences have not been
obtained. On the other hand, because of the importance
of this species to Japanese forestry, expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) have been generated using several types of

tissues from several individuals [5-7]. Redundant
sequences found in EST databases can be a useful
resource for mining SNPs or developing DNA markers,
since mapping expressed genes to a linkage map makes
the map more useful for QTL analysis or MarkerAssisted Selection (MAS). The discovery of SNPs in
ESTs has been conducted for several species using programs such as PolyBayes [8] and QualitySNP [9]. We
used QualitySNP in our study because it allowed us to
consider both paralogous genes and sequence errors
without having a sequence quality file and reference
sequences.
After mining putative SNPs from a database, methods
to identify STS polymorphisms are required. HRM analysis is an efficient SNP detection method that identifies
differences in the shapes of melting curves between different genotypes using an intercalating dye that binds to
the double-stranded DNA [10]. In short, the melting
curve changes its shape due to mismatches in heteroduplexes or variation of nucleotides in homoduplexes that
exist in the post-PCR mixture. HRM analysis has considerable advantages over other SNP detection methods

because it only requires PCR products stained with specific dyes. As a result of these advantages, HRM analysis
has gained popularity and applied to not only mutation
screening of specific genes but genetic mapping in plant
species [11-13]. Using HRM, SNPs have been developed
in almond based on alignments of peach/almond ESTs
obtained from public database [14]. In this study, we
report an efficient way to develop a large number of
HRM markers for genetic mapping in non-model organisms by combining SNP mining from an EST database
with HRM analysis, using publicly available software.

Methods
Primer design

Primer design method is illustrated in Figure 1. EST
sequences of C. japonica were obtained from the NCBI
EST database. Putative contaminant DNA (from bacterial genomic DNA, cpDNA, and mtDNA) was excluded
on the basis of the results of BLAST analysis. Clusters

of ESTs were then identified by the CAP3 program; the
minimum length and percentage identity of overlap was
set to 100 and 95 respectively [15]. For the obtained
contigs, possible SNPs were screened using QualitySNP
with the default settings, except for the threshold of
over-all similarity between haplotypes, which was set to
0.9. The primers were designed for the predicted putative SNP target sites. Hereafter, these STSs are referred
to as ‘contig-STSs’. The primers were also randomly
designed from readings from the 3’ end of cDNA (3’ESTs) among the resultant singlet sequences, and these
were designated ‘singlet-STSs’. In both cases, possible
exon-intron boundaries were screened by the Spidey
program [16], by comparing the cDNA of C. japonica to
genomic sequences of Arabidopsis with option for interspecies alignment. Although C. japonica is phylogenetically distant from Arabidopsis, it was reported that
11.5% of ESTs derived from 5’-terminal sequences of
cDNAs exhibited significant similarities to gene coding
sequence of Arabidopsis at nucleotide sequence level
[7]. Any detected exon-intron boundaries were avoided
in designing primers. All primer pairs were designed
using Primer 3 [17] to amplify amplicons within the
range 90 bp-120 bp. The result obtained by Spidey and
QualitySNP were incorporated into input files for primer3 using perl scripts developed in-house.
Plant material

Polymorphisms of the STS markers were screened with
eight C. japonica individuals. Six of the individuals were
from natural populations, representing the species’ natural distribution in Japan: Yakushima, Shimowada, Ishinomaki, Oki, Ajigasawa, and Ashu. Two further sources
of parental material were used for mapping populations,
YI38 and YI96. These two samples were derived from a
local cultivar on Kyushu-island. Since SNP markers
detected by QualitySNP may include spurious markers
(because paralogous sequences may be assembled in a
contig), but those that segregate in an expected manner
are likely to be true SNPs, the validity of the HRM markers was tested by segregation analysis using the progeny of YI38 and YI96. DNA of all plant material was
extracted using a modified CTAB method [18].
High Resolution Melting Analysis

PCR amplification was performed in 10 μl reaction
volumes containing 200 μM of each dNTP, 0.8 units of
GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Co. Ltd.), 1 × buffer provided for the GXL DNA polymerase that contained 1.0
mM MgCl2, 0.2 μM of each primer, 0.5 ul DMSO, 0.5 ul
of EvaGreen, and 5 ng of template DNA (Fukuoka et al.,
personal communication). The PCR amplification was carried out for 10 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 40
sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 60°C, and 15 sec at 72°C. High

resolution Melting Analysis was carried out using a Lightcycler 480 (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. If the amplification product yield was low, we
decreased the PCR annealing temperature to 56°C.

Results and Discussion
SNP discovery and the development of STS markers

A total of 55634 ESTs of Cryptomeria japonica were
available on the NCBI EST database. After removing
possible organelle and bacterial genes, 55530 ESTs were
assembled into 10368 contigs and 13783 singlets. In the
QualitySNP analysis, contigs with at least four ESTs
were considered for SNP screening. Of the 10368 contigs, 3809 (3310919 bp) were screened and 1246 SNPs
with high confidence were found in 314 contigs (8.2% of
the total number of contigs screened). The overall SNP
frequency was one SNP per 2657.2 bp for the 3809
screened contigs.
In the case of maritime pine [19], SNPs were also surveyed from EST data using Phred [20,21], Phrap http://
www.phrap.org, and PolyBayes. SNP abundance was estimated as one SNP per 660 bp in a set of 940 contigs
representing 942216 bp. A similar study was also carried
out for white spruce, and 12264 SNPs were found when
6459 contigs of at least two cDNA clones were surveyed
with Polybayes [22]. These authors estimated an overall
frequency of one SNP per 700 nucleotide sites. Compared
to previous studies, the proportion of contigs with a putative SNP site and the SNP frequency in C. japonica
appears to be much lower. This may be the result of the

different software used, the numbers of ESTs screened, or
the number of individuals (or varieties) examined in the
EST database. In our study, parameters used in EST clustering and SNP detection were severe to avoid assembling
paralogous sequences into contigs; this may have also
affected the SNP discovery rate.
The predicted SNP distribution was uneven and there
was high variation in SNP frequency among the 314 contigs, ranging from one SNP every 3.6 bp to 1967 bp (Figure 2). In a study of the DNA variation in C. japonica, the
frequency of segregation sites occurring in transcribed
regions ranged from one segregation site every 89.79 bp to
1047 bp [23]. SNP frequency was also estimated in maritime pine and one SNP was found every 102.6 bp [19].
Considering these SNP frequencies, D-values from QualitySNP (which indicate the probability of paralogous genes
being present in a cluster), and polynucleotide sequences
(which often cause repeat number errors at the beginning
or end of a read), 55 contigs were excluded from primer
design after manual inspection of the assemblage. Consequently, a total of 259 primer pairs were designed from
the 314 putative SNPs (contig-STS).
For comparison, 412 primer pairs were also randomly
designed from 3’ ESTs (singlet-STS). These primer pairs
were designed from 3’ ESTs because previous studies
have suggested that STSs derived from 3’ ESTs are
more polymorphic than STSs derived from 5’ ESTs [24].
As a consequence, 226 and 348 STSs were successfully
amplified from contig-STS and singlet-STS, respectively
(Table 1). Single fragments were obtained for most

primer pairs because the amplicons were designed to
amplify short fragments (90-120 bp); it was also an
advantage of HRM markers.
Detection of nucleotide differences for STSs by HRM
analysis

Obtained STSs were then analyzed by HRM analysis.
One-hundred and seventy-three of the 226 STSs from the
contig-STSs (76.5%) were polymorphic among the eight
individuals used in this study (Figure 3); this was a much
higher efficiency than obtained by randomly designed primers from singlet-STSs, as 43.9% of them were polymorphic (Table 1). Segregation of 148 STSs that
segregated between YI38 and YI96 were also tested using

F2 progeny of them. The results revealed that 128 of the
148 STSs (86.5%) exhibited the expected segregation from
parental genotypes (data not shown), thus detected polymorphisms are unlikely to have resulted from nucleotide
differences in paralogous genes. Higher polymorphism in
the contig-STSs and the segregation in expected manner
of those HRM markers indicated that QualitySNP detected
actual SNPs in the transcribed region.
When SNPs were screened by CAPS analysis, 72.3% of
STSs were polymorphic [2]. The detection efficiency of
CAPS is comparable to that of HRM analysis of contigSTSs, however 15 individuals were screened using 24 or
36 endonucleases in the CAPS analysis. The screening of
CAPS markers takes more time and labor. In the SSCP
analysis, 37.3% of tested STSs were polymorphic among
10 individuals with 12 different electrophoresis conditions
[24]. Therefore, if the SNP frequency was similar in both
cases, HRM analysis is likely to be more sensitive than
SSCP analysis. As described above, HRM analysis shows
higher sensitivity even when they were analyzed under one

individuals described in Materials and Methods were shown. a. sugiHRM300 showing four different profiles, b. sugiHRM378 showing two
different profiles. Both amplicons included SNP site predicted by QualitySNP from EST data (G/A for sugiHRM300 and T/A for sugiHRM378).
Genotypes for each profile were not indicated because they were not validated by sequencing. Both HRM markers segregated in expected
manner in F2 progeny of YI38 and YI96.

experimental condition. Therefore HRM analysis is a more
efficient way to detect SNPs in terms of the sensitivity,
cost, time and labor in genomic mapping of non-model
organisms. Changing experimental condition will further
improve the detection efficiency. It is important to note
that the panel individuals and individuals used in the
cDNA library construction were not same. The absence of
polymorphism in the HRM analysis was sometimes unrelated to the sensitivity of the technique, but due to the
absence of the predicted SNPs in panel DNA.

Conclusions
We demonstrated here that using HRM analysis for converting expressed sequences to DNA markers is very useful for genetic mapping. Although there are SNP typing
methods that have higher throughput than HRM analysis,
HRM analysis can be alternative method for moderate
scale genome project in aspects of time and cost. The
method described here used mainly publicly available
resources, therefore it is easily applicable to non-model
organisms with large genome size, such as C. japonica.
