Abstract
Background: Plexins are a large family of transmembrane receptors for the Semaphorins, known for their role in the
assembly of neural circuitry. More recently, Plexins have been implicated in diverse biological functions, including vascular
growth, epithelial tissue morphogenesis and tumour development. In particular, PlexinB1, the receptor for Sema4D, has
been suggested to play a role in neural development and in tumour angiogenesis, based on in vitro studies. However, the
tissue distribution of PlexinB1 has not been extensively studied and the functional relevance of this receptor in vivo still
awaits experimental testing. In order to shed light on PlexinB1 function in vivo, we therefore undertook the genomic
targeting of the mouse gene to obtain loss of function mutants.
Results: This study shows that PlexinB1 receptor and its putative ligand, Sema4D, have a selective distribution in nervous
and epithelial tissues during development and in the adult. PlexinB1 and Sema4D show largely complementary cell
distribution in tissues, consistent with the idea that PlexinB1 acts as the receptor for Sema4D in vivo. Interestingly,
PlexinB1 is also expressed in certain tissues in the absence of Sema4D, suggesting Sema4D independent activities. High
expression of PlexinB1 was found in lung, kidney, liver and cerebellum.
Mutant mice lacking expression of semaphorin receptor PlexinB1 are viable and fertile. Although the axon collapsing
activity of Sema4D is impaired in PlexinB1 deficient neurons, we could not detect major defects in development, or in
adult histology and basic functional parameters of tissues expressing PlexinB1. Moreover, in the absence of PlexinB1 the
angiogenic response induced by orthotopically implanted tumours was not affected, suggesting that the expression of this
semaphorin receptor in endothelial cells is redundant.
Conclusion: Our expression analysis suggests a multifaceted role of PlexinB1 during mouse development and tissue
homeostasis in the adult. Nonetheless, the genetic deletion of PlexinB1 does not result in major developmental defects
or clear functional abnormalities. We infer that PlexinB1 plays a redundant role in mouse development and it is not
strictly required for tumour induced angiogenesis.

Background

Results

Plexins are a highly conserved family of single pass transmembrane receptors which, in mammals, comprises nine
genes grouped into four subfamilies (A thru D) based on
sequence homology [1]. They are characterized by a conserved sequence, the "sema domain", a structural domain
that mediates protein-protein interaction, and phylogenetically links the Plexins to the Semaphorins and the
Scatter Factor Receptors [2]. The intracellular domain is
highly conserved among the Plexins but does not share
striking homology with other known proteins. Although
the mechanisms of Plexin-mediated signalling have not
been well understood, they are known to impinge on
cytoskeletal dynamics and on cell adhesion, e.g. by regulating monomeric GTPases of Rho and Ras families [3].

PlexinB1 and Sema4D expression during embryo
development and in the adult
In order to get insights to their physiological function, we
investigated the tissue distributions of PlexinB1 and
Sema4D in embryonic and adult tissues. Initially, we
explored PlexinB1 mRNA expression by Dot Blot analysis
of human tissue (Figure 1A) and by whole mount In Situ
Hybridization of mouse embryos (Additional file 1).
Taken together, these data revealed a wide expression of
PlexinB1 in various tissues, including nervous system,
lung, kidney and liver.

The immunohistochemical analysis of PlexinB1 and
Sema4D expression revealed an intriguing distribution in
developing organs characterized by epithelial branching
morphogenesis, including the kidney, the lung and the
pancreas. During epithelial branching morphogenesis, tissues are shaped by the outgrowth and branching of tubular epithelial structures, which invade the surrounding
mesenchyme under the control of growth factors and

In spite of extensive studies performed on Plexins of A
subfamily, molecular genetic studies to address the functional relevance in vivo of Plexins-B are currently lacking.
Here we report our analysis of PlexinB1 deficient mice,
including functional studies to test the relevance of this
semaphorin receptor in tumour induced angiogenesis.

It was also demonstrated that PlexinB1 can mediate axon
outgrowth [15] and endothelial cell migration [16]. In
addition, its ligand Sema4D is a potent angiogenetic factor [16,17], possibly involved in tumour induced angiogenesis [18].
PlexinB1 mRNA expression has previously been shown in
the nervous system [19] and in diverse tissues at E14 of
murine development [20]; on the other hand, detailed
information on the expression of Sema4D mRNA outside
the nervous system is missing. Notably, PlexinB1 and
Sema4D expression at protein level by immunohistochemistry has not been reported yet. Furthermore, little is
known about the expression of Sema4D and PlexinB1 in
the adult tissues.

Plexins were initially characterized for their role in axon
guidance, where they function, either alone or in complex
with the Neuropilins, as semaphorin receptors. Subsequently, Plexins were shown to control immune response
and angiogenesis, and more recently were proposed to
orchestrate tissue morphogenesis and cancer progression
[4]. We have previously identified PlexinB1 as the receptor
for Sema4D. Upon ligand binding, PlexinB1 regulates
cytoskeletal remodeling (via Rac [5,6], PDZ-RhoGEF [7],
p190 RhoGAP [8]), integrin activation (via R-Ras [9],
PI3K [10]), MAPK signalling [11], cytosolic tyrosine
kinases (Src, PYK2) [12], and can trigger the activation of
the tyrosine kinase receptors Met and ErbB-2 [13,14].

In order to gain further evidence of PlexinB1 expression at
the protein level, we generated specific anti-PlexinB1 antibodies (see Additional file 2 for specificity controls),
which we used to analyze further embryonic and adult tissues.

PlexinB1 expression in different human organs was assessed
by mRNA Dot Blot analysis. In the mouse embryo at E14
PlexinB1 is present in the mesenchimal cells of kidney (B) and
lung (D) while Sema4D displays a complementery expression
pattern in the epithelial cells of the same organs (C and E
respectively). F) At E17 PlexinB1 expression in the lung is
found in the mesenchymal cells positive for Smooth Muscle

guidance cues. We found that, at an early stage, PlexinB1
is expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding epithelial
tubules in kidney and lung (Figure 1B, D) and in the pancreas (not shown), while Sema4D is expressed by epithelial cells (Figure 1C, E).
The developmental expression of this ligand-receptor pair
appears to be dynamically regulated. For instance, in the
lung at E17, PlexinB1 was expressed in cells of putative
smooth muscle lineage recruited to wrap the differentiating airways (Figure 1F); conversely, in the adult, PlexinB1
expression was mostly localized to bronchial epithelium
(Figure 2A). Notably, while Sema4D expression was clear
in developing epithelia (Figure 1C), it was undetectable in
the adult lung (not shown).
In the adult kidney, we found an elevated expression of
PlexinB1 in distal tubules and collecting ducts (Figure
2B), while Sema4D displays a complementary expression
in the pars convoluta of proximal tubules (Figure 2C).
In the mouse liver, we could not clearly detect PlexinB1
expression during early embryonic stages (not shown),
though we found a high expression of PlexinB1 in adult
hepatocytes (Figure 2D). Surprisingly, we could not detect
Sema4D expression in the liver at any stage (not shown),
suggesting Sema4D-independent activities of PlexinB1 in
this tissue.

Consistent with previous reports [19], in the nervous system we detected PlexinB1 expression in sensory and
motor neurons, but were particularly attracted by the distinctive expression of PlexinB1 and Sema4D during cerebellar development. During postnatal development,
Purkinje cell (Pk) dendrites expand into the nascent
molecular layer, to form extensive connections with granule cell axons (parallel fibres). In the P10 cerebellum,
PlexinB1 is exclusively expressed in Purkinje cells, being
distributed in the perikaryon, dendritic tree and axon, up
to the terminal branches in the deep cerebellar nuclei (Figure 3A). At the same developmental stage it was shown
that Sema4D is expressed by myelinating oligodendrocytes in the folial white matter [21]. In the mature cerebellum PlexinB1 expression remains selectively confined to
PK cells. Moreover, labelling intensity of Pk axons now
reveals a clear cut rostro-caudal gradient, with higher levels of expression in the posterior cortical lobules (Figures
3B, C). In addition, analysis of frontal sections shows differential expression along parasagittally oriented Pk cell
subpopulations (Figure 3D). At this age, anti-Sema4D
antibodies show a diffuse distribution pattern in the
molecular layer, suggesting expression in parallel fibres
(Figure 3E).
Generation of PlexinB1 null mutant

vivo, we undertook the genomic targeting of the murine

generated a targeting construct in which we placed exon
22 and 23 of the PlexinB1 gene (encoding the transmembrane domain of the receptor) between two loxP sites
(Figure 4A). Furthermore, we inserted a Neo cassette,
flanked by two FRP sites and followed by a LacZ reporter
fused to the first exon of the intracellular portion of the
PlexinB1 gene; this allowed us, upon FLP recombination,
to also obtain knock-in PlexinB1 mutants. The correct targeting of the construct in the genome of ES cells was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Figure 4B). Chimeric
mice, obtained from a positive ES cell clone, were mated
with a CRE deleter strain to achieve gene inactivation, and
eventually backcrossed into C57BL/6 genetic background.
The actual deletion of exons 22 and 23 in mouse genome,
encoding for the transmembrane region of PlexinB1, was
confirmed by PCR analysis (Figure 4C).
By crossing heterozygous mice, we obtained PlexinB1
homozygous mutant mice, which were born and developed normally into adulthood. The genotypic analysis
revealed the expected Mendelian ratios in littermates
(Table 1). We confirmed the absence of PlexnB1 mRNA in
homozygous mutant by RT PCR analysis (Figure 4D).
Moreover, we analyzed tissue extracts of mutant and control mice by Western blotting by means of an antibody

directed to the intracellular domain of the receptor, and
confirmed that the expression of PlexinB1 was abrogated
in homozygous mutant mice at the protein level (Figure
4E).
PlexinB1 deficient mice do not display major
developmental defects
PlexinB1 mutant mice did not show any detectable difference in size and were undistinguishable from their wild
type (WT) littermates; in addition, their feeding behaviour
and weaning appeared to be regular, they developed normally and did not show defects in reproduction or fertility. Moreover, we measured some of the main blood
parameters (i.e. white blood cells counts, red blood cells
counts and values, haemoglobin concentration, platelet
count) and found them to be normal (data not shown).
Thus we undertook a histological analysis of embryonic
and adult tissues in PlexinB1 null mice.

the alveoli were properly inflated and the respiration
occurred normally in all the animals analyzed.
In the kidney PlexinB1 is highly expressed; however, the
histological analysis of mutant mice did not reveal any
gross defect or abnormality in tubules or nephrons (compare Figure 5B to 5E). These specialized structures develop
as the result of an intricate dialogue between the epithelial
cells and the surrounding mesenchyme, and these results
implicate that PlexinB1 is not essential during nephrogenic induction. Furthermore, the number of renal
glumeruli were counted and found to be similar in WT
and mutant mice (Figure 5G). Because significant defects
in kidney function may not implicate gross histological
abnormalities and because PlexinB1 is also expressed in
the adult, we performed blood tests on two major indicators of renal function, creatinine and urea levels, which
turned out to be comparable in normal and mutant mice
(see Tab. 2).
We furthermore examined the liver parenchyma, where
PlexinB1 is strongly expressed in WT mice. The haematoxylin/eosin staining revealed no sign of fibrosis, steatosis or
other particular abnormality in mutant mice (compare
Figure 5C to 5F). We performed blood tests to check two
major indicators of liver function: i.e. plasma concentration of fibrinogen and total proteins. In addition, we
measured blood levels of hepatic transaminases (glutamic
oxalacetic transaminase and glutamic piruvic transaminase), which are elevated in the presence of liver disorders, and we assessed the integrity of biliar tree by
measuring the blood levels of gamma-glutamil-transferase and alkaline phosphatase. None of these analyses
revealed significant differences between WT and mutant
mice (Table 2).

As mentioned above, we found the highest PlexinB1 protein expression in the central nervous system within the
cerebellum. However, in PlexinB1 null mice, the overall
cerebellar morphology of the cerebellum appeared normal and we could not reveal any abnormality in the foliation of lobuli or in the number of Pk cells (Figure 6A, E).
In the cerebellum, myelin formation starts from the first
postnatal week, in a period in which Sema4D is expressed
by the olygodendrocytes [21]. This prompted us to scrutinize the myelination process of Pk axons by means of confocal analysis. In fact, anti-myelin basic protein (MBP)
staining showed a correct wrapping of Pk axons by the
glial cells (Figures 6B, C, D, F, G, and 6H). In addition, Pk
axons were immunolabeled with anti-Calbindin (a major
Pk cells marker) in the mutant mice, revealing a normal
axon patterning. Furthermore, the collateral branching of
Pk axons in the infraganglionic plexus, which is normally
confined in the most superficial portion of the granular
layer [23], did not show any abnormality (see Figure 6B,
F). Also, the dendritic arborization of Pk cell in the molecular layer appeared normal in the mutant mice (not
shown). These data suggest that, although PlexinB1 is
abundantly expressed in Pk cells, its function doesn't
seem to be essential for proper development of cerebellar
Pk cells.
Axonal growth cones from PlexinB1 mutants fail to
collapse in response to Sema4D
We thought to exploit these mutants as a genetic tool to
investigate the functional requirement of PlexinB1 in
assays previously used to study Sema4D signalling. For
instance, it was demonstrated that the axonal growth
cones of cultured hippocampal neurons undergo collapse
in response to Sema4D in vitro, and it was proposed that
this response is mediated by PlexinB1 receptor [9]. We
observed that PlexinB1 is expressed by hippocampal neu-

rons, although at a lower level compared to Pk cells (not
shown); however, the evidence that PlexinB1 is responsible for the transduction of Sema4D repulsive signals in
these neurons is still lacking. Thus, to verify whether this
functional response is abrogated in PlexinB1 deficient
mice, hippocampal neurons derived from WT or mutant
mice were cultured for 48 hours ex vivo and then incubated with Sema4D for 1 hour. While the number of collapsed growth cones in wild type neurons was strongly
increased upon Sema4D stimulation, PlexinB1 -/- hippocampal neurons did not collapse and underwent normal
axonal outgrowth and differentiation, irrespective of
Sema4D treatment (Figure 7). This establishes a functional requirement for PlexinB1 in the repelling activity of
Sema4D in hippocampal neurons. We then examined the
overall histology and the cellular composition of the hippocampus in PlexinB1 knock-out mice. Moreover, we
analysed the cytoarchitectonic and the connection pattern
of hippocampal neurons (stained for Calbindin marker)
and interneurons (immunolabeled with anti-Parvalbumin antibody). However, we did not observe obvious
abnormalities of this neural structure in mutant mice (see
Additional file 3), consistent with a compensation of
Sema4D function in the development of the hippocampus.

carcinoma cells leads to reduction of tumour burden and
vascularity in a mouse xenograft model [18].
In fact, the so called "angiogenic switch", i.e. the ability of
tumour cells to recruit new vessels in order to provide
blood supply, is a basic step in solid tumour growth and
metastatic dissemination. Without overcoming this ratelimiting step, most tumours cannot grow over 2 mm in
diameter, nor metastasize. PlexinB1 is known to transduce Sema4D signals in vitro and it is expressed in
HUVEC endothelial cells and in the tumour vessels in vivo
[16-18], however its requirement in tumour angiogenesis
has not been clearly established.
We reasoned that, if PlexinB1 would play a major role in
this process, its ablation would impact on tumour angiogenesis, leading to reduced growth rate and metastatization of cancer cells. To test this, we exploited the well
established B16 melanoma model, which is syngenic with
the C57BL6 background of our mutants, and that we
found to produce Sema4D (see Additional file 4).
Melanoma cells were injected orthotopically in the subcute of WT, heterozygous and homozygous PlexinB1
mutant; tumour growth was followed over time, and
tumour explants were eventually weighted at the end of
the experiment after 25 days. We did not observe any significant difference between the slope of tumour growth
curve or in the final weight of the tumours grown in WT
or PlexinB1 null mice (Figure 8A, B). Moreover, we
counted the number of lung metastases formed by
tumours in normal and homozygous mutant mice and we
did not observe significative differences (Figure 8C).

melanoma cells were injected orthotopically in WT, heterozygous and homozygous PlexinB1 deficient mice and tumour
volume was measured over time. B) The weight of tumour
mass was scored after 25 days. C) After 25 days lung were
explanted and the number of lung metastasis was counted in
WT and homozygous mutant.

To scrutinize further vessel growth within the primary
tumours, we stained tissue sections with an antibody
against CD31 endothelial marker, and analyzed them by
fluorescence microscopy. We could not reveal morphological differences between tumour vessels in mutant and
WT mice. In addition, we quantified total vessel area and
vessel density (the number of vessels per mm2) in tumour
sections. In both cases, we did not measure a significant
change in PlexinB1 -/- compared to WT mice.

Discussion
Plexins were originally characterized for their role in the
wiring of neural network as receptors for Semaphorin
guidance cues. However, accumulating lines of evidence
later prompted the investigators to reappraise and revise
the biological role of these molecules. First, it was found
that many Plexins are widely expressed outside the nervous system. Moreover, as the signal transduction mechanisms start to be uncovered, it is now clear that Plexins can
impinge on a range of signaling pathways potentially regulating cell adhesion, cell proliferation and differentiation.
Here we demonstrate, by immunohistochemical analysis,
the expression of PlexinB1 receptor and of its ligand
Sema4D in diverse epithelial tissues and in the nervous
system, suggesting that PlexinB1 might play multiple
functional roles in vivo, during development and in the
adult stage. In fact, this is the first extensive analysis, in the

Previous expression studies and experiments in vitro had
highlighted a potential role for secreted semaphorins and
their receptors during tubular morphogenesis in the lung
[22] and in the kidney [24], and it was hypothesized that
these guidance cues may define permissive and restricted
regions for cell migration. Interestingly, based on our
expression analysis, Sema4D-PlexinB1 signaling might
have a role in this function, for instance at the boundaries
between different cell populations. Moreover, PlexinB1
can regulate the activation of Met [13], a tyrosine kinase
receptor known to mediate tubular morphogenesis in
fetal lung and kidney [25]. In spite of these facts, the
genetic deletion of PlexinB1 did not lead to morphological or functional abnormalities, indicating that the function of this semaphorin receptor is redundant in
development. Notably, developing kidney and lung also
express PlexinB2 [20], another putative Sema4D receptor
[26]. Although we observed that PlexinB2 binds to
Sema4D with lower affinity than PlexinB1 (J.P. and L.T.,
unpublished observation), it is conceivable that PlexinB2
can compensate for the lack of PlexinB1 in these organs.
In fact, by measuring PlexinB2 mRNA levels in tissues
with real time PCR, we found significant expression in
liver and kidney, which did not increase in PlexinB1-deficient mice (not shown).
These findings are in line with that found in previously
reported mouse mutants of semaphorins or plexins
expressed in developing lung (such as Sema3A [27],
Sema3F [28], PlexinA1 [29]), which also lack to show
obvious abnormalities of these organs [22,30]. Thus, this
scenario suggests a high level of redundancy in semaphorin signaling during branching morphogenesis and in
the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in lung and kidney. Moreover, since additional guidance cues are known
to regulate these developmental processes, it is conceivable that the absence of semaphorin signals may be compensated by functionally related morphogenetic factors
such as the Netrins and the Slits (for an extensive review
see [31]).
In contrast to the lung and the kidney, PlexinB1 expression in the liver is not consistent with a function as receptor for Sema4D, since we could not detect significant
expression of this semaphorin in the mouse liver at any
stage. This may suggest that hepatocytes or other liver cells
express as yet unidentified alternative ligands for
PlexinB1. Furthermore, since it was shown that Plexins
can associate in receptor complexes on the cell surface
[13,14] or regulate homophilic cell-cell adhesion [32,33],
it is also possible that PlexinB1 acts in the maintenance of

liver tissue architecture by functionally regulating other
receptors or homologous plexins.
It was previously shown that Sema4D-PlexinB1 signalling
can collapse the growth cone of hippocampal neurons in
culture [15]. Interestingly, we have observed loss of
responsiveness to Sema4D in PlexinB1-deficient neurons
derived from our mutants. On the other hand, our histological analysis revealed that the overall morphology, cell
composition and neural connections in the hippocampus
do not display obvious abnormalities in the absence of
PlexinB1, suggesting a compensation of Sema4D function
in development.
In the cerebellum, PlexinB1 is highly expressed in
Purkinje (Pk) cells during the postnatal development.
Notably, these neurons do not express PlexinB2 or CD72,
which are lower affinity receptors for Sema4D [19,21].
Incidentally, it was shown that Pk cells express PlexinB3
[33], but we previously demonstrated that this receptor
cannot bind Sema4D [34]. PlexinB1 distribution in the
cerebellum appears consistent with the traditional role of
Plexins as receptors for neurite outgrowth inhibitory cues.
In fact, during the first postnatal days, Purkinje axons
show exuberant sprouting of collateral branches that are
eventually pruned during cerebellar development [23].
The final shaping of Pk axons is associated with the axonal
myelination mediated by the olygodendrocytes that
express Sema4D [21]. However, our analysis shows that
Pk axons are correctly myelinated and the pruning of
excessive branches occurs normally in the PlexinB1
mutant mice. It is noteworthy that PlexinB1 in Pk cells is
also present in the perikaryon and dendrites. In addition,
the protein shows different levels of expression in Pk cell
subsets, corresponding to morphofunctional modules of
the cerebellar cortex [35]. Together with the precise distribution of Sema4D in the molecular layer, these observations suggest that Sema4D-PlexinB1 signalling may play a
role in regulating the patterning and plasticity of intracortical connectivity, although this may be compensated during cerebellar development by alternative pathways.

gate major functions in PlexinB1-deficient mice. Our data
show that liver and kidney functions were normal. In
addition, we found that hematopoiesis and coagulation
parameters were not affected (data not shown).
Furthermore, it was proposed that PlexinB1 expressed by
endothelial cells may mediate the pro-angiogenic activity
of Sema4D released by tumour cells [18]. Tumourinduced angiogenesis is of fundamental importance in
cancer progression; in fact, hampering the formation of
new vessels is now a popular strategy to restrain tumour
growth. In order to test the functional requirement for
PlexinB1 in this process, we exploited B16 melanoma
transplants, which are commonly used to study tumour
growth and angiogenesis in the context of syngenic
C57BL/6 mouse models. We found that B16 cells produce
Sema4D and tested their ability to grow and induce angiogenesis in PlexinB1-deficient mice. Our results suggest
that the angiogenic activity of Sema4D may be mediated
not only by PlexinB1, but also via other receptors
expressed in endothelial cells (e.g. PlexinB2, see Additional file 4, panel C). Future studies will tell whether
other tumour models are equally capable to grow in a
PlexinB1-deficient tissue microenvironment.

Conclusion
Collectively, our data concerning PlexinB1 and Sema4D
expression suggest that PlexinB1 may carry out multiple
functions during development and in the adult. Nonetheless, our analysis of PlexinB1 mutant mice did not show
any major impairment in embryo development or differentiated functions in the adult, including the neo-angiogenetic response induced by tumour growth. We conclude
that PlexinB1 plays a redundant role during development,
in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and in tumour
angiogenesis.

Methods

The absence of clear developmental defects in PlexinB1
mutants is consistent with that reported for Sema4D-deficient mice. In fact, the latter were only found to have
minor defects in the immune response, likely attributed to
defective CD72 signaling [36], which is an alternative
low-affinity receptor for Sema4D expressed in lymphocytes.

mRNA expression analysis
A human multiple tissue array (MTE™) was purchased
from Clonetech laboratories (Cat. #775-1). It contains
mRNA in amounts normalized for the expression of eight
different housekeeping genes. The P32 radioactive
labelled cDNA probe used for hybridization contained a 4
kb divergent sequence encoding plexin extracellular
domain obtained by EcoRI restriction of human full
length construct. The hybridisation was performed using
Ultrahybe® solution (Ambion Austin, TX, US) according
to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.

Our expression analysis had revealed that PlexinB1 is
importantly expressed in a number of adult tissues, potentially suggesting a physiological role beyond embryo
development. To address this point, in addition to study
tissue histology, we have performed blood tests to investi-

Cells (Cambrex) was detected by RT-PCR using gene-specific primer pairs provided by Applied Biosystem
(Hs00182227_m1 for PlexinB1, and Hs00367063_m1

mRNA In situ hybridyzation
Whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH) was according
to standard protocol. Briefly, embryos were fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBT (0.1%
Tween 20 in PBS), progressively dehydrated in increasing
concentrations of ethanol/PBT, stored at -20°C, then
rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol/PBT
and treated with proteinase K (10 μg/ml in PBS). They
were then postfixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde,
0.1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1% Tween 20 and prehybridized 1 hr at 70°C in 1.3× SSC, 50% formamide, 2% Tween
20, 5% dextran, 5 mM EDTA, and 50 μg/ml yeast RNA.
Sense and control antisense ryboprobes were synthesized
using T7 and SP6 polymerases with a kit for DIG labeling
(Roche Diagnostics). The probes were amplified by PCR
(for PlexinB1: sense GCT AAC AGC TGT GGC AAT CA,
antisense GGG ACA TTG GAA GCT ATG GA; for Sema4D
sense GTC TTC GTC CTC AGG TCT GC, antisense CGA
CAG GTT GAA GAT GAG CA) and subcloned in
TOPO™TA vector (Invitrogen). Hybridization was performed overnight with DIG-labeled riboprobes in the
same buffer of prehybridization. Washes with hybridization buffer were followed by RNase A treatment (10 μg/ml
in 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.1% Tween 20,
1 hr at 37°C), and subsequent washes with hybridization
buffer at 65°C. Embryos were then blocked in MABT (0.1
M maleate, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5)
containing 20% sheep serum, and incubated overnight at
4°C with anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugate
(Roche Diagnostics) diluted 1: 2000 in MABT with 2%
sheep serum. After extensive washes with MABT, revelation was performed using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Diagnostics) in 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, and
0.1 M Tris pH 9.5.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed
according to standard techniques. For the embryo and the
epithelial tissues, samples were collected and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde/PBS, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 6 μm. Sections were deparaffinised and processed. For immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections, all
primary antibodies were diluted in Tris buffered saline
0.1% Tween20, 5% FBS. Our anti-PlexinB1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (raised against the following epitope in
the extracellular domain: RNLHLFQDGPGDNEC) was
used 1:500; murine monoclonal anti-Sema4D (BD Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) was
used 1:100; anti Smooth muscle actin (Sigma) was diluted
1:500. Sections were incubated overnight with the primary antibody, washed, incubated for 1 hour with DakoCytomationEnVision+® System (Dako, CA, US) and
diamminobenzidine staining was developed according to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/55

manufacturer instructions. Haematoxylin, eosin and reagents for PAS staining were purchased from Bio Optica
(Milan, Italy) and used following the instructions of the
producer. Paraffin sections were examined with LeicaDMLB light microscope connected to a LeicaDFC320
digital camera.
For the cerebellum the histology was performed as previously described [37]. Briefly, deeply anaesthetized mice
were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde
in 0.12 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The brains were dissected, kept in the same fixative overnight and cyroprotected in 30% sucrose 0.12 M phosphate buffer. The
cerebella were cut by freezing microtome in 30 μm thick
sagittal or frontal sections and collected in Tris buffered
saline (pH 7.4). Anti-Calbindin D-28K (CaBP; rabbit polyclonal; Swant, Bellinzona, Swizerland) was used 1:3000;
anti-Myelin basic protein (MBP; mouse monoclonal;
Sternberger monoclonal, Baltimore, MD, USA) was
diluted 1:2000; anti-Parvalbumin (mouse monoclonal,
Swant, Bellinzona, Swizerland) was diluted 1:2000; anti
PlexinB1 monoclonal antibody was used 1:500. The antibodies were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
with 0.25% Triton X-100 with 0.2% normal serum of the
species of the secondary antibody. For immunohistochemistry sections were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) reacted with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method (Vectastain, ABC standard Kit; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and revealed using
diamminobenzidine as a chromogen. For double immunofluorescence sections were incubated for 1 h with FITCH
conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200 in PBS-triton with
0.2% normal serum; Sigma). After rinsing, they were
again incubated overnight at 4° biotinylated anti-mouse
antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
USA), followed by Texas Red conjugated streptavidin
(1:200 in PBS-Triton; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR,
USA). Nissl staining was performed according to ordinary
techniques. Cerebellar sections were examined with a
Zeiss Axiophot light microscope and an Olympus
Fluoview 300 confocal microscope.
Digital images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0
to adjust contrast.
The number of glomeruli in the kidney was counted in
sagittal sections taken in the middle of the kidney and
counterstained with haematoxylin and eosin. Five sections were evaluated per mouse and three wild type mice
were compared with three mutant mice.
For vessel staining, tumour samples of similar volume
(about 5 mm in diameter) were snap frozen in isopropanol at -60°, sectioned at the criostat and postfixed for 10'

Generation of PlexinB1 mutant mice
A cosmidic clone containing the murine PlexinB1 gene
was obtained by screening a RZPD (Berlin, Germany)
genomic library. A targeting vector was designed to flank
exons 22 and 23 of PlexinB1 with two loxP sites. A neo
gene flanked by two FRT sites and a LacZ reporter gene
were placed in frame with exon 24. A 10 kb fragment was
used as a 5' homology region, a 1 kb fragment was placed
between the two loxP sites, and a 2 kb fragment was used
as 3' homology region. Embryonic stem cells (W9.5) were
transfected, cultured and selected for resistance against
G418. Homologous recombined clones were identified
by Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested DNA, using
an external probe that was amplified by PCR (sense
primer GGT CTG ACC CTG GAT ATG GA; antinsense
primer CCA CCCTCT TTT ATG CCT GA). Chimeric mice
were generated by injection of homologous recombined
ES cell clones into blastocystes from C57BL/6 mice. Matings of male chimeras to C57BL/6 females yielded germline transmitted offsprings. Mice carrying the mutated
PlexinB1 gene were crossed with C57BL/6 CRE deleter
mice in order to achieve the excision of exons 22 and 23.
The correct excision was checked by PCR (sense AAC ACC
ATG TGT ATG CTG GAG AGG TCA GGG; antisense CAT
CGC CTT CTA TCG CCT TCT TGA CG). Mice genotyping
was carried out by PCR using a primer pair for the WT
(sense AAC ACC ATG TGT ATG CTG GAG AGG TCA GGG;
antisense GGG TCA CTG ATT CGT TTC TCA GAA CAC
TGA C) and the same primers used to check CRE excision
for the mutant allele.

Loss of PlexinB1 expression was confirmed in mutant
mice by protein immunopurification and Western blotting using IC-2 antibodies, as previously described [38].
Cultures of hippocampal neurons
Primary hippocampal neurons, isolated from neonatal P1
mice, were cultured as previously described [39]. Briefly,
the hippocampi were isolated, trypsinized and cultured at
low density in Neurobasal Medium supplemented with
2% B27 and 2% FCS. After 48 hours in culture neurons
were stimulated for 1 hour with a purified preparation of
Sema4D. Soluble Sema4D was purified from the conditioned media of cells transfected with a cDNA expression

Tumourigenesis assays in vivo
Sema4D expression in melanoma cells was detected using
clone 30 antibody (BD-Transduction lab), by immunopurification and Western blotting experiments according to
standard protocols [38]. Tumourigenesis assays were performed as previously described [41]. Shortly, 75000 B16
melanoma cells were diluted in PBS up to a final volume
of 200 μl and injected subcutaneously into the right posterior flanks of 8-week old WT, heterozygous and
homozygous PlexinB1 mutant mice. Tumour volume was
calculated as described [41]. At the end of the observation
period, tumours were weighed. Superficial pulmonary
metastases were counted under a stereoscopic microscope
taking advantage of the black pigmentation of B16
melanoma cell line.
Blood tests
Blood tests were performed according to ordinary analytical techniques. Briefly, blood samples were collected via
intra-cardiac puncture in presence of Na Citrate to avoid
blood clotting and analyzed using photometric method
(Modular Roche diagnostic).
