Complete genome sequence of a marine
roseophage provides evidence into the evolution
of gene transfer agents in alphaproteobacteria

Abstract
Roseophage RDJLF1 is a siphovirus isolated from South China Sea on Roseobacter denitrificans OCh114. Its virion
encapsulates 62.7 kb genome that encodes 87 gene products. RDJLF1 shares similar genome organization and
gene content with the marine bacteriophage FJL001 and Pseudomonas phages YuA and M6, which are different
from those of typical l- or Mu-like phages. Four hallmark genes (ORFs 81 to 84) of RDJLF1 were highly
homologous to RcGTA-like genes 12 to 15. The largest gene (ORF 84) was predicted to encode a tail fibre protein
that could be involved in host recognition. Extended phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses based on
77 RcGTA-like element-containing bacterial genomes revealed that RcGTA-like genes 12 to 15 together appear to
be a conserved modular element that could also be found in some phage or prophage genomes. Our study
suggests that RcGTA-like genes-containing phages and prophages and complete RcGTAs possibly descended from
a same prophage ancestor that had diverged and then evolved vertically. The complete genome of RDJLF1
provides evidence into the hypothesis that extant RcGTA may be a prophage remnant.
Findings
Viruses are the most abundant entities of the world’s
oceans, ranging from ~3×106 to ~108 viruses per ml [1].
Bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) are known
to play an important role in regulating the species composition of bacteria [1-4] and in the host evolution
through phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer [5-7].
Bacteria in the Roseobacter clade (roseobacter hereafter)
are abundant, and typically comprise 10-20% of marine
bacterial communities [8,9]. More than 30 genomes of
representative roseobacters have been sequenced [10],
and the genomics studies also showed that nearly all
roseobacter genomes carry a conserved gene transfer
agent (GTA) gene cluster of RcGTA (GTA producted
by Rhodobacter capsulatus) type [10-14] which could
assemble a phage-like particle that transfers random
pieces of genome DNA from producing cells to recipient
cells through a generalized transduction-like process
[15]. The widespread occurrence of RcGTA was

hypothesized to be a potential efficient mechanism for
horizontal gene transfer [13].
Up to date, only a limited number of roseophage
(phage that infects roseobacter) genomes have been
reported [16-18], which were all in Podoviridae family.
In this study, we presented the genome sequence of
Roseophage RDJLF1 that infects Roseobacter denitrificans OCh114. RDJLF1 was isolated from the South
China Sea surface water (17.597°N, 116.029°E) collected
in September 2007 as previously described [19]. RDJLF1
was characterized as a host-specific siphovirus, which
has an isometric head and a long, flexible, non-contractile tail, and belongs to Siphoviridae family, Caudovirales order [19]. RDJLF1 is a lytic phage with burst size
of ca. 203 and latent period of ca. 80 min [19]. This is
the first presented genome of a siphovirus infecting
marine Roseobacter.
The circularly assembled genome of RDJLF1 comprises 62,668 bp, with a G+C content of 57.9%, strongly
resembling the G+C average (58.0%) of its host. The
whole genome was sequenced by using shotgun library
method with 7-fold coverage. In total, 87 open reading
frames (ORFs) were predicted from the genome using
Glimmer [20] and GeneMark [21] (Additional file 1,

Figure 1). No tRNA sequences were identified using the
tRNAscan-SE program [22]. Fifty-five gene products
have homologous sequences in NCBI non-redundant
protein database, whereas only 24 of them have predicted functions. Thirty-eight ORFs are homologous to
genes in bacteriophages. Among them, 15 ORFs were
homologues of genes in another siphovirus FJL001 that
infects an uncharacterized marine sponge-associated
alphaproteobacterium, JL001 [23] (Figure 1, indicated by
grey shadows). Most of these homologues between
RDJLF1 and FJL001 scatter in similar loci of the genomes. Based on the sequence homology, RDJLF1 is
most closely related to FJL001 among all the known
phage genomes. Moreover, 7 of those 15 ORFs are also
homologous to genes from Pseudomonas phage YuA
[24] and/or M6 [25]; YuA and M6 are 91% identical to
each other at the DNA level [24]. Five phage structural
proteins, which are tail fibre protein (gp84), tail tape
measure protein (gp80), major tail protein (gp78), major
capsid protein (gp74) and an unknown structural protein (gp67), could be assigned based on the previously
reported proteome analysis (Table 1; the five proteins

The RDJLF1 genome can be divided into three
modules: (i) DNA metabolism and replication, (ii)
phage-host interaction, (iii) DNA packaging and structure formation (Figure 1). This type of genome organization is similar to those of FJL001, YuA and M6, but
differs from those of l- and Mu-like phages [24].
RDJLF1, FJL001, YuA and M6 also share the similar
gene contents in the three modules. No lysis genes were

predicted in RDJLF1 genome, whereas lysis cassettes
including four genes (endopeptidase Rz, embedded Rz1,
holing and endolysin) were found in YuA and M6 genomes [24]. Phylogenetic analysis based on terminase
large subunit (TerL) protein showed that RDJLF1 fell
into the “P22-like headful” cluster and was closely
related to Salmonella phages ES18, E1 and Listonella
phage FHSIC (Additional file 2). Despite the factor that
RDJLF1, YuA, M6 and FJL001 share certain genomic
similarity, temperate phages YuA, M6 and FJL001 clustered closely together but distantly to RDJLF1.
Phages that infect marine, even aquatic, bacteria are isolated and characterized less frequently than terrestrial
phages, resulting in the difficulty in their taxonomic
classifications.
Four ORFs (81, 82, 83 and 84) of RDJLF1 are homologous to RcGTA genes 12, 13, 14 and 15, respectively
[12,15] (Additional file 1, Figure 2). gp81 is most closely
related to the glycoside hydrolase which could also be
the putative product of RcGTA gene 12. ORF 82 was
identified as a homologue of RcGTA gene 13 which
encodes a structural protein detected by proteomic
approaches [26]. ORF 83 contains a phage-related cell
wall peptidase domain and was predicted to encode a
hydrolase belonging to the NlpC/P60 superfamily. The
product of its homologue in RcGTA (gene 14) was not
found in proteome [26]. Previously, it was implied that
NlpC/P60 proteins from bacteriophages may help them
penetrate the bacterial cell wall [27]. We propose that
gp83 in RDJLF1 may have the same function based on
sequence homology. ORF 84 is highly homologous to
RcGTA gene 15, the largest gene encoding a single 138
kDa protein [26], which contains a rhamnosyl transferase homology and was suggested to mediate interaction
between RcGTA particles and the capsule of recipient
cells [28]. A 147.6 kDa homologous protein was also
detected in our previous phage proteome analysis
(Table 1). We inferred that this protein serves as a component of tail fibre, which is known to be involved in
host specificity in broad types of tailed phages. Typical
RcGTA-like gene cluster such as that in R. capsulatus is
15 kb long and encodes 15 gene products (Figure 2)
[12,28]. Protein sequences of gp81 to gp84 in RDJLF1
are 35-49% identical to the corresponding sequences in
RcGTA, which is the highest level of identity that we
have found between RcGTA and phage sequences. Similar identity range (30-50%) was observed between
RcGTA and RcGTA-like elements in other alphaproteobacteria [29]. These four RcGTA-like genes have been
previously found in phage FJL001 (ORFs 83-86) [12]. It
is noteworthy that FJL001 contains unmatched
sequences inside ORF84 and 86 when aligned with their
homologues (Figure 2, indicated by white boxes internal
to blue arrows). This suggests that FJL001 could be

Page 3 of 6

relatively distantly related to RcGTA-like elements in
alphaproteobacteria.
We retrieved 80 RcGTA-like gene clusters (some are
partial) from 77 bacterial genomes and carried out phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated translated
sequences of RcGTA-like genes 12 to 15. The neighborjoining tree shows that RDJLF1 are most closely related
to Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222, Rhodobacter sphaeroides ATCC 17025 and Rhodobacter sp. SW2 (group II
in Figure 3). We also examined the neighboring
sequences of all these RcGTA-like structures. Interestingly, typical phage-like genes such as those encoding
integrase, small and large terminase subunits, portal,
major capsid, and tail tape measure proteins (TMP,
coded by tmp) were identified to the left of the RcGTAlike genes from the bacterial genomes of Rhodobacter
sp. SW2, Burkholderia phymatum STM815 (plasmid
pBPHY01), Variovorax paradoxus S110 and Oligotropha
carboxidovorans OM5 (O. carboxidovorans OM5 has
two RCGTA-like structures, it refers to “OM5 2” here)
(Figure 3). There are three evidences supporting the
idea that these structures are not potential RcGTA-like
gene clusters but functional elements of prophage genomes. First, no homology to RcGTA-like genes 1 to 11
was found in these gene structures. Second, other
phage-like genes were found in the left arms, especially
the integrase genes. Third, the tmp genes are much larger than those in RcGTA-like structures (2424~2739 bp
vs. 660 bp). It was demonstrated that phage tail length
has significant correspondence with its gene size of tmp
[30]. These tmp genes in the aforementioned four bacterial genomes appear to code for components of long
phage tails rather than tails of RcGTA-like particles.
Lang and Beatty [12,29] suggested that RcGTA-like element is likely a remnant of a prophage ancestor that
evolved to be a RcGTA progenitor in an alphaproteobacterium by losing replication, regulatory genes, and
that this RcGTA progenitor then have processed a predominantly vertical descent. Partial RcGTA-like gene
clusters in genuine phages and putative prophages provide evidence supporting this suggestion. It is interesting
that STM815 and S110 are both betaproteobacteria. It is
likely that RDJLF1, FJL001 and potential prophages in
SW2, STM815, S110 and OM5 have been evolving from
the proposed “prophage ancestor” and keeping the four
conserved RcGTA-like genes, rather than acquired them
from RcGTA-like gene clusters in alphaproteobacteria at
a recent evolutionary time. They could be the “remnant”
of the intermediate form on the way from “prophage
ancestor” to RcGTA progenitor. Intriguingly, even a partial RcGTA-like structure and a complete one from the
same bacterial genome (e.g. PD1222, ATCC 17025 and
OM5) could diverge distantly and evolve independently
(Figure 3).

Figure 2 RcGTA-like gene structure of roseophage RDJLF1. For comparison, partial genome of bacteriophage FJL001, prophage-like gene
structures in Rhodobacter sp. SW2 [NZ_ACYY00000000], B. phymatum STM815 plasmid pBPHY01 [NC_010625] and V. paradoxus S110
[NC_012791] and GTA gene cluster of R. capsulatus [AF181080] were shown. Homologues were indicated by grey shadows.

The RcGTA-like gene cluster appears to consist of
two modular components: (i) head-to-tail module
(gene 1 to 11); (ii) tail fibre and host recognition
module (gene 12 to 15). It is interesting that up to
date RcGTA-like genes in a (pro)phage have been
found either from region (i) or region (ii), but not
from both. Likely, the juncture between regions
(i) and (ii) is a hotspot for genetic recombination.

The last four RcGTA-like genes seem to be a conserved element as a unit. The vertical descent inside
the RcGTA-like gene clusters appears to be unbalanced that losing or keeping some element could be
under certain selective pressure. However, the reason
why some (pro)phages tend to retain gene module (ii)
that is associated with the putative host recognition
function is not clear.

Figure 3 Phylogenetic relationships of concatenated protein sequences of RcGTA-like genes 12-15 from bacteriophages and bacteria.
Amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal X2 [31] and phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Mega 4.0 software [32]. Neighborjoining tree was constructed using the minimum evolution distance with default parameters. Bootstrap resamplings were performed for 1,000
replications and the values (> 50%) for major branches were shown on the edge of the circular tree, except one in the center indicated by an
arrow. Highly supported major subclusters were separated by dashed lines. The numbers in the end of names of bacteria (P. denitrificans PD1222,
R. sphaeroides ATCC 17025 and O. carboxidovorans OM5) indicate multiple RcGTA-like elements in one bacterial genome. The four gene clusters
in group II only contain RcGTA-like genes 12 to 15. Both PD1222 and ATCC 17025 also contain a complete RcGTA-like gene cluster (in group I).
The scale bar represents 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site.
