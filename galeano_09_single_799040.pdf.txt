Abstract
Background: Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are an important source of gene-based markers
such as those based on insertion-deletions (Indels) or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
Several gel based methods have been reported for the detection of sequence variants, however
they have not been widely exploited in common bean, an important legume crop of the developing
world. The objectives of this project were to develop and map EST based markers using analysis
of single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), to create a transcript map for common bean
and to compare synteny of the common bean map with sequenced chromosomes of other legumes.
Results: A set of 418 EST based amplicons were evaluated for parental polymorphisms using the
SSCP technique and 26% of these presented a clear conformational or size polymorphism between
Andean and Mesoamerican genotypes. The amplicon based markers were then used for genetic
mapping with segregation analysis performed in the DOR364 × G19833 recombinant inbred line
(RIL) population. A total of 118 new marker loci were placed into an integrated molecular map for
common bean consisting of 288 markers. Of these, 218 were used for synteny analysis and 186
presented homology with segments of the soybean genome with an e-value lower than 7 × 10-12.
The synteny analysis with soybean showed a mosaic pattern of syntenic blocks with most segments
of any one common bean linkage group associated with two soybean chromosomes. The analysis
with Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus presented fewer syntenic regions consistent with the
more distant phylogenetic relationship between the galegoid and phaseoloid legumes.
Conclusion: The SSCP technique is a useful and inexpensive alternative to other SNP or Indel
detection techniques for saturating the common bean genetic map with functional markers that
may be useful in marker assisted selection. In addition, the genetic markers based on ESTs allowed
the construction of a transcript map and given their high conservation between species allowed
synteny comparisons to be made to sequenced genomes. This synteny analysis may support
positional cloning of target genes in common bean through the use of genomic information from
these other legumes.

Background
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/
deletion events (Indels) represent the most frequent polymorphisms found in eukaryotic genomes. For example, in
humans the frequency of SNP polymorphisms is one per
kilobase and given the large size of the human genome
the total number of SNPs has been estimated to be over of
3.1 million [1,2]. Similarly, high SNP frequencies have
been reported in plant genomes, especially in out-crossing
species, but the discovery process has been slower despite
the small genomes of some species. Examples include
grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), an out-crossing species, where
one SNP occurs every 78 bp [3] or maize (Zea mays L.)
where the average frequency of SNPs was one every 43
bases in 1,088 maize gene sequences and where Indels
were also common [4]. In a self pollinated species such as
soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr), the SNP frequency was
reported as one SNP every 191 bp in non-coding regions
and one SNP every two kilobases in coding regions based
on 15 genotypes and 35 genomic or gene fragments [5].
Rice (Oryza sativa L.), another inbreeding species, had one
SNP every 300 bp in coding regions and one SNP every 37
bp in transposable elements when comparing indica and
japonica subspecies [6] and recently 159,478 high-quality,
non-redundant SNPs were found across the entire rice
genome [7]. In this study, our interest was to develop SNP
and Indel based markers for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), an important legume in terms of food security
but one that has been less well studied as it is found
mostly in developing countries.
Expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries offer important
information for species that have not been sequenced and
are a central source of gene-based markers and SNP or
Indel polymorphisms. Discovery of these polymorphisms
usually involves alignment of sequences obtained from
the sequencing of EST libraries from different genotypes
of the same species [8] or from re-sequencing of PCR fragments [9]. EST-based markers are valuable because they
represent sequences that are transcribed and therefore can
potentially be associated with phenotypic differences.
Furthermore, EST based markers are often highly conserved between species allowing the construction of transcript maps and synteny comparisons between genomes.
EST analysis in common bean shows that SNP frequency
appears to be similar or higher than in other self-pollinating species although fairly few studies have analyzed their
relative abundance across different regions of the genome
or across the wide diversity of common bean accessions.
In a pioneering study for the crop, Ramirez et al. [10]
found that SNP frequency in EST sequences from two genotypes of common bean (the Andean G19833 versus the
Mesoamerican Negro Jamapa) was 529 SNPs in 214 kb of
SNP-containing contigs, with a frequency of one SNP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/629

every 387 bp in this inter-genepool comparison. Recently,
Gaitán-Solís et al. [11] reported 239 SNPs and 133 Indels
in 45 gene-coding and non-coding fragments analyzed in
10 cultivated and wild bean genotypes belonging to the
Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools finding an average
frequency of one SNP every 88 bp and one Indel every 157
bp. The high frequency of SNPs and overall genotype
diversity in common bean makes this species amenable to
SNP marker development.
EST conversion to SNP based molecular markers and their
use in saturation or comparative mapping has been an
important recent area of research and several techniques
for SNP analysis have been reported [12]. For example, in
common bean three methods have been used for EST
marker conversion based on SNP polymorphisms. In the
first, cleaved amplified PCR fragment techniques (CAPS
and dCAPS) were used to convert EST based polymorphisms into genetic markers [13]. A second attempt
involved a high-throughput system named Luminex-100
which was used to confirm SNP calls in DNA from 10
common bean genotypes, finding 2.5% of SNPs were miscalled and 1% had no signal as compared with direct
sequencing [11]. In an effort to simplify SNP analysis,
Galeano et al. [14] used CEL I mismatch digestions to analyze and map SNP-based, EST-derived markers, finding
that the method worked well with SNPs located in the
middle of amplification fragments and that digestion
products could be visualized on agarose gels.
Some of these techniques require specialized equipment
or ingredients, which some molecular marker laboratories
may not have. Therefore, a recent goal in our laboratory
has been to identify a gel-based alternative that does not
require restriction enzyme digestion. In this regard, we
have found single strand conformational polymorphism
(SSCP) analysis to be a good alternative. The SSCP technique is based on conformational differences of single
stranded DNA fragments that can be detected as mobility
shifts in non-denaturing polyacryilamide gel electrophoresis [15]. This technique is easy and inexpensive to
implement as we show in this study and has been used to
analyzing gene or EST derived SNP markers in various
plant species such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)[16,17],
barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)[18], grapevine (Vitis vinifera
L.)[3], cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)[19], pearl millet
[Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.][20] and Pinus species [21].
In this study, our objective was to develop and map SSCP
markers on an integrated genetic map for common bean
using EST or gene-based markers from various sources.
The molecular mapping of genic SNPs and Indels through
this technique also provided the basis to analyze synteny
of homologous loci across the legumes. In relation to this,
the genetic map information and the marker sequences

were used for an analysis of macro-synteny between the
genome of common bean and the genomes of Glycine
max, Lotus japonicus (Lotus) and Medicago truncatula (Medicago).

morphisms between Andean genotypes (G19833 and Jalo
EEP508) and Mesoamerican genotypes (DOR364 and
BAT93), while the amplicons for g774 and g776 showed
monomorphism in product size. The amplicons for
BSNP68, BSNP69 and BSNP70 (Figure 1b) were also
monomorphic in size (no indel) but as described in Additional File 1 were designed to cover the SNPs in contig
2624 from Ramirez et al. [10]. All of these amplicons are
examples of the quality and specificity of the amplicon
required to initiate the SSCP technique. In total, 11 amplicons showed size polymorphisms showing that indels are
not frequent in the marker set used in this study.

Results
Parental survey
After the standardization process, a total of 418 amplicons
were successfully amplified on the four genotypes evaluated. Of these, 93 amplicons were derived from SNP containing EST sequences of Ramirez et al. [10] and
corresponded to BSNP markers either newly developed
here or from Galeano et al. [14], 300 amplicons were from
the "g" series developed by NDSU and 25 amplicons were
from the SNP containing fragments reported by GaitánSolís et al. [11]. Figure 1a shows examples of polymorphic
and monomorphic PCR products evaluated on agarose
gels for indel type size polymorphisms. In that figure,
amplicons for g755 and g762 presented clear size polyg755

SSCP polymorphism, meanwhile, was found in 106 out
of the 418 amplicons tested in the parental survey for
mapping parents used in this study. This included screening on MDE gels of all the amplicons that did not contain
indel polymorphisms from the agarose gel screening. The
overall SSCP polymorphism rate was similar for the par-

PCR product size was not found to affect SSCP detection
in the BSNP markers and this method could be used for
amplicons up to 1 kb in size. For example, Figure 1c shows
the electrophoresis profile of parental genotypes divided
into groups A, B and C consisting in light molecular
weight (50-200 bp), medium molecular weight (200-600
bp) and high molecular weight (600 -1000 bp) products,
respectively, proving the versatility of the MDE technique
to detect SSCPs in amplicons with a wide range of molecular weights. Gel migration was lengthier for the larger
molecular weight fragments than for the smaller molecular weight fragments with as little as four hours of run
time needed for the first group and 16 hours needed for
the third group. It was notable, that some amplicons for
the BSNP markers presented molecular weights in agarose
gel evaluation that were greater than expected, suggested
the presence of intronic regions, even though primer
design had been based on fragments of 500 bp or less.
PCR products were obtained up to 1000 bp (eg. marker
BSNP869) and the smallest amplicons were as small as
100 bp (marker BSNP5) and both extremes were equally
amenable to SSCP evaluation.
Molecular mapping and linkage analysis
After the parental screening, the polymorphic amplicons
were evaluated as genetic markers for the entire DOR364
× G19833 RILs population. All 106 resulting loci evaluated with the SSCP technique were placed in the linkage
map, along with a further 11 Indel based markers evaluated for segregation with agarose gels. Figure 2 shows
examples of the SSCP based markers evaluated in the population having typical segregation pattern for parental
alleles of 1:1 for a co-dominant marker evaluated in a
recombinant inbred line population. In the case of the
marker g89 a few heterozygous individuals were detected.
Apart from the SSCP detection, one marker was mapped
with CEL I heteroduplex digestion as reported by Galeano
et al. [14] for a total of 118 markers evaluated in the population for the genetic mapping portion of this study. The
11 amplicons/markers evaluated with agarose gel evaluation were g128, g166, g755, g993, g1148, g1341, g1388,
g2068, g2510, g2647, gCV542014 while the marker evaluated using CEL I heteroduplex digestion was BSNP78.
Segregation of the new marker loci was analyzed along

between the Andean and Mesoamerican genotypes using
the SSCP technique. Among the polymorphic amplicons
for the mapping population, 34 were for BSNP markers
from Galeano et al. [14], 66 were for 'g' markers and 6

et al. [22,23], Caldas and Blair [24] and Beebe et al. [25]
as well as five CEL I based gene markers reported by
Galeano et al. [14].
The final genetic map which is shown in Figure 3 and
summarized in the Table 1 had 288 marker loci in total
with a full map length of 1,900 cM. Linkage group sizes
ranged from 75 cM (B10) to 268 cM (B09) with an average of 172 cM per linkage group. The number of marker
loci per linkage group ranged from 15 on B05 to 43 on
B02. The largest number of new marker loci (19) was
placed on linkage group B01 but an average of 11 new loci
were placed on each linkage group. The average distance
between the EST-based marker loci and the SSR or RFLP
marker loci was 13.5 cM and 10.6 cM, respectively and the
average distance between all loci was 6.8 cM. In general,
the marker loci were well distributed within the linkage
groups; however, some markers clustered in certain
regions of B01, B02 and B06. Segregation distortion was
found for 19% of the new marker loci (based on Chisquare tests at P < 0.05) which is similar to values in Blair
et al. (2003). In general the most highly distorted marker
loci were found on B02 and presented preferential transmission of the G19833 allele. The same distortion was
found in the middle of B01; while preferential transmission of the DOR364 alleles was found at the top of the
B09.
Synteny analysis
A total of 218 markers were used for the synteny analysis
based on sequences of EST contigs or singletons corresponding to the assembly of the new SSCP and Indel
based markers or the sequences for SSRs from Blair et al.

marker-based sequences were aligned against genomic
sequences of soybean showing 186 significant homologies based on a first hit E-value average of 10-13. In addition, a second match was recorded for the blastn
evaluation, because the soybean genome has had at least
two rounds of polyploidization [27], and therefore presumably has at least two homologous copies of each common bean gene or EST represented in distinct positions of
its genome. A total of 165 of the markers evaluated were
found to have a significant second match with the soybean genome. The first hit markers from the homology
search against the soybean genome were distributed
across all 11 linkage groups of the common bean genetic
map as shown in Figure 4 where the syntenic relationships
for each marker are indicated with flanking boxes identifying the soybean chromosome where its homolog or
homologs are found. On average 17 such conserved markers were present in each common bean linkage group with
the most syntenic relationships discovered for B02 (26
markers) and the least for B10 (9 markers).
Comparative mapping and sequence positioning between
common bean and soybean presented a mosaic pattern
where it was possible to identify syntenic regions based on
three or more markers matching from the same chromosome of soybean to the same region of a common bean
linkage group. Through this analysis, most common bean
linkage groups could be represented by several rearranged soybean chromosomes as seen in Figure 4. For
example, segments of linkage group B01 presented synteny with three pairs of soybean chromosomes (hereafter
named Gm), namely the top segment of B01 with Gm18
in first hits and Gm11 in second hits, the middle segment
with Gm19 and Gm3 and the bottom segment with
Gm17 and Gm14. Linkage group B02 presented synteny
with Gm5 and Gm8; and at the bottom with Gm1. Link-

1900.30

age group B03 was syntenic with Gm2 and Gm17 along
most of its entire length; while B04 showed synteny with
Gm2 at the top of the linkage group, with Gm16 in the
middle and with Gm13 and Gm19 at the bottom. Linkage
group B05 had synteny with Gm15 and Gm13 although
second hits were variable; while B06 presented a syntenic
block with Gm18 and Gm8 at the top of the linkage
group, with Gm15 and Gm13 in the middle and with
Gm12 at the bottom. B07 showed a syntenic block with
Gm10 and Gm20 except at the bottom of the linkage
group; while B08 showed synteny with Gm14 and Gm2 at
the top, and with Gm18 at the bottom. Linkage group B10
showed a syntenic block with Gm3 and Gm7; while B11
was syntenic with Gm 11 at the top, and Gm13 in the bottom. Finally, B09 was mostly syntenic with a single pair of
soybean chromosomes, Gm4 and Gm6, along its entire
length except at the very end.
The synteny analysis with M. truncatula and L. japonicus
resulted in totals of 109 and 78 homologous markers
linked to the common bean genome, respectively. These
represented averages of 10 and 7 anchor markers per linkage group in P. vulgaris for the two model legume
genomes, respectively. As seen in Figure 5, linkage group
B01 showed various syntenic blocks with L. japonicus
(hereafter named Lj), or M. truncatula chromosomes
(hereafter named Mt). Linkage group B02 showed syntenic blocks with Lj2 and Lj4, but no clear synteny with
the Medicago chromosomes. Linkage group B03 showed
segmental synteny with Lj4, Mt5 and Mt8. B04 showed
syntenic blocks from Lj1 and Mt6, and interestingly with
Mt0, a "false" chromosome where unanchored sequences
from the Medicago genome project are temporarily
housed. Linkage group B05 showed a syntenic block with
Lj3; while B06 showed a syntenic block with Lj6 and Mt2.
Linkage group B07 showed a syntenic block with Mt1;

Synteny 5
Figure relationships between common bean and Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula
Synteny relationships between common bean and Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula. Associations between
common bean, Lotus and Medicago linkage groups through sequence based markers. The number in the right and left hand
boxes indicate the chromosomes numbers of the Medicago and Lotus hits, respectively. Each chromosome from each legume
was assigned a different color with colors chosen to cover a large spectrum for ease of visualization.

B08 with Mt5 and Mt7 and B11 with Lj3. Meanwhile,
linkage groups B09 and B10 did not have a clear synteny
with the other legume genomes. In summary, the synteny
analysis of common bean with the genomes of Medicago,
Lotus and soybean showed that 50%, 36% and 85% of the
bean anchor markers had similarity with genes from these
species, respectively.

Discussion
Value of the SSCP based markers for map saturation
This study creates a transcript map for common bean
based on markers evaluated with SSCP gels which was
found to be an easy to use marker system to screen for single base substitutions and SNP polymorphisms as well as
small insertion-deletion events. In terms of marker development and testing, a total of 93 amplicons have now
been developed as part of the BSNP series which we began

the development of for the analysis of CEL I assays as
described in Galeano et al. [14] and which are based on
the 138 doubly-confirmed SNPs detected in Ramirez et al.
[10]. In addition we tested a total of 325 amplicons for
SSCP and Indel polymorphisms based on the genederived markers from Gaitan-Solís et al. [11] and the EST
derived markers from NDSU [28]. Genetic mapping was
shown to be successful with the SNP and Indel detection
techniques used in this study. Out of the full set of 418
amplicons tested, a total of 118 could be located on the
genetic map of common bean using the inter-genepool
population DOR364 × G19833 creating a more saturated
genetic map for common bean.
The new map presents important advantages since it is
based on a combination of cDNA-based and non-gene
markers, integrating the 118 new EST and gene-based

marker loci into a map that already had 165 SSR, STS or
RFLP markers for this population from Blair et al. [22,23],
Caldas and Blair [24] and Beebe et al. [25]. The result is
one of the most dense as well as most diverse molecular
maps available for common bean to date with a total of
288 single copy markers mapped in this population and a
full set of 451 markers for the population if we include
AFLP, RGA, RAPD and SCAR markers also mapped in this
population as described in those previous publications.
The success rate for the amplicons tested in this study in
terms of mapping with the SSCP detection techniques was
between 47% and 22% depending on the source of the
markers. For example, of the 72 SNP-EST contigs reported
by Ramirez et al [10] we were able to map 34 in this study
building on and improving over the initial mapping conducted in our earlier study (Galeano et al. [14]. Out of the
25 amplicons developed by Gaitan-Solis et al. [11] we
were able to place six markers through the SSCP technique
with the main advantage being that SSCP detection is
technically easier than the multiplex method used by
these authors. Finally, we were able to place 66 other gene
based markers through SSCP detection and 11 through
indel evaluation on the DOR364 × G19833 population
based on marker development at NDSU for the g series of
SNP markers. These latter markers have also been mapped
in the BAT93 × Jalo EEP508 as reported in the Legume
Information System [28] and are on equivalent linkage
groups with highly correlated marker order between both
genetic maps. Therefore, the present genetic map is a fully
integrated, centralized map for common bean given its
high marker saturation.
Several advantages of our SSCP technique as an option for
SNP and Indel discovery and genetic analysis were noted.
First, this technique did not require the special inputs
used by other SNP detection techniques [20] except for
the MDE component of SSCP gels and could be undertaken with standard equipment and PCR setups found in
most labs along with the same infrastructure and procedures used for SSR electrophoresis [22]. Secondly, our
SSCP evaluations were carried out with electrophoresis
conducted at a room temperature of 18 to 20°C rather
than refrigerated at 4°C showing that results are not sensitive to higher temperatures or to small temperature fluctuations. The MDE matrix has been reported previously as
not being sensitive to temperature [20,29]; nevertheless,
some SSCP studies have found temperature effects on
fragment migration and gel resolution when using acrylamide gels [15,16]. The reason for this sensitivity could be
explained because higher temperatures might destroy
some semi-stable conformations [15]; however, the MDE
gel appeared to produce a more stable behavior of DNA
conformations.
Polymorphism discovery through SSCP technology offers
a valuable tool for genetic which in the future can be com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/629

plemented by targeted approaches that increase the
chances of finding SNP polymorphisms for a given PCR
product and given cross combination. While SNP frequency seems to be high in inter-genepool comparisons
as we showed here for DOR364 and G19833, it appears to
be lower in within genepool comparisons for example
among two Andean genotypes [30]. One alternative is to
design primer pairs surrounding intron sequences that
tend to be more variable than exons as has been reported
by Choi et al. [31] and Bertioli et al. [32]. Another option
is to employ next generation sequencing prior to SSCP
marker design so as to rapidly many SNPs between individuals [33]. While common bean has not been the subject of next-generation sequencing yet, the range of EST
sequences found for the crop is a valuable source for further SNP discovery. In addition since common bean is
known to be very diverse based on SSR marker analysis of
the two major gene pools [34-36] analysis of sequence
information from multiple genotypes is likely to generate
new sources of SNPs useful for marker conversion and
SSCP analysis.
Utility of the transcript map for synteny analysis
Apart from the development of SSCP markers, our mapping of EST-based sequences allowed us to embark on
comparative mapping within the legumes and across the
Papilionoideae subfamily which contains the most
important group of crop legumes within two specific
clades that can benefit from cross-species analysis [37,38].
The galegoid clade, including the tribes Viceae, Trifolieae,
Cicereae and Loteae and the genera Vicia, Medicago, Cicer
and Lotus is made up of temperate species; while the phaseoloid clade, which is synonymous with the tribe Phaseoleae, includes the genera Phaseolus, Vigna and Glycine and
crops such as common bean, lima bean (P. lunatus),
tepary bean (P. acutifolius), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)
and soybean [39]. In this study, we took advantage of the
nearly full genome sequences now available for soybean,
Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus [40,41] to conduct
macrosynteny analysis with common bean based on
homology searches for the sequenced markers on our
genetic map. Similar studies have been conducted using
orthologous markers with or without sequence information across various crop and model legumes by Bertioli et
al [32]. Cannon et al. [42], Choi et al. [31,37], Hisano et
al. [43], Hougaard et al. [13] and Tsubokura et al. [44].

The synteny results from our study comparing common
bean linkage groups with soybean chromosomes showed
large macrosyntenic segments between parts of 'homeologous' chromosome pairs from the ancestrally polyploidy
genome of soybean syntenic and different parts of the diploid common bean genome. This allowed us to align most
of the 20 soybean chromosomes to the 11 individual linkage groups of common bean in paired segments as shown
in Additional file 2 (dotblot). The syntenic blocks found

between common bean and soybean Gm10-B07, Gm16B03, Gm5-B02, Gm19/Gm15/Gm12-B06, Gm18-B01,
Gm3-B10, Gm12/Gm11-B11 and Gm6-b09 were consistent with the RFLP based comparisons of the linkage maps
of soybean, common bean and Vigna radiata [45]. In addition, the specific synteny of Gm11/Gm12 with B11 was
corroborated by Lee et al [46] comparing the genome
organization of these same three legumes around the
genes Pa1 and Pa2 which encode pubescence in soybean.

[43] and Tsubokura et al. [44] found a limited degree of
macrosynteny between these species, perhaps because of
the complex structure of the soybean genome compared
to the simpler structure of the Lotus genome. Interestingly,
in both our study and the one from Hougaard et al. [13],
it was almost impossible to find synteny for linkage
groups B05 and B10 due to few anchor markers in these
regions suggesting that these linkage groups have lower
number of conserved or transcribed sequences.

Our results agree with previous studies suggesting that the
soybean genome has undergone two or more large scale
duplications and is probably an ancient polyploid [47].
Based on the common bean model, we identify some of
the duplicate chromosome regions in soybean. For example, linkage group B07 showed synteny with regions of
both Gm10 and Gm20 (corresponding to soybean linkage groups O and I). Duplication of this chromosome
from soybean was found when mapping BACs containing
paralogous ω-6 fatty acid desaturase (FAD2) genes [48]. I
n addition, our synteny results for linkage group B09 infer
a duplication of Gm4 and Gm6 (C1 and C2) as was also
found by Schlueter et al. [49] when sequencing homeologuos BACs anchored by mapped duplicate N-hydroxycinnamoyl benzoyltransferase (HCBT) genes. Other
soybean chromosome duplications we detected included
Gm13-Gm 19 (N and L), Gm8-Gm5 (A2 and A1), Gm13Gm15 (F and E), Gm18-Gm8 (G and A2), Gm2-14 (D1b
and B2), Gm4-Gm6, and Gm11-Gm12 (B1 and H). These
results are consistent with the duplication analysis carried
out by Shoemaker et al. [47] using RFLP markers and the
synteny results of Hisano et al [43], and Tsubokura et al.
[44]. Our study, therefore, confirms results of Shoemaker
et al. [50], showing that compared to common bean, the
soybean genome is the result of a duplicated ancestral
genome that was re-arranged to produce 20 non-homologous chromosomes with many homeologous regions
among chromosome pairs. So far, macro-synteny studies
among other legumes have revealed that the genome
structure is relatively stable within the subfamily Papilionoideae albeit with many of these segmental rearrangements [31,42].

The correspondence of our results with the synteny blocks
(SB) of Cannon et al. [42] appear to be most robust on
B01 and B07 for sequences from SB1 and SB2 (Lj5/Mt1),
on B06 for SB3 (Lj6/Mt2), and on B08 and B02 for SB9
and SB10 (Lj2/Mt5), respectively. Synteny blocks were
also evident in the studies of Young et al. [41] and Hougaard et al. [13]. Meanwhile, Bertioli et al. [32] identified
differences in syntenic blocks between peanut (Arachis
spp.) and Medicago or Lotus, finding that retrotransposonrich regions are distributed in alternating blocks across
these legume genomes and that these are interspersed
between syntenic blocks and correspond to the variable
regions which do not show synteny.

The synteny analysis with Medicago and Lotus compared to
the linkage groups in common bean identified many
more rearrangements. Despite this, chromosomes Lj4 and
Lj2 were found to be related to linkage group B02, Lj4 and
Mt8 to B03, Mt2 and Lj6 to B06, Mt1 to B07, Mt7 and Mt5
to B08, Mt5 to B01 and B02, Mt3 to B09, Lj3 to B10 and
Mt4 to B11. Similar results are reported by Hougaard et al.
[13] who analyzed 99 and 75 shared loci, respectively,
between Lotus or Medicago and common bean and by
Choi et al. [37] who compared various galegoid and phaseoloid genomes using cross species genetic markers.
Results comparing soybean with Lotus by Hisano et al.

Similar results in comparative mapping using ESTs and
gene based markers have allowed the identification of
homologous linkage groups in studies of related Pinus
species [51], or across M. truncatula and M. sativa [31].
Comparative mapping across distantly related species is
also possible with conserved markers used to compare the
sugar beet transcript map with the Arabidopsis genome
[52] or sequence comparisons of Arabidopsis and rice [53]
with a few syntenic blocks always found, suggesting limited co-linearity between distant dicotyledonous or
angiosperm genomes. The long time of divergence (50
Mya) between galegoid and phaseoloid clades [54] would
explain the less frequent homologies between common
bean markers and Lotus or Medicago genomes compared to
hits with the soybean genome. Our results confirm the
reduced level of conservation between galegoid (Medicago, Lotus) and phaseoloid (common bean, soybean) legumes as reported Choi et al. [55] concluding that synteny
is high among closely related species, and that the degree
of synteny declines with increasing phylogenetic distance.

Conclusions
In summary, the SSCP technique in common bean was
found to be a useful alternative marker system for the
genetic analysis of EST-based amplicons and SNP or Indel
based polymorphisms. We reported the versatility of this
technique given its capacity to analyze a wide range of
PCR fragment sizes using simple equipment and standard
conditions. The SSCP technique was especially useful for
saturating the common bean map with gene derived
marker loci, and the resulting transcript map was then

used for macrosynteny analysis with soybean, Lotus and
Medicago genomes. We expect that the EST and gene based
map will be useful for positional cloning and for dissection of quantitative traits, and the identification of the
genes underlying these. In this regard the enhanced map
for DOR364 × G19833 may provide us with the tools for
map-based cloning of QTL for low phosphorus tolerance,
high nutritional quality and other high priority traits discovered by our laboratory for this population
[23,25,56,57]. In addition, the markers will be useful as
tools for marker assisted selection in common bean and
for the further analysis of phylogenetic relationships and
conserved regions between the genome of this crop and
those of model legumes [58]. Furthermore, these results
offer a valuable framework for utilizing sequence information from soybean and model legumes for further
marker development and gene characterization in common bean.

Methods
Plant materials
A parental survey was conducted with the Andean genotypes
(landraces) G19833 and Jalo EEP558 and Mesoamerican
genotypes (varieties) DOR364, BAT93. The Mesoamerican
genotypes DOR364 and BAT93 are both improved lines
from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture
(CIAT) while the Andean genotypes G19833 and Jalo
EEP558 are a landrace from Peru and a released variety from
Brazil, respectively. The molecular mapping was then conducted with the 87 recombinant inbred line (RIL) progeny
from the cross DOR364 × G19833 whose development and
origins are described in Blair et al. [22,35], or Beebe et al.
[25] and which is in the F9:11 generation. The DNAs of the
parents and the RILs were extracted using a CTAB extraction
procedure described in Afanador and Hadley [59].
Marker sources
A total of 418 amplicons were tested for SSCP or Indel polymorphisms, including 56 from primer pairs newly designed
for this study (Additional file 1) based on SNP polymorphisms between Negro Jamapa and G19833 leaf ESTs libraries reported by Ramirez et al. [10], 37 amplicons developed
by our laboratory for EST derived SNPs as described previously [14], 25 SNP based markers from Gaitán-Solís et al.
[11] and 300 "g" markers from North Dakota State University (NDSU) that have been described in the Legume Information System [28]. The development of the new bean SNP
markers (BSNP) was based on conditions for marker design
as given in Galeano et al. [14] with the design of BSNP markers targeting amplification products with an average size of
200 bp that were all smaller than 500 bp based on original
EST contigs from Ramirez et al. [10].
PCR amplification and agarose gel evaluation
All PCR reactions were carried out in 15 μl reaction volumes containing 25 ng of genomic DNA, 0.2 μM each of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/629

forward and reverse primers, 20 mM of total dNTPs, 1×
PCR buffer [10 mM of Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mM of KCl],
2.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. The amplification protocol consisted of 34 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 40
s at 50 to 60°C (depending on the annealing temperature
of each primer as given in Additional file 1), and 2 minutes at 72°C, followed by 5 minutes extension at 72°C.
The PCR products combined 3:1 with loading buffer
(30% glycerol and 0.25% bromophenol blue) were then
run in 0.5× TBE buffer on 2% agarose gels in HORIZON
20:25 gel electrophoresis system units (Gibco BRL Life
Technology Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The gels were
stained with ethidium bromide and visualized on an
ultraviolet trans-illuminator with documentation by a
Gel-Doc 2000 photosystem (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) to confirm amplicon quality, molecular
weights and any observed length polymorphisms.
SSCP marker assay
The PCR products were denatured and separated on SSCP
gels containing a mutation detection enhancement
(MDE) solution as described by Castelblanco and Fregene
[19]. The gel was made up of 6 mL TBE buffer (5×), 39 mL
deionized water and 15 mL MDE gel solution (Cambrex
Biosciences Rockland, Maryland) which was polymerized
by the addition of 0.3 mL ammonium persulphate (10%)
and 30 μL tetramethylenediamine (TEMED). The PCR
product was mixed with 5 μL of loading dye, denatured at
95°C for 5 min, cooled on ice. The electrophoresis run
times were for 4, 10 and 16 h depending on the molecular
weight of the fragment being analyzed. Constant power of
8 W was used to run the gels at room temperature in
Sequi-Gen GT 38 × 30 cm electrophoresis units (Biorad,
Hercules, Calif., USA). Silver staining was performed as
described by Blair et al. [22].
Linkage analysis
Segregation data was used to place the new markers on the
established genetic map for the DOR364 × G19833 population described in Blair et al. [23]. Linkage analysis was
conducted with the Kosambi mapping function using the
software application Mapmaker 2.0 for Windows [60].
The markers were placed to the most-likely interval with
the 'try' command and a minimum LOD of 3.0. Marker
order was then determined by multipoint analysis and
was confirmed with the 'compare' command using a minimum LOD of 4.0. To generate a more reliable map for the
DOR364 × G19833 population, sequence characterized
amplified region (SCAR) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were removed from the matrix
and only the simple sequence repeat (SSR), sequence
tagged site (STS) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers were used as frameworks for the
new EST and gene based SSCP markers. The linkage group
were named as reported in Blair et al. [22] whereby the

naming system from the reference RFLP maps published
by Freyre et al. [61] and Vallejos et al. [62] are combined.
Synteny analysis
Sequences of the SSR, RFLP and new SNP markers were
downloaded in FASTA format from NCBI. The sequences
of the BSNP and g markers were assembled with all available ESTs for common bean (83,448) as of July 2009
using EGassembler [63] to use longer sequences from the
resulting contigs in homology searches. SSR sequences
were masked for simple repeats and low complexity
regions with RepeatMasker, an on-line tool from Institute
for Systems Biology [64]. The sequences were aligned with
an E-value threshold of 1 × 10-10 against the chromosomebased assembly of soybean, Glyma1.0, developed by the
Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute and the
Center for Integrative Genomics [65] using local blastn
that had been downloaded from NCBI. The same process
was used to align markers to the Medicago genome release
version 2.0 [66]. Meanwhile, for Lotus versus common
bean comparisons markers were aligned against the
genome structure reported by Sato et al. [40]. Graphics
were drawn with an in-house software created with Visual
Basic Script programming language in a Microsoft Excel™
environment based on the following information: marker
name, linkage group in common bean and cumulative
distance (in cM) on that linkage group, GenBank accession number or contig name, chromosome in the model
legumes and position (in bp) on that chromosome. Dotplots of marker positions on the genomes of common
bean versus the three other legumes were obtained with
drawing formulas as described by Bertioli et al. [32].
