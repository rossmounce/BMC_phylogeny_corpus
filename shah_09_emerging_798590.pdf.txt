Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression
by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA). Recently, it has been demonstrated that miRNA expression
is altered in many human diseases including cancers, suggesting that miRNA may play a potential
role in the pathogenesis of different diseases. It has also been reported that there is a unique
expression pattern of miRNAs in the disease state differing from the normal state. In this review,
we focus on the miRNA signatures in different human diseases including cancers. Such signatures
may be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers.

Discovery of microRNA
Discovered in 1993 from nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,
miRNA are small, non-coding RNAs composed of 18–24
nucleotides. They act by negatively regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through modulation
of mRNA expression. Lee et al. [1] found that lin-4, an
important gene that is important for post-embryonic
development of C. elegans, does not code for a protein.
Instead, it is transcribed into a 22-nucleotide RNA molecule. Seven years later, a second miRNA, let-7, also
emerged from C. elegans genetic screening. The discovery
of many new miRNAs has continued there after, with evidence emerging to suggest these small RNAs play a crucial
role in gene regulation. This role has been confirmed by
the identification of hundreds of conserved miRNA
sequences in nematodes, flies, and mammals [2].
To date, more than 3% of the genes in humans have been
found to encode for miRNAs. Anywhere from 40% to
90% of the human protein encoding genes are under
miRNA-mediated gene regulation [3]. MiRNAs exert their

effect by negatively regulating gene expression through
one of two mechanisms, i.e., mRNA degradation or translational suppression. The mechanism by which the
miRNA proceeds is dependent on the complementarity
between the miRNA and its mRNA target [4]. A high level
of complementarity corresponds to the degradation of the
target mRNA via the RNA-mediated interference (RNAi)
pathway. When there is inadequate complementarity,
miRNAs bind to the untranslated region of the target
mRNAs and translational suppression occurs through a
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Plants more
commonly utilize the first mechanism while animals
employ the second [2].
MiRNAs play an important role in different biological
process such as cell proliferation during development, cell
growth, and organization as well as apoptosis, biogenesis,
transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle, neurogenesis, and fat metabolism. The deregulation of miRNA function can lead to human diseases as the target genes of
miRNA are involved in several metabolic disorders such

as various forms of cancers, lymphomas, diabetes and
neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Recently, there has been considerable
interest in understanding the mechanism of the RNA regulatory phenomena and how miRNA functions in carcinogenesis. Specifically, determining how the regulation
of miRNA may be targeted to develop cancer therapies has
been a focus. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries
related to miRNA in different cancer diagnoses and, in
particular, treatment related to ovarian cancer (OVCA).

results in perturbation in miRNA genesis and may have
oncogenic consequences.

Biogenesis of miRNA

MiRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases
Neurodegenerative diseases are the result of the deterioration of neurons, which leads to disabilities and the possibility of death. Studies have shown that gene defects play
an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's [6].

Like proteins, miRNAs are transcribed from DNA into a
primary (Pri) RNA transcript. In the first step, formation
of Pri-miRNA inside the nucleus occurs from the transcription of the miRNA gene by RNA polII. The PrimiRNA is capped, polyadenylated, and then processed by
RNAase III endonuclease Drosha and the double stranded
(ds) RNA-binding protein Pasha. This processing results
in the formation of a 60 to 70 nucleotide stem loop precursor (Pre) called Pre-miRNA. The Pre-miRNA is then
transported to the cytoplasm by the Ras-related nuclear
protein-guanosine-5'-triphosphate (RAN-GTP)-dependent export receptor Exportin-5. Next, the Pre-miRNA is
cleaved at the base of the loop by a second RNase III endonuclease, a cytoplasmic Dicer [5]. This forms a transient,
double stranded miRNA (dsmiRNA) of 22 nucleotides in
length. The dsmiRNA complex then enters the miRNAassociated multiprotein RISC (miRISC), which contains
the Argonuate 2 protein, and the mature miRNA is
retained in the miRISC complex [2]. Argonuate proteins
are active RNase enzymes and extremely conserved in the
RISC. The mature miRNA is now capable of regulating its
target mRNAs (See Fig. 1). Deregulation of this processing

Role of miRNAs in disease
Gene regulation by miRNA can affect a wide variety of cell
functions, such as regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. MiRNAs are important for normal
cell functioning; dysfunction of the miRNA regulation system results in disruption of the normal cellular activity
leading to induction of a disease.

Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent age-associated neurodegenerative disorder. Like Alzheimer's disease, gene mutations can result in inherited forms of
Parkinson's disease [7]. Kim et al. [8] suggest that miRNAs
are essential for maintaining the dopaminergic neurons in
the brain. Given that Parkinson's disease is characterized
by an extreme loss of dopaminergic neurons, it could be
possible that miRNAs play a role in the disease pathogenesis. These investigators [8] hypothesized that inducing
alterations in the miRNA networks of the brain results in
neurodegenerative disorders to some extent. Based on the
results of this study and from information obtained in
previous work performed with mice [9], flies [10] and cultured neurons [8] in which the enzyme Dicer was genetically inactivated, Kim et al. [8] concluded that loss of
Dicer results in complete inactivation of miRNA and is tremendously detrimental [11]. Moreover, Dicer was shown
to be important for neuronal survival, as the loss of miRNAs may result in development and/or progression of
Parkinson's disease [8,9].
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common genetic disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of
motor neurons. It has been demonstrated that deletion or
loss-of-function mutations in the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein results in SMA [12]. Gemin 3 and
Gemin 4 are shared components of SMN and miRNAcontaining ribonucleoprotein particles (miRNPs). Deletion or loss-of-function mutations of SMN in SMA may
affect the activity of miRNPs due to possible redistribution or changes in the levels of Gemin 3 and 4.

which several were found to be phylogenetically con-

served. Additionally, several miRNAs that were discovered
to be components of miRNPs in these cells seem to represent distinct subfamilies, all of which contain multiple
copies of these miRNAs on different chromosomes. As
such, it can be proposed that these miRNAs function to
regulate gene expression.
Julie Bilen and colleagues [14] isolated miRNA bantam
(ban) in the genetic screen for the modulators of pathogenecity of the human neurodegenerative disease model
in Drosophila. They demonstrated that upregulation of
ban mitigated degeneration induced by the pathogenic
polyglutamine (polyQ) protein Ataxin 3, which was
mutated in human polyQ disease spinocerebellar ataxia
type 3 (SCA 3). They also showed that loss of all miRNAs
by Dicer mutation dramatically enhances pathogenic
polyQ protein toxicity in flies and human HeLa cells.
These studies suggest that miRNAs may be important for
neuronal survival in relation to neurodegenerative disease.
MiRNAs in heart diseases
The heart responds to chronic and acute injury by hypertrophic growth. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is the dominant cellular response to virtually all forms of
hemodynamic overload, endocrine disorders, myocardial
injury, or inherited mutations in the various structural
and contractile proteins [15]. Multiple genes are aberrantly expressed in hypertrophic cardiac cells. Using
microarray analysis, miRNA expression pattern in hearts
revealed that miR-1, miR-29, miR-30, miR-133, and miR150 have often been found to be down-regulated while
miR-21, miR-125, miR-195, miR-199, and miR-214 are
up-regulated with hypertrophy.

MiR-21 is found to be consistently induced by cardiac
stress and appears to function as a regulator of cardiac
growth and fetal gene activation in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro. Its role in myocyte hypertrophy was demonstrated by Cheng et al. in 2007 [16]. Their study showed
that knockout of miR-21 by an inhibitor suppresses cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II in cell
culture experiments [16]. This indicates that overexpression of miR-21 has a functional role in cardiac hypertrophy. Tatsuguchi et al. [17] also confirmed the role of miR21 in cardiac hypertrophy using locked nucleic acid modified oligos. Recently, Sayed et al. [18] reported that miR21 modulates the cellular outgrowths during hypertrophy
through the regulation of sprouty 2, an intracellular
inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein-kinase signaling.
Another miRNA that is consistently up regulated in rodent
and human hypertrophic hearts is miR-195. Forced
expression of miRNA-195 in transgenic mice is sufficient
to induce hypertrophic growth and also results in dilated
cardiomyopathy and heart failure [19].

http://www.ovarianresearch.com/content/2/1/11

MiR-208 is encoded within intron 27 of the α major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene and plays a key role
in the expression of β MHC in response to cardiac stress
[20]. Although the expression level of miR-208 remains
stable during cardiac stress, this miRNA appears to fulfill
a dominant function in regulating cardiac hypertrophy
and remodeling. In response to pressure overload by thoracic aortic constriction, the knock-out mice show virtually no hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes or fibrosis and are
unable to up regulate the β MHC expression [19]. MiR208 is supposed to act by repressing the expression of a
common component of stress-response and thyroid hormone signaling pathways in the heart, that of the thyroidhormone-receptor (TR) co-regulator TR-associated protein 1 (THRAP1).
MiR-1 is a muscle-specific miRNA that forms a bicistronic
cluster with miR-133. Both miRNAs belong to the same
transcriptional unit and have been found to play a crucial
role in determining when cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
occurs [21]. While both miRNAs are expressed at low levels in the mouse and human models of cardiac hypertrophy, their overexpression can inhibit cardiac hypertrophy.
MiRNAs in diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by defects in insulin
production, secretion, and signaling [22]. Poy et al. [12]
reported that overexpression of miR-375 resulted in suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and its inhibition resulted in enhanced insulin secretion.
Myotrophin, a protein that has a role in exocytosis, was
identified as one of the targets of miR-375. Inhibition of
Myotrophin production has similar effects of miR-375 on
insulin secretion, making miR-375 an important modulator of β-cell function. Keller et al. [23] suggested the additional targets of miR-375 could be the pancreatic
transcription factors pdx-1 and NeuroD1. This indicates
that miR-375 may play important role in interacting with
transcription factors that control pancreatic maintenance
and development [24].

MiRNA and carcinogenesis
Recent studies show that several miRNAs are differentially
expressed in several human cancers, which indicate that
miRNAs may have a role in the carcinogenic processes
(See Table 1). In 2002, Calin et al. [25] correlated aberrant
miRNA expression with cancer. The first study that was
reported regarding the abnormalities in miRNA expression was in miR-15a and miR-16-1 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); [25]. The study showed that
miRNA 15 and miRNA 16 genes are located in a deleted
region present in more than half of B-cell CLL cases and
that both of the genes are deleted/mutated in more than
half of the in CLL cases. In addition, miR-17-92, which is
present as a cluster of miRNAs on chromosome 13, was
reported to be associated with B cell lymphoma [26].

Other miRNAs that have been discovered to be abnormally expressed in cancerous tissues include: miR-145,
which is down regulated in breast cancer [27] ovarian cancer [4]; miR-10b, which is found to be mostly down regulated in breast cancer [27]; and miR-145, which has
reduced expression in colorectal cancer [28].
MiRNAs participate in various biological processes
including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis,
stress resistance, and fat metabolism [29] and often have
dual functions. For instance, in some types of cancers,
they possess oncogenic activity, while in others they can
suppress tumor development. Michael et al. [28] showed
that miR-143 and mi-R-145 have been associated with the
reduction of some malignancies, suggesting their potential tumor suppressing activities. Additional studies demonstrated that miRNAs were found to suppress BCL2, an
anti-apoptotic gene [30]; supporting the idea that miRNA
can also have oncogenic activity. Furthermore, miR-372
and miR-373 cooperate with oncogenic Ras in the cellular
transformation of testicular germ cell tumors [31]. Additionally, in the Let-7 family, Let 7a-2 and Let 7a-3 are
down regulated in lung cancer and Ras is frequently
mutated [32]. Let-7b is involved in Ras regulation and
inhibits cell cycle progression in melanoma [33,34].
MiR-17-92 has been shown to function in embryogenesis
[35] and is overexpressed in lung cancer, especially in
small cell lung cancer, which is characterized by neuroendocrine differentiation. In addition to being overexpressed, there are an increased number of gene copies.
This suggests they have a role in the development of lung
cancer [36]. MiR-34a, which is absent in pancreatic cells,
was directly trans-activated by the p53 gene and proved to
be associated with modulation of gene expression initiated by p53 [37]. C-MYC, a proto-oncogene, encodes for
a transcription factor that is responsible for cell proliferation and growth. A mutation in this gene results in most
common abnormalities associated with human cancers.
Finally, using microarray-based large scale profiling,
Volinia et al. [38] analyzed the miRNA expression pattern
in 540 normal and tumor samples from six types of tissues
(lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, and pancreas).
They proved that the abnormal expression pattern of
many miRNAs is connected to carcinogenesis.

MiRNAs in human ovarian carcinoma (OVCA)
OVCA is the most common of the gynecologic malignancies, but little is known about the molecular genetics of its
initiation and progression. Epithelial OVCA (EOC),

http://www.ovarianresearch.com/content/2/1/11

which accounts for approximately 90% of OVCAs, continues to be the leading cause of death resulting from gynecological malignancies [39]. Histologically, OVCA is
divided into different subgroups such as serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, Brenner, and undifferentiated carcinomas [40]. The high mortality rate of this
disease is due to late stage diagnosis for more than 70% of
affected patients (Chemoresistance). Trans-vaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 remain poor tests for diagnosing the disease in its early stage and, as a result, most cases
are still more likely to be detected at the advanced stage
[41].
New, more effective diagnostic tests must be developed to
identify OVCA in its early stage. If OVCA is diagnosed in
the early stage, current treatments will be more successful,
which in turn will significantly reduce the high mortality
rate. The discovery that miRNAs are expressed at different
levels in normal versus malignant tissues offers the possibility of identifying new methods of diagnosing early
stage incidence and discovering new therapies for the
treatment of OVCA.
With the advent of new miRNA technology, it is possible
to plan appropriate treatments and predict chemotherapy
outcomes. Studies have shown that miRNAs, which are
noncoding regulatory RNA products, are aberrantly
expressed in many cancer types including breast [27], pancreatic [42], and lung cancer [4]. In addition to these
forms, a study conducted by Iorio et al. in 2007, [4] confirmed that miRNAs are also abnormally expressed in
OVCA (See Table 2). It was concluded that in the cancerous tissues, i.e., miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR200c, had the highest level of up-regulation while miR125b, miR-140, miR-145, and miR-199a were the most
down-regulated. Moreover, this study demonstrated that
the levels of expression between the normal and malignant ovaries were so drastic that expression levels alone
could distinctly distinguish between tissue types. This
finding is extremely significant because it points to the
possibility that miRNAs may have oncogenic or tumor
suppressing activities.
In addition to the difference in expression levels between
normal and cancerous tissues, it has been shown that
miRNAs can also be histotype-specific. In endometrioid
tumors, miR-21, miR-182, and miR-205 are considerably
overexpressed while miR-144, miR-222, and miR-302a
have reduced expression compared to normal. However,
in serous and clear cell tumors, these miRNAs are normally expressed [4]. These findings suggest that while all
types of OVCA are currently treated with the same standard therapies, a more effective course of treatment could
be targeted towards specific histotypes of various cancers.

The above tests are invasive procedures because they
require a tissue sample to determine the expression levels
of miRNAs for diagnostic purposes. However, a new noninvasive approach has recently been discovered that only
requires a serum sample from the patient. In the serum of
OVCA patients, miRNAs 21, 29a, 92, 93, and 126 were
overexpressed while miRNAs 127, 155, and 99b were
under expressed as compared to controls. This indicates
that a patient's serum miRNA level could be used to
potentially diagnose OVCA. Additionally, miRNAs 21, 92,
and 93 were also overexpressed in patients with normal
CA125 levels. This suggests that earlier diagnosis of OVCA
may be possible through the identification of these miRNAs even though patients may present with normal CA125 levels [43].
Another new non-invasive method with the potential for
diagnosing OVCA involves isolating tumor-derived exosomes. Exosomes are saucer shaped nanovesicles (30–100
nm) that are normally released by multiple mammalian
cell types and have a significant role in cell-to-cell communication. In addition to exosomes released by normal
proliferating cells, tumor cells also release exosomes.
Tumor cells release exosomes at a much higher level than
normal cells and the exosomes also display numerous
tumor antigens that mirror the primary tumor cells. Therefore, it is proposed that these tumor-derived exosomes
could be used as a diagnostic biomarker. In addition to
the antigens, circulating tumor-derived exosomes have
been shown to contain miRNAs that parallel those of the
original tumor [44]. This demonstrates that miRNA profiling can be executed and accurately represent the originating tumor through a blood sample rather than requiring
the more invasive tissue sample. It has been shown that
eight particular miRNAs are of diagnostic significance in

OVCA. MiRNA 21, 141, 200a, 200b, 200c, 203, 205, and
214 are all overexpressed in tumor cells and tumorderived exosomes. The levels are different enough to
clearly distinguish between benign and malignant tumors
as well [44].
The current treatment utilized for patients with OVCA
consists of primary cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum and taxane combination chemotherapy treatments.
This method of therapy is initially successful; however,
most of the patients become resistant to the platinumbased chemotherapy [45]. Recent studies indicate that
there are significant differences in the level of miRNA
expression between chemotherapeutic sensitive and
resistant OVCA cell lines and tissues. Boren et al. [45]
found that 27 miRNAs were connected to OVCA cell line
sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents
and the differential expression of these miRNAs leads to
chemoresistance. In the cells resistant to the drugs, 18
miRNAs were up-regulated and 9 were down-regulated. It
was determined that increased expression of miR-181a,
miR-181b, and miR-213 in OVCA cell lines results in
resistance to doxorubicin and gemcitabine and increased
expression of miR-99b and miR-14 leads to docetaxel and
paclitaxel resistance. Eitan et al. [46] also discovered several miRNAs that were differentially expressed in stage 3
ovarian tumors. It was established that increased expression of miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-30c, let-7g, and miR199a-3p corresponds to resistance to platinum-based
chemotherapy while reduced expression of miR-378 and
miR-625 relates to resistance.
The difference in miRNA expression levels between chemotherapy-sensitive and resistant cells is clinically significant. New treatments could exploit these differences if the

mechanism behind regulating miRNA expression is determined. Then, for instance, miR-378, which is down-regulated in malignant ovarian tissue, could be induced to
over express to a normal level, possibly making the cells
more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, identification of specific miRNAs between types of
cancers (lung, ovarian, pancreatic) and even within types
(endometrioid, clear cell, serious in ovarian) could allow
for more personalized treatments, which certainly present
the chance for a better prognosis.
While there is not much information currently available
on the mechanisms responsible for inducing aberrant
miRNA expression, there is a new possible explanation for
their overexpression in OVCA. Iorio et al. [4] recently
proved that treating OVCAR3 cells with 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine, a demethylating treatment, results in the overexpression of miR-21, miR-203, and miR-205. These
miRNAs are also up-regulated in ovarian malignant
tumors. This indicates that the mechanism causing their
up-regulation in vivo could be DNA hypomethylation.

Conclusion
The discovery of aberrant miRNA expression between
control patients and those with OVCA holds great promise for improved patient care and more positive outcomes.
Thus, identification of altered miRNA expression, as well
as their targets, provides new opportunities for therapeutic strategies. MiRNA-based gene therapy targeting deregulated miRNAs will be the future tool for cancer
treatment. Using data from miRNA profiling and knowledge of familial history of a certain diseases will help in
developing miRNA-based personalized therapy. Detailed
understanding of the characteristic miRNA abnormalities
could contribute to novel approaches in early diagnosis
and treatment of different diseases including cancer and
can serve as a biomarker for cancer. miRNA expression
profiling eventually assist physicians in providing patients
with accurate diagnosis, personalized therapy, and treatment outcome.
