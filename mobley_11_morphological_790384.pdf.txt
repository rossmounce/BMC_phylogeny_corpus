Morphological and genetic divergence in
Swedish postglacial stickleback (Pungitius
pungitius) populations
Kenyon B Mobley*, Daniel Lussetti, Frank Johansson, Göran Englund and Folmer Bokma

Abstract
Background: An important objective of evolutionary biology is to understand the processes that govern
phenotypic variation in natural populations. We assessed patterns of morphological and genetic divergence among
coastal and inland lake populations of nine-spined stickleback in northern Sweden. Coastal populations are either
from the Baltic coast (n = 5) or from nearby coastal lakes (n = 3) that became isolated from the Baltic Sea (< 100
years before present, ybp). Inland populations are from freshwater lakes that became isolated from the Baltic
approximately 10,000 ybp; either single species lakes without predators (n = 5), or lakes with a recent history of
predation (n = 5) from stocking of salmonid predators (~50 ybp).
Results: Coastal populations showed little variation in 11 morphological traits and had longer spines per unit of
body length than inland populations. Inland populations were larger, on average, and showed greater
morphological variation than coastal populations. A principal component analysis (PCA) across all populations
revealed two major morphological axes related to spine length (PC1, 47.7% variation) and body size (PC2, 32.9%
variation). Analysis of PCA scores showed marked similarity in coastal (Baltic coast and coastal lake) populations.
PCA scores indicate that inland populations with predators have higher within-group variance in spine length and
lower within-group variance in body size than inland populations without predators. Estimates of within-group PST
(a proxy for QST) from PCA scores are similar to estimates of FST for coastal lake populations but PST >FST for Baltic
coast populations. PST >FST for PC1 and PC2 for inland predator and inland no predator populations, with the
exception that PST <FST for body size in inland populations lacking predators.
Conclusions: Baltic coast and coastal lake populations show little morphological and genetic variation within and
between groups suggesting that these populations experience similar ecological conditions and that time since
isolation of coastal lakes has been insufficient to demonstrate divergent morphology in coastal lake populations.
Inland populations, on the other hand, showed much greater morphological and genetic variation characteristic of
long periods of isolation. Inland populations from lakes without predators generally have larger body size, and
smaller spine length relative to body size, suggesting systematic reduction in spine length. In contrast, inland
populations with predators exhibit a wider range of spine lengths relative to body size suggesting that this trait is
responding to local predation pressure differently among these populations. Taken together the results suggest
that predation plays a role in shaping morphological variation among isolated inland populations. However, we
cannot rule out that a causal relationship between predation versus other genetic and environmental influences on
phenotypic variation not measured in this study exists, and this warrants further investigation.

Background
Morphological variation is a ubiquitous phenomenon and
it exists at many taxonomic levels such as between species,
within species and among individuals in populations.
Depending on its relationship to the background environment, morphological variation may be either adaptive or
non-adaptive [1,2]. The degree to which the environment,
phenotypic plasticity, and the underlying genetic architecture interact may also fundamentally influence morphological variation [3-5]. Moreover, divergent morphology is
often associated with speciation events suggesting that
phenotypic variation plays a role in the speciation process
[6,7]. Thus, a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology is
to understand what governs patterns of morphological
variation in natural populations.
In this study we explore patterns of morphological
divergence and the genetic signature of recent isolation
in populations of nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) in northern Sweden. The nine-spined stickleback
is a small euryhaline fish that inhabits a variety of freshwater and brackish environments in the temperate and
subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere [8,9]. In
Sweden, nine-spined sticklebacks are widely distributed
in the Baltic sea (3.5 - 8.8 psu [10]) and inhabit a variety
of freshwater ponds, lakes and rivers [9].
Throughout its range, the nine-spined stickleback displays remarkable morphological variation, particularly in
isolated freshwater populations where morphology
appears to be shaped by a combination of isolation, drift
and natural selection [11-13]. For example, sticklebacks
from landlocked populations are generally larger than
their coastal conspecifics [11]. Also, loss of the pelvic girdle and dorsal, pelvic, and anal spines has been observed
in several isolated populations [8,9,11-16], making it an
excellent model for studies of parallel evolution.
The armour and spines of sticklebacks (Gasterosteidae)
are used primarily as a defence against piscivorous fishes
and many populations retain both characters in the presence of these predators [17]. However there may be a
cost in maintaining such defences in populations lacking
predatory fishes, as reduced armour and spines may aid
escape from invertebrate predators [18,19]. If so, reduction
or loss of these traits should be favoured in populations
where invertebrate predators predominate [16,19,20].
Reversal of the loss of armour has also been shown in
sticklebacks, suggesting that these defensive traits may be
rapidly regained in populations based on the strength of
natural selection experienced [21].
The topology of Scandinavia has been strongly influenced by recent climactic events related to its most recent
deglaciation after the last glacial maximum approximately
11-10,000 calibrated years before present (ybp) [22,23].
Prior to this time, the region was completely covered by
an ice sheet. Fish populations originating from the Baltic

Page 2 of 18

Sea presumably became trapped in lakes and ponds
formed by land uplift soon after the ice-melt [24,25]. In
northern Sweden, nine-spined sticklebacks occur in both
single species lakes and lakes with mixed fish communities
[25]. Recently, predatory fish such as brown trout (Salmo
trutta) and rainbow trout (Onchorynchus mykiss) have
been introduced in a few lakes for recreational angling
purposes, offering an ideal platform to explore the role of
predation on morphological variation in nine-spined
sticklebacks.
There are several goals to the current study. First, we
investigate whether populations of nine-spined sticklebacks show genetic signatures of isolation in inland lakes
and ponds isolated since the last glacial retreat. Here we
investigate patterns of genetic differentiation, genetic variation, and bottlenecking using nine variable microsatellite
loci. The second goal of the study is to investigate morphological divergence between populations that share
common ecological conditions. To this end, we group
populations according to whether they originate from the
Baltic coast, coastal lakes, or inland lakes and ponds with
or without predators. Finally, we explore the potential for
natural selection to affect morphological evolution by
comparing phenotypic divergence with neutral genetic
divergence using a PST - FST approach; an alternative to
Q ST - F ST based on phenotypic variation in natural
populations.

Results
Details concerning the sampling locations and predator
regimes can be found in Table 1 and Figure 1.
Genetic analysis

Summary statistics of microsatellite data per population
are listed in Table 2. Fisher’s exact tests indicated no significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
for any locus in any population after application of a
Bonferroni adjustment to correct for multiple tests [26].
Tests of genotypic disequilibrium between loci were also
non-significant after Bonferroni adjustment, supporting
independent assortment of microsatellite loci. Analysis
using MICROCHECKER detected possible null alleles at
STN19 in GB and RT populations and potential null
alleles or incorrect scoring due to stutter in STN196 in
the RT population. Analysis of loci over all populations
with LOSITAN suggests that loci are putatively neutral
except locus STN196, which may be under positive selection, and STN19, which may be under balancing selection. We reran the LOSITAN analysis excluding inland
populations and these results suggest that all loci in
ancestral coastal populations are neutral.
A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree using DA distances based on all microsatellite data demonstrates that
Baltic coast and coastal lakes cluster together and are

genetically more similar to one another than inland populations with or without predators (Figure 2a). Inland populations showed greater genetic distances, consistent with
longer periods of isolation from coastal populations and
each other (Figure 2a). Bootstrap support for the branching

order of the inland populations is poor, which is in line
with our expectation that these populations all originated
within a short period of time after the last glacial retreat.

differentiation than inland populations. Among coastal
populations, pairwise F ST values were low (range =
-0.005 - 0.026, Table 3) indicating weak population
structuring among these populations. In contrast,
inland populations had high levels of genetic differentiation as evidenced by high pairwise FST values (range
= 0.081-0.677). Pairwise standardized F ST values gave
similar results to pairwise F ST values (Table 3). A
nested within-group comparison between Baltic coast
and coastal lake populations showed no significant differences in FST estimates (P = 1.00). A nested withingroup comparison also shows no significant difference
between F ST estimates between inland lakes with or
without the presence of predators (P = 0.57). However
a significant difference between pooled coastal (coastal
lakes, Baltic coast) and pooled inland (predator, nopredator) F ST estimates is apparent confirming the
visual impression from Figure 2 that inland populations show higher levels of within-population genetic
differentiation (P = 0.001).
Inland populations had lower levels of within-population
genetic variation than coastal populations. In coastal
populations, all nine microsatellite loci were polymorphic,
with 3-8 alleles segregating per locus. Baltic coast and
coastal lake populations showed similar levels of observed
heterozygosity (Ho), allelic richness (A), and gene diversity
(hs) (P = 0.88, P = 0.89, P = 0.97 respectively, Table 4).

Inland populations, on the other hand, had a maximum of
5 alleles segregating per locus and high levels of fixation
ranging from 0-3 loci fixed for a certain allele per population. No two inland populations showed fixation for the
same set of loci. Inland populations had significantly lower
Ho, A and HS than their coastal counterparts (P = 0.01 for
all variables, Table 4) but whether or not an inland population had predators present did not have a significant
influence on either Ho, A, or HS (P = 0.31, P = 0.76, P =
0.47 respectively, Table 4).
We found evidence of recent population-level bottlenecking in two of the 18 populations investigated.
Populations GB and VST both showed a significant heterozygosity deficiency based on our BOTTLENECK
model criteria (Wilcoxon sign rank one tailed test: GB,
P = 0.0137; VST, P = 0.0137). In all other populations
there was no evidence for a departure from mutationdrift equilibrium implying that recent genetic bottlenecking is unlikely to account for reduced levels of
genetic variation in inland populations.
Morphological analysis

Results of the analyses of the 11 morphological characters are summarized by population in Table 5 (See Methods for complete descriptions of morphological
characters). Mean estimates of body length (SL) were
highest for the inland populations without predators, but

did not differ significantly from the other groups (Figure
3). Relative measures of head depth (per unit of standard
length, SL-1) demonstrate that inland populations (with
and without predators) have the most divergent morphology while coastal populations (Baltic coast, coastal
lakes) show intermediate values for this trait (Figure 3).
Relative head-eye length, on the other hand, show Baltic

coast and inland lake without predator populations to
have the most divergent morphology, with coastal lakes
and inland lake - predator populations having intermediate values (Figure 3). Relative estimates of spine length
(pelvic, anal, anterior dorsal, middle dorsal, posterior dorsal, girdle length and girdle width) consistently demonstrate significantly longer spines (SL -1 ) in coastal

Number of populations (n), observed heterozygosity (HO), allelic richness (A), gene diversity (hs) and FST values are listed for each group for all nine microsatellite
loci. Within-group PST estimates with 95% confidence intervals for PC1 (body size) and PC2 (spine length) and c/h2 critical value (assuming h2 = 0.4) with
conservative 95% confidence limit are also listed. Asterix denotes h2/c critical value for the instance where PST <FST. na = not applicable.

populations than in inland populations (Figure 3). The
one measured meristic character, the number of dorsal
spines, was variable in all populations with a mean of 910 spines (range 8-11) for all populations except BN,
which had a mean of five spines (range 1-10) (Table 5).
However, this character was not significantly different
between groups (Figure 3).
A cluster analysis based on population means across
all 11 morphological characters demonstrated strikingly
similar morphology between Baltic coast and coastal
lake populations (Figure 2b). Inland populations showed
greater divergence in morphology than coastal populations (Figure 2b). Although there is some morphological
clustering among inland populations that share similar
predation regimes, there is also clustering of populations
that have disparate predation regimes, suggesting that
overall phenotypic appearance may evolve independently
in these populations (Figure 2b).
Results of the principal components analysis (PCA)
showed that the first two principal components had Eigenvalues greater than one and explained a combined 80.6%
of the total variation of the full data. Therefore only these
two axes were used in subsequent analyses. Principal components axis 1 (PC1) represented 47.7% of the variance
and had high loading scores (> 0.40) for pelvic spine
length, anal spine length, and all dorsal spine lengths after
varimax rotation (Table 6). Principal components axis 2
(PC2) represented 32.9% of the variance and had high
loading scores for standard length, head depth, head
length, and pelvic girdle width (Table 6). Therefore, PC1
corresponds to a “spine length” function while PC2 corresponds to a “body size” function. Only pelvic girdle length
had high loading scores for both PC1 and PC2 (Table 6).
Visualization of the PCA results reveals tight clustering
of Baltic coast and coastal lakes in PC space (Figure 4),
confirming their morphological similarity. Inland populations, on the other hand, showed much greater variation
than coastal populations. Inland populations without predators showed greater variation in PC2 scores than in
PC1 scores and the opposite is true for inland predator
populations (Figure 3). Thus, the introduction of predators in inland populations appears to have reduced variation in body size, accompanied by an increase in the
variability of spine length (Figure 4).

To test whether variation in PC scores differs significantly between groups and populations nested within
groups, we constructed a nested multivariate analysis of
variance (MANOVA) on PC1 and PC2. Our results
show strong support for morphological divergence
among groups and significant differences between populations nested within groups (Table 7).
PST - FST comparisons within groups

Within-group estimates of neutral genetic divergence
(FST) and phenotypic divergence (PST) in Baltic coast and
coastal lake groups demonstrated low estimates for each
measure (Table 4, Figure 5). The Baltic coast group had
PST >FST with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals
for both PC1 and PC2 suggesting that divergent selection
on both spine length and body size is occurring in populations of this group. Coastal lake PST estimates, on the
other hand, had overlapping 95% confidence intervals
with FST (Table 4, Figure 5) which suggests that within
this group, one cannot distinguish between the effects of
natural selection and genetic drift on phenotypic appearance. Within the inland no predator group, we found PST
<F ST for PC1 indicating stabilizing selection on spine
length and the opposite trend, namely PST >FST for PC2,
suggesting divergent selection in body size in this group
(Table 4, Figure 5). Finally, inland populations with predators show PST >FST for PC1 and PC2 suggesting divergent selection on spine length and body size, but
estimates of PST are more variable than any other estimate and confidence intervals overlap FST values, making
a judgement as to whether natural selection or genetic
drift is operating equivocal (Table 4, Figure 5).
To test whether our measures of PST are a robust and
fair measure of QST, we investigated the estimate of the
critical c/h 2 ratio [27] for both PC1 and PC2 in cases
where P ST >F ST and the inverse relationship (i.e. h 2 /c
ratio) when PST <FST. Low values of these ratios indicate
more robust support for PST to approximate QST in their
various scenarios [27]. If we assume that body size is moderately heritable so that h2 = 0.4 (see Discussion), and
because c cannot exceed unity, using the lower 95% confidence limit for PST in cases where PST >FST yields low
values of c/h2 critical values of 0.200 and 0.287 for Baltic
coast populations PC1 and PC2 respectively (Table 4).

low c/h2 critical value of 0.125 was found in inland no predator group for PC2 also demonstrating a robust signature

of divergent selection within this group. Under the one
instance where PST <FST in inland no predator PCI, the
h2/c ratio was low at 0.283 and we may conclude that QST
<FST, i.e. a signal of convergent evolution/stabilizing selection on spine length in inland populations without
predators.

Our results support the hypothesis that inland populations of nine-spined sticklebacks were isolated from
coastal populations following the recent deglaciation of
the Baltic Sea. Our first line of support for this hypothesis
comes from the physical location of these sites which
were among the first areas to be exposed after the retreat
of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet circa 11 - 10 k cal. ybp
[22,23]. A plausible scenario is that these populations originated from Baltic stock and were isolated as the land
uplifted from glacial rebound forming lakes and ponds
[24,25]. Additional support for this hypothesis is venerated by the observation that few natural populations of

Discussion
In this study, we used molecular and morphological data
to quantify differentiation between populations from
coastal areas of the Baltic Sea and inland populations that
have been isolated since the last deglaciation. In general,
we find that Baltic coast and coastal lake populations are
similar genetically and morphologically. Inland populations, on the other hand, show greater genetic and morphological divergence. The recent introduction of
predators into some inland populations also appears to
have altered the evolution of body shape and spine length
as inland populations with predators varied considerably
in spine length but showed much greater conservatism in
body size than inland populations without predators.
Taken together, these results suggest that nine-spined
stickleback populations in northern Sweden are strongly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/287

nine-spined sticklebacks are found in northern Sweden
above or below the highest coastline exposed after the
last glacial maximum [28].
In agreement with the hypothesis for isolation of inland
populations, we found lower levels of genetic differentiation, as measured by Nei’s DA, FST and standardized FST,
in coastal sites and very high levels of genetic differentiation including the fixation of different alleles in many
inland populations. Accordingly, we found higher levels
of genetic variation as measured by H O , π, and h s in
coastal populations than in inland populations. These last
two findings are consistent with a pattern of isolation and
genetic differentiation of populations through genetic
drift and/or founder effects. Based on our results, these
decreases in HO do not appear to be due to a recent bottleneck in inland populations, with the exception of VST
where significant results of simulated genetic bottlenecking were detected. We also found that populations from
coastal lakes appear to be genetically indistinguishable
from those emanating from the Baltic Sea, suggesting a
separation so recent that genetic differences have yet to
become apparent. These results strongly suggest that
coastal populations are closely related whereas inland
populations have existed in isolation for quite some time,
and that genetic drift is responsible for the divergence in
allelic frequencies and fixation of certain alleles.
Our support for a reduction in genetic variability among
inland populations echoes findings in freshwater populations of the closely related three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that generally have reduced genetic
variability [29-31] as a result of isolation from presumably
ancestral anadromous populations [32]. Similar models for
post-glacial colonization by nine-spined sticklebacks have
also been proposed and confirmed for North American
populations [8,33]. A recent study of nine-spined sticklebacks by Shikano and colleagues demonstrated similar
patterns of isolation from anadromous ancestral populations of this species in Europe [9]. In their study, coastal
populations from the Baltic sea had high levels of genetic
variation as measured by allelic richness and heterozygosity when compared to populations from freshwater
systems near the Baltic while higher levels of genetic differentiation, as measured by FST and DA, were prevalent in
freshwater but not in coastal populations [9]. The authors
concluded that these patterns of genetic variation and
genetic differentiation are consistent with postglacial recolonization of freshwater habitats, and subsequent isolation
reducing variation in these populations through genetic
drift and founder effects. Since Shikano and colleagues’
study encompassed sampling from a much larger geographic area than studied here, it appears that this pattern
of isolation is common in the Baltic region and that recent
glacial history has greatly affected the current distribution
of these fishes.

Morphological divergence

Our results show many morphological similarities
between Baltic coast and coastal lake populations of
nine-spined sticklebacks, mirroring the pattern of low
levels of genetic differentiation. Given that coastal lakes
have been isolated from the Baltic due to land uplift over
a relatively short period of time (< 100 yrs), it is not surprising that there has been little differentiation in morphology compared to the relatively greater morphological
divergence in inland populations. Moreover, piscivorous
fish such as pike and perch are not currently detected in
two of the three coastal lakes [28] but were likely present
in these habitats prior to and during lake formation.
Therefore morphological divergence in the absence of
predation may be expected in these populations in the
future, but perhaps not over the short time since isolation from the Baltic.
Inland populations of nine-spined sticklebacks displayed
higher morphological diversity as compared to coastal
populations. We also found evidence of morphological differences in both body size and spine length with respect to
the presence of fish predators. Additionally, we found
highly divergent morphological variation in some inland
populations. For example, the populations with the two
most divergent morphologies, BN and RT, show the greatest differences in mean body size. The BN population also
has a reduction in the number of dorsal spines and dorsal
spine length, and all but one individual completely lacked
pelvic spines. This pattern of pelvic spine loss and an overall reduction in spines has been demonstrated in several
species of stickleback [16,19,34] and may be due to an ecological escape from predation pressure, an ion deficiency
related to calcification and bone deposition and/or
increased invertebrate predation pressure in these populations [16,20,35].
Nine-spined sticklebacks that exist in ponds where they
are the only fish species can obtain much larger body sizes
than their coastal counterparts, presumably because of the
absence of fish predation combined with interspecific
competition for resources and/or fecundity selection
[11,12]. Confirming this prediction, we observed a trend
for individuals hailing from inland populations without
predators to be larger, on average, than both Baltic populations and inland lakes with predators. A similar pattern
of larger size encountered in populations that either lack
predators or have non-gape limited predators has been
shown in three-spined sticklebacks [36] and brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans) [37], strongly suggesting that
predation limits body size in this and other species of
sticklebacks.
Despite having a smaller range in body size than their
counterparts that hail from predation-free lakes, ninespined sticklebacks from predator lakes have much greater
variation in spine length. Although spine lengths are

Mobley et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:287
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/287

significantly smaller in inland populations compared to
coastal populations, there is a trend for inland populations
with predators to show longer spines (per unit of body
length), on average, than inland populations without predators. The implication, therefore, is that spine length has
increased in these populations as a result of the recent
introduction of predatory fish. However the great variation
in spine length exhibited among these populations within
this group suggest that these populations may be responding to predation pressure differently. This great variation
spine length could be caused by differing predation
regimes within these lakes due to differences in predator
communities, population densities of predators, differences in the relative exposure time to predators, and/or
the recent extinction of predators within at least one lake.
Although our results strongly suggest a role of predation,
we cannot rule out that other ecological factors not measured in this study such as water chemistry may affect
morphological variability in predator lakes.
PST - FST comparisons

Quantitative comparisons between morphological and
neutral genetic divergence as estimated by Q ST - F ST ,
have been used as metric to investigate the potential for
natural selection to influence morphological variation in
many populations or species [38,39]. The analogous comparison based solely on phenotypic data (i.e., PST - FST)
has been highly criticized, particularly because it is difficult to tease apart the variance in phenotype attributable
to environmental or genetic effects in wild populations.
Thus, some advocate that QST - FST comparisons should
only be performed under controlled conditions in common garden experiments [40]. While such approaches
are preferable, we argue that there can be some value to
PST - FST comparisons in natural populations. For example, in a recent meta-analysis that compared estimates of
QST - FST from different types of studies, estimates of PST
from wild populations do not yield higher estimates than
studies that use either broad or narrow sense estimates of
additive genetic variation [39]. Secondly, studies of PST in
wild populations show meaningful variance among populations where a common garden approach may not be
easily applied [27,29,41]. For example, in order to quantify additive genetic variation in our study of 18 natural
populations with all potential crosses and multiple family
groups taken to the F2 generation would be a feat of herculean proportions in terms of time, scale and expense.
Finally, in light of the criticism of PST as a substitute for
QST, it should also be kept in mind that common garden
estimates of QST may be inappropriate to compare to FST
because the genetic basis of the phenotypes on which
selection may potentially act may be partly genetic but
non-additive (i.e. epigenetic), or environment-dependent.
Thus we believe that P ST - F ST studies in natural

Page 13 of 18

populations do have some merit although we advocate
caution in its interpretation.
Acknowledging the aforementioned concerns, we compared PST estimates for both spine length (PC1) and body
size (PC2) within groups to estimate the relative influence
of natural selection and genetic drift on the evolution of
morphological phenotypic variation within our groups of
interest. Despite the great morphological similarity within
the Baltic coast group, it demonstrated PST >FST in both
spine length and body size. Given the high gene flow
experienced within this group, the most likely explanation
is that these slight morphological differences could be
explained by phenotypic plasticity in response to local
environmental variation. However it should be noted that
our FST estimates are so low that any variation in morphology would likely be greater than genetic divergence
and so this result should be viewed cautiously. In coastal
lakes, PST ≈ FST for these estimates making distinctions
between selection and genetic drift equivocal. In inland
lakes without predators, we found a robust FST - PST pattern of convergent evolution and stabilizing selection on
reduced spine length strongly suggesting that reduced
spine length is advantageous in single species lakes, potentially to aid escape of fish from invertebrate predators. A
robust pattern of divergent selection and local adaptation
on body size is also evident in inland no-predator lakes.
Finally, great variation in body size and spine length within
the inland predator group may also be indicative of divergent selection on these traits in these populations but confidence intervals are wide making a realistic determination
difficult. Taken together, these results show opposite and
robust patterns of convergent versus divergent selection
on spine length based on the presence or absence of predation, strongly implicating the recent exposure to predators as a significant factor shaping phenotypic differences
between these populations.
The degree to which our main focal phenotypic characters, body size and spine length, differ in their phenotypic
response to selection is not currently known in nine-spined
stickleback but may vary among different populations due
to different environment conditions and standing levels of
genetic variation [3,5]. Studies on other fish species show
that fish predators potentially can induce phenotypic
changes in body shape and morphology without necessarily
changing the background genetic structure [42-44]. For
example, one study showed that cues of a predatory fish
induced a deeper body and longer dorsal spines in a sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) [43]. The genetic component of the
traits studied here remain unknown as previous studies
investigating genetic differences among populations of
nine-spined stickleback using a common-garden approach
have not yet reported heritablities for these traits [13,45].
Among three-spined sticklebacks, morphological traits of
predator-naive and predator-sympatric populations

Mobley et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:287
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/287

demonstrate high values of heritability for body shape (h2 =
0.67, 0.94) and length (h2 = 0.92, 0.82) and moderate values
for relative spine length (h2 = 0.34, 0.39) [46]. Other studies
of three-spined sticklebacks have shown that body size is
moderately heritable (h2 = 0.42) [47] or that heritability
may vary from negligible (h2 = 0.007) to moderate (h2 =
0.313) due to environmental factors such as rearing salinity
[5]. Taken together, these results suggest that in most cases
morphological traits such as body size and spine length are
moderately to highly heritable in three-spined sticklebacks,
but that the ratio between genetic and environmental variance (and hence the heritability) may not be equal across
populations.

Conclusions
Understanding the causes underlying morphological differences between populations is a fundamental question
in evolutionary biology. Our power to explore differences
in morphology among inland populations with disparate
predation regimes is significantly enhanced by our
knowledge of predator stocking and ‘fisher knowledge’
based on over 100 years of data collection within inland
lakes. Our two findings that 1) fish hailing from inland
no predator lakes appear to be convergent selection on
small spine length and divergent selection on body size
and 2) fish from predator lakes have a highly variable
response in spine length and body size strongly suggests
that the recent introduction of salmonids in these lakes
have influenced morphology in nine-spined sticklebacks
in these populations. However, our current study cannot
determine whether additional factors such as water
chemistry [20,35] and invertebrate predation [18] can
contribute to phenotypic variation in our populations of
stickleback. Additionally, the amount of environmental
variation and heritability of phenotypic traits within and
between populations is outside of the scope of this study
but certainly warrant additional investigation along these
lines. This research also highlights the importance of
studying morphological and genetic variation on a fine
ecological scale in order to determine the environmental
factors responsible for shaping the shared and unique
features of evolutionary histories.
Methods
Study area

Field sampling of nine-spined stickleback populations
occurred during May - August 2007 and June 2008 in the
counties of Västerbotten and Västernorrland, northern
Sweden (Table 1, Figure 1). In total, 18 locations were
visited including eight populations from the Baltic Sea
coast consisting of five populations from coastal bays
(Baltic coast) and three populations from lakes situated
within a km of the Baltic Sea (coastal lakes). An additional 10 populations were sampled from inland lakes

Page 14 of 18

and ponds that have been isolated from the Baltic Sea for
more than 9000 cal. ybp (Figure 1). Of the 10 inland
lakes and ponds, five are single species lakes where ninespine sticklebacks are the only fish species recorded
(inland - no predators, Table 1). Stickleback populations
in the remaining five inland lakes and ponds have a
known history of predation (inland - predators). Predators such as brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have been stocked in these
lakes for recreational angling purposes. Records show
that these lakes (except HM) have been stocked as early
as 1959 and many have been stocked extensively in the
1980s and 1990s (Table 1). No records of the presence of
these fish precede the known stocking dates. Records
indicate that one of our sampling sites (SKT) was stocked
with brown and rainbow trout in 1985, but surveys after
2000 indicate that these introduced species are no longer
present in this lake. Nevertheless, this lake was classified
as a predator lake based on the very recent exposure to
predation.
The selection of locations was based on information in
the PIKE Database [28]. The database contains records
of fish community composition and introductions for
more than 19,000 Swedish lakes. Information about fish
species is based on interviews with local fishermen and
surveys using a minimum of eight minnow traps and/or
four multi-mesh gill net sets (bottom set, monofilament
nylon and measured 30 × 1.5 m with mesh size ranging
between 5 and 55 mm) [48].
Fish collection and morphological measurements

Adult nine-spined sticklebacks were caught using baited
minnow traps and landing nets. Fish were immediately
placed on ice and transported to the laboratory for
genetic and morphological analyses. There, specimens
were defrosted and morphological traits were measured
with a digital calliper. Traits measured included standard length (SL, tip of snout to tip of caudal peduncle),
head depth (top of head to bottom of head through centre of eye perpendicular to SL), head-eye length (top of
head to centre of eye perpendicular to SL), length of
pelvic spine, length of anal spine, and length of anterior,
middle and posterior dorsal spine (Figure 6a). The total
number of dorsal spines was also counted. For individuals with even numbers of dorsal spines, middle dorsal
spine length was an average of the length of the two
middle spines. After measurements were taken, the right
pelvic fin (or the caudal fin in the BN population) was
clipped for genetic analyses, and individual fish were
stained in order to measure the pelvic girdle.
To prepare the staining of the pelvic girdle, fish were
first fixed according to the following scheme: 95% EtOH
for 24 h, 70% EtOH for 24 h, 50% EtOH for 24 h, 20%
EtOH for 24 h and 24 h in distilled H 2 O. Fish were

then transferred to a 0.4 g/l aqueous solution of KOH
containing 0.425 g of Alizarin red to stain bony parts.
Fish were kept in the solution for 3 h and were then
transferred to 0.4 g/l aqueous solution of KOH without
dye. After 24 h, fish were placed in 50% iso-propanol
for long-term storage. After staining, the length and
width of the pelvic girdle was measured using callipers
(Figure 6b).
Microsatellite analysis

Total genomic DNA was extracted from finclips of all individuals in each sampled location using a DNeasy ® Blood
& Tissue Kit (product #69581, Quigen, Valencia, USA).
Nine polymorphic microsatellite markers (Pbbe1125,
Stn19, Stn49, Stn96, Stn148, Stn163, Stn173, Stn196,
Stn198) previously used to characterize P. pungitius [49]
were individually labelled with florescent primers. Microsatellite markers were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a 10 μl reaction using a multiplex PCR kit
(Qiagen Inc.). PCR conditions for each reaction using the
multiplex kit were 5 μl of Qiagen Master Mix (containing
HotStarTaq DNA polymerase, dNTPs and 3 mM MgCl2),
0.625 μM of each primer, and 3 μl of genomic DNA. Temperature profile for thermal cycling: 96°C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 90 sec, 72°C
for 90 sec, and a final 20 min extension at 72°C. Fragment
lengths of PCR products were analyzed using CEQ™ 800
Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea,
USA).
Microsatellite data were analyzed with ARLEQUIN v.
3.11 [50] to test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Fisher’s exact test) and for genotypic disequilibrium for
pairs of loci within populations (Fisher’s exact test). Loci
were checked the scoring errors and the presence of

Page 15 of 18

null alleles using MICROCHECKER v 2.2.3 [51]. We
also tested all loci for neutrality using the program
LOSITAN using a multi-step mutation model and
10,000 replicates of data collection [52,53].
A single microsatellite locus, Stn49 showed a mutation
consisting of a one base pair insertion. This mutation is
common in eastern European lineages of P. pungitius [9]
and it was included in all subsequent analyses except for
analyses conducted with MICROCHECKER, LOSITAN,
and BOTTLENECK because this locus does not follow a
typical dinucleotide stepwise mutation pattern [9].
Nei’s genetic distance (DA) [54] was used to construct a
phylogeny based on microsatellite data for the 18 ninespined stickleback populations using the program POPULATIONS v. 1.2.30 [55]. Levels of bootstrap support were
obtained from 10,000 replicates and the resulting neighbour-joining tree was drawn with POPULATIONS.
Genetic differentiation, as measured by FST [56], was calculated between each population pair with ARLEQUIN.
Significance of global pairwise FST values was estimated
with ARLEQUIN using 10,000 permutations. In order to
compare measures of genetic differentiation corrected for
differences between populations with different levels of
allelic richness and heterozygosity, we calculated standardized FST values with GENODIVE v. 2.0b18 [57].
We tested for differences in within-group genetic variation (Baltic coast, coastal lakes, inland lakes with or without predators) and between coastal (pooled Baltic coast,
coastal lakes) and inland lakes (pooled predators, no predators). Our estimates of genetic variation included
observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He)
allelic richness (A), and global FST values with FSTAT v
2.9.3.2 [58] using the “comparison among groups of samples” subfunction. Significance was ascertained for these
parameters over 10,000 permutations.
To investigate whether populations bear the signature of
a recent fluctuation in population size, we investigated
heterozygosity deficiency and heterozygosity excess with
respect to gene diversity using the program BOTTLENECK v. 1.2.02 with 1,000 replications of a two-phase
mutation model [59]. The two-phase model of mutation
consisted of mostly of one-step changes with a low percentage of multistep changes (9:1), recommended by Di
Rienzo et al. [60] for microsatellites.

coast, coastal lakes, inland no predators, inland predators)
using a general linear mixed model (GLMM) using group
as a fixed factor and population nested within group as a
random factor to ascertain whether groups significantly
differed in standard length and the number of dorsal
spines. All remaining morphological measurements were
first divided by standard length to obtain a relative

morphological measurement per unit of standard length
(SL-1) prior to GLMM analysis. A Tukey-Kramer honestly
significant difference post-hoc analysis was conducted
to determine which groups gave rise to significant
differences.
A morphological cluster analysis was conducted on
population means of all 11 morphological characters
including the number of dorsal spines. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on 10 morphological characters (excluding the meristic character) and a
varimax rotation [61] was applied to all components
that had Eigenvalues greater than 1. A nested multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was then used to
test for differences in morphological PC axes between
all groups, with populations nested within groups. Since
many individuals in the BN population lacked dorsal,
pelvic and anal spines or had highly reduced spine
lengths and therefore may have contributed a disproportionate amount of variation to the PCA, we constructed
the PCA and all subsequent analyses with and without
the BN population. However, all significant differences
in MANOVAs between groups were detected irrespective of whether BN was included, so we present only the
results with BN included.
Calculation of PST

In can be shown that (for diploid species, assuming
purely additive gene action) the quantity
QST =

VA,b
VA,b + 2VA,w

(where VA, b and VA, w are the morphological additive
genetic variance components between and within populations) is expected to take the same value as FST calculated from the genes that determine the trait [62,63].
Hence, if FST is calculated from neutral markers such as
the microsatellites we analyzed, then for a quantitative
trait under divergent selection QST >FST and under stabilizing or convergent selection QST <FST. Unfortunately,
the common garden experiments needed to estimate the
additive genetic variance components of a character are
difficult to realize for many species. Therefore, QST is
often approximated by PST, which is calculated directly
from the total phenotypic (i.e. combined genetic and
environmental) variance components [64]:
PST =

Vb
Vb + 2Vw

Obviously, how well P ST approximates QST depends
on whether the total phenotypic variance within and
between populations reflects the additive genetic variance. The heritability h2 relates the additive variance
within a population to the total variance: VA, w = h2 Vw.

Page 16 of 18

We can similarly envision a “population level heritability” c so that VA, b = c Vb. If we are willing to make the
simplifying assumptions that both h2 and c are equal for
all populations, then [27,63]:
QST =

cVb
cVb + 2h2 Vw

Algebraic rearrangement then yields the relation
between QST and PST expressed as a simple function of
the ratio c/h2:
PST

QST =
PST

c
+ 2
h

−1

(1 − PST )

Thus, we can calculate PST and evaluate which value
the ratio c/h2should take for QST to equal FST, that is:
FST (PST − 1)
c
=
h2 PST (FST − 1)

In other words, if for some trait we find that PST <FST,
we can calculate which ratio c/h2 would generate this
result when in fact QST = FST. In the reverse situation
when PST >FST, we can take the inverse of the c/h2 ratio
(i.e., h2/c) to test the robustness of our estimates. If the
required ratio is extreme, i.e. c < <h2 we may be confident that the conclusion based on a PST - FST comparison would not be altered if we had estimated Q ST
directly. Therefore, we report “uncorrected” values of
P ST in the results, and use the above formula when
interpreting the robustness of our results.
To calculate PST, we partitioned phenotypic variance
in within- and between population components by
ANOVA (assuming unequal variances) in Matlab (version 7.5, MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). We
then calculated the within-group mean pairwise PST of
all pairs of populations. If there are n populations in the
group, there are n (n-1)/2 pairs of populations. For
example, for the n = 5 coastal bay populations, PST is
calculated as the mean of 10 pairs of populations. For
between-group PST we calculated the mean pairwise PST
of all pairs of populations where each pair consists of a
population from the one group and a population from
the other group. If there are n1 populations in the one
group and n2 populations in the other, there are n1 n2
between-group pairs. Because each population is part of
several pairwise comparisons in the calculation of PST,
we used bootstrapping to calculate 95% confidence
intervals.
Unless otherwise noted, all statistical tests were performed with JMP IN™ statistical software package version 7.0 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Means are reported throughout text as ± one standard
error of the mean (SE).
