Cross species comparison of C/EBPa and PPARg
profiles in mouse and human adipocytes reveals
interdependent retention of binding sites

Abstract
Background: The transcription factors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor g (PPARg) and CCAAT/enhancer
binding protein a (C/EBPa) are key transcriptional regulators of adipocyte differentiation and function. We and
others have previously shown that binding sites of these two transcription factors show a high degree of overlap
and are associated with the majority of genes upregulated during differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
Results: Here we have mapped all binding sites of C/EBPa and PPARg in human SGBS adipocytes and compared
these with the genome-wide profiles from mouse adipocytes to systematically investigate what biological features
correlate with retention of sites in orthologous regions between mouse and human. Despite a limited interspecies
retention of binding sites, several biological features make sites more likely to be retained. First, co-binding of
PPARg and C/EBPa in mouse is the most powerful predictor of retention of the corresponding binding sites in
human. Second, vicinity to genes highly upregulated during adipogenesis significantly increases retention. Third,
the presence of C/EBPa consensus sites correlate with retention of both factors, indicating that C/EBPa facilitates
recruitment of PPARg. Fourth, retention correlates with overall sequence conservation within the binding regions
independent of C/EBPa and PPARg sequence patterns, indicating that other transcription factors work
cooperatively with these two key transcription factors.
Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of what biological features impact on
retention of binding sites between human and mouse. Specifically, we show that the binding of C/EBPa and
PPARg in adipocytes have evolved in a highly interdependent manner, indicating a significant cooperativity
between these two transcription factors.

Background
The adipose tissue plays a central role in maintaining
whole body lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as insulin sensitivity [1,2]. Adipocytes are derived from fibroblastic precursors in the adipose tissue through a tightly
regulated differentiation process. The molecular basis for
the regulation of adipogenesis has been studied extensively
in vitro using a variety of preadipocyte cell culture models.
In particular, studies of the 3T3-L1 cell line derived from

mouse embryo fibroblasts [3] have been valuable for gaining insight into the ordered cascade of molecular events
required for adipogenesis [4-6]. More recently, human cell
culture models have become available including the SGBS
cell line derived from preadipocytes from a patient with
Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome [7].
The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPARg) is a key regulator of adipogenesis,
required for in vitro as well as in vivo differentiation of
adipocytes [8,9]. In addition to PPARg, a number of other
important transcriptional regulators of adipocyte differentiation have been identified [6], including members of the
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family [10-12].
C/EBPa is induced late in adipocyte differentiation and is
known to cooperate with PPARg in induction of at least a
subset of adipocyte-specific genes. In addition, these two

factors induce the expression of each other [13,14]. Two
other members of the C/EBP family, C/EBPb and -δ, are
directly involved in the transcriptional induction of PPARg
and C/EBPa [6].
We recently used chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) combined with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to
generate genome-wide maps of the binding sites of
PPARg and its heterodimerization partner retinoid ×
receptor (RXR) during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes [15]. In addition, we profiled RNA polymerase II
(RNAPII) occupancy to measure active transcription at
different time points during differentiation. This study
revealed that PPARg:RXR binding was highly enriched
in the vicinity of genes upregulated during adipogenesis.
In fact, the majority (75%) of all highly up-regulated
genes have PPARg:RXR binding in the immediate vicinity [15]. Similarly, Lazar and colleagues [16] and others
[17,18] used ChIP in combination with hybridization to
genomic tiling microarrays (ChIP-chip) or cloning followed by sequencing (ChIP-PET) to map PPARg binding
sites in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (reviewed in [19]). Intriguingly, these studies have revealed that the C/EBPa consensus site is highly over-represented under the binding
regions of PPARg. Lazar and colleagues profiled C/EBPa
binding sites in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes and found a
remarkable overlap between C/EBPa and PPARg binding (> 60% of all PPARg sites) on a genome-wide scale
[16]. Importantly, 60% of the genes induced during adipogenesis have both C/EBPa and PPARg binding sites
within 50 kb of a transcription start site (TSS), and
knockdown studies indicated that both C/EBPa and
PPARg are required for robust gene expression of a few
selected adipocyte specific target genes. Cumulatively,
these results indicate that both PPARg and C/EBPa are
directly involved in the activation of the majority of adipocyte-specific genes and that they cooperate through
binding to adjacent sites on DNA.
Genome-wide profiling has also made it possible to
study the evolution of gene regulation by mapping the
sites for the same transcription factors in different species. This is typically done by aligning genomes of the
two species and tabulating the number of detected sites
in one species that are in the corresponding region in
the other species. This means that a genomic region
might be highly conserved in terms of nucleotides but
may or may not bind the transcription factor in question in both species. To distinguish between genome
sequence conservation and transcription factor binding
site conservation, we will use the word “retention” to
describe binding sites that are present in both species in
the corresponding genomic region.
Notably, whereas the functional gene targets of a particular transcription factor are generally well conserved
between species, it has been shown that the majority of

Page 2 of 16

binding sites for all transcription factors investigated to
date are species-specific [20-25], reviewed in [26]. This is
surprising given that sequence conservation has been successfully used to enhance regulatory site prediction in
proximal promoters (phylogenetic foot printing) [27,28];
however, this might reflect that these older studies were
focused on limited sets of sites often located in tissuespecific promoters, while genome-wide methods, such as
ChIP-seq, are independent of previous annotations. Consistent with the species specificity of transcription factor
binding sites, Rosen and colleagues recently compared
PPARg binding in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in vitro differentiated primary human adipose stromal cells (hASC), and
found that only 21.3% of the murine binding sites were
retained in human adipocytes. By contrast, the association
of PPARg with adipocyte gene regulation appeared to be
better retained than the specific binding sites, and the
overall gene expression profiles were well conserved [21].
Rosen and colleagues also showed that genes associated
with a conserved PPARg binding site are more likely to be
upregulated during adipogenesis than genes associated
with a species specific site [21], indicating that retention of
PPARg binding is increased near upregulated genes.
While previous reports agree that retention of transcription factor binding sites is limited, systematic analysis of the biological features determining whether a site is
retained or not has not been performed. In particular, the
interdependence between retention of the transcription
factor binding sites of two transcription factors has not
been investigated. Here, we used ChIP-seq to generate
genome-wide binding profiles of C/EBPa and PPARg in
human SGBS adipocytes, compared these to previously
published profiles in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes [15,16],
and systematically studied what features affect whether a
binding site is retained between species or not.
We find that PPARg binding sites have higher retention near genes upregulated during adipogenesis, and
that regions bound by both factors are even more likely
to be retained. Interestingly, PPARg binding site retention in these co-bound regions is increased by the presence of a C/EBPa consensus site, suggesting that
C/EBPa may facilitate PPARg binding to DNA. At the
same time, and independent of C/EBPa and PPARg
sequence patterns, sequence conservation in the larger
region surrounding the actual binding sites has a positive impact on retention of both C/EBPa and PPARg
binding sites, indicating that other DNA sequence patterns also affect binding of these two factors to DNA.

Results
Genome-wide mapping of C/EBPa and PPARg binding in
human SGBS adipocytes

To compare C/EBPa and PPARg binding in mouse and
human adipocytes, we used ChIP-seq to generate

Schmidt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/152

genome-wide profiles of C/EBPa and PPARg binding in
human SGBS adipocytes. Mapped ChIP tags were analyzed using peak finder methods, which identify regions
enriched for ChIP tags. For simplicity, we will refer to
such regions as “sites”, but it is important to notice that
these regions are typically 100-400 nt wide (up to 1000
nt wide in ChIP-chip studies) and thus several magnitudes larger than the actual binding site (typically 520 nt). We used the MACS peak finder [29] to identify
regions consistently bound by C/EBPa and PPARg in
two biologically independent experiments. We detected
52,733 C/EBPa and 23,328 PPARg binding sites in
human SGBS adipocytes, and in accordance with previous findings in mouse [16], we found that 49.5% of
PPARg binding sites are also bound by C/EBPa. The
number of PPARg sites is comparable to the 39,968 sites
recently reported by Rosen and colleagues for in vitro
differentiated hASCs [21]. However, the numbers are
notably higher than the corresponding numbers in 3T3L1 cells, where 16,760 [16] and 15,461 (this study)
C/EBPa sites and 5299 [16] and 6952 [15] PPARg sites
were reported. It remains to be investigated whether
this represents a true species-specific difference, or
whether this is more related to technical issues such as
antibody specificity or cell culture conditions.
We have previously reported that binding profiles of
PPARg in 3T3-L1 s vary significantly between individual
experiments and laboratories [19]. Similarly, when comparing the PPARg sites of our own ChIP-seq study [15], the
ChIP-seq study of Rosen and colleagues [21], and the
ChIP-Chip study by Lazar and colleagues [16] only
approximately 50% of the detected peaks were shared
between 2 experiments, and only 2025 of a total of 12,136
peaks (16,6%) were shared between all 3 experiments
(Additional file 1 Fig. S1). To infer high confidence binding
sites occupied by C/EBPa and PPARg in mouse adipocytes,
we used only the 8688 C/EBPa and 3481 PPARg binding
sites from our ChIP-seq analysis that overlap with the previously published ChIP-chip sites [16]. The inferred high
confidence C/EBPa and PPARg binding sites have a smaller overlap of 36% (Figure 1A), compared with the previously reported >60% [16]. Possible explanations may be
the higher resolution of the ChIP-seq data as well as the
fact that the number of high confidence sites used is lower.
Correlating binding sites with gene expression patterns
during adipogenesis

We previously identified 1650 genes which were differentially expressed during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis as assessed
by RNAPII association to the respective genes [15]. In
that study, these genes were clustered in 5 different
expression clusters depending on their relative expression
profile during differentiation. For the purpose of this
study we combined the two clusters containing genes

downregulated during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. This
resulted in four new clusters: downregulated (1), transiently upregulated (2), moderately upregulated (3), and
highly upregulated (4) (Figure 1B). For each gene belonging to a particular cluster, we divided the genomic region
at +/- 100 kb around TSS into 10 kb intervals (“bins”)
and counted the number of mouse PPARg binding sites
within each such intervals. The PPARg binding sites are
enriched in the vicinity of all regulated genes compared
to randomly selected regions (Figure 1C). Moreover and
consistent with previous findings [15,16], PPARg binding
sites in mouse adipocytes are highly enriched in the vicinity of genes moderately (3) and highly (4) upregulated
during adipogenesis (Figure 1C). Similarly, PPARg binding sites are also enriched in the vicinity of the human
gene orthologs of the genes in these clusters (Figure 1C),
consistent with a role for PPARg in the regulation of
these genes in SGBS adipocytes.
Measuring retention of mouse binding sites in human

To study the retention of C/EBPa and PPARg binding
sites between mouse and human adipocytes, we used
human-mouse genome alignments [30] to identify
human genome regions orthologous to C/EBPa and
PPARg sites in mouse (see Methods). To make sure that
the sites were orthologous at genome sequence level,
a mouse site had to map to a single location in the
human genome, which in turn had to map back to the
original site in mouse. We did not address site loss or
gain due to large deletions or insertions in one species.
This resulted in 2176 PPARg and 4899 C/EBPa mouse
sites that could be mapped to the human genome
(62.5% and 56.3% of all detected mouse PPARg and
C/EBPa binding sites, respectively).
We defined a mouse binding site as retained when its
corresponding human coordinates overlapped a human
binding site (Figure 2). A potential problem with this
approach is that it will be dependent on the thresholds
used in peak finding, and it also models average transcription factor binding in a cell population as on-off
events, which is a large simplification. Since the relative
number of ChIP’ed sequence tags in a region will indicate the average “strength” of the binding, i.e. average
occupancy time, we also measured retention in a complementary way. Thus, in a human genomic region corresponding to a mouse binding site, we counted the
number of ChIP’ed tags from the transcription factor in
question and calculated a log(fold-change) enrichment
relative to the genomic background in human (see
Methods) (Figure 2). The advantage of this approach
compared to the above method is that the retention of
sites will not be on-off (binary) events but a continuous
measure, and weaker cases of retention may be discovered. We will refer to these two methods to measure

Figure 2 Two methods for measuring retention of binding sites. We use three examples to illustrate our two complementary methods and
their detection of retention or loss of mouse sites. Both methods start out from mouse binding sites, detected as peaks from the mouse ChIPseq data [15]. Red lines show the midpoints of mouse sites and the corresponding positions in the human genome. Similarly, the yellow area
corresponds to the ends of the mouse site and the corresponding orthologous sequences in human. (A) Retention of a mouse site. The mouse
binding region overlaps with a human binding region (peak detected from human data) in the corresponding human orthologous region. Using
the binary method, this defines a retained site. The enrichment method compares the ChIP density in the orthologous human region with
random regions to calculate fold enrichment. In this case the human ChIP signal is strong which results in a high fold enrichment. (B)
Intermediary retention. In this example, a fraction of the binding activity remains in the human orthologous region. This will not be detected
using peak finding, and the site will be classified as lost using the binary method. However, the enrichment method will give this region an
intermediary fold enrichment score, since there are more ChIP-seq tags than expected by random. (C) Loss of a mouse site. Here, there is no
detectable ChIP-seq signal in the orthologous human region. The binary method will classify this site as non-retained and thereby lost in human,
while the enrichment will report a fold enrichment near zero, since the enrichment is similar to that of random regions.

the amount of site retention as the binary and enrichment method, respectively.
Using the binary method, we find that most binding
sites are species specific; only 19.5% of C/EBPa and
16.9% of PPARg binding sites in mouse adipocytes are
retained in human adipocytes (Figure 3A). The enrichment analysis supports the binary analysis in that most
of the enrichment values for both factors are located
around 0, which is expected by random, and in that
many of the mouse sites map to human regions that are
totally devoid of ChIP-seq tags (negative fold change)
(Figure 3B).
Conversely, there are sites that we with high confidence can label as retained between species. We noticed
that there are larger genomic regions in which the
majority of C/EBPa and PPARg binding are retained as
exemplified by the PPARG2 locus (Figure 3C). Given the
crucial role of PPARg in adipocyte differentiation, it is
tempting to suggest that the reason that these particular
sites are retained is their importance for the overall regulatory regime, since they likely regulate a key transcription factor. Prompted by this observation, we proceeded

to systematically identify biological features that are
positively correlated with increased retention of PPARg
and C/EBPa sites, with the hope of increasing our
understanding of adipocyte gene regulation.
Retention of PPARg binding sites is increased in the
vicinity of genes up-regulated during 3T3-L1
adipogenesis

Several studies have reported that retention of binding
sites is generally higher in the vicinity of putative key target genes [20-25]. However, species-specific binding sites
are also enriched in these regions, and no studies have
addressed whether the relative retention of binding sites
(i.e the fraction of the sites in a mouse region that is
retained vs. lost in human) is increased in the vicinity of
putative target genes of the transcription factor. The
assignment of target genes for binding sites is not trivial.
Most studies agree that sites proximal to a gene are more
likely to regulate the gene in question but this is not an
absolute truth. In light of this, we used a combination of
distance and gene expression to associate genes and binding sites. Thus, to systematically investigate how binding

(blue), retained PPARg binding sites (red), and lost binding sites (gray), all from mouse to human using the binary method. (B) Retention using
the enrichment method. The plot shows the distribution of tag enrichment in the human regions orthologous to the mouse sites, calculated as
log2(fold change compared to random expectation). High values indicate high levels of enrichment and therefore retention. C/EBPa and PPARg
retention is indicated by blue and red color, respectively. The distributions are shown as a variant of boxplots called “violin plots”, a rotated
density plot. The width of the colored area corresponds to how many data points that fall into that range [48]. The black dot within each plot
represents the median and hinges the 75th, and 25th quartiles of the respective distribution, similar to a box plot. In both cases most of the
probability density is located around a log fold change of 0, indicating that most regions are not retained. (C) Example of retention of multiple
mouse/human sites in the PPARG2 locus. The ChIP-seq density is shown for PPARg (red) and C/EBPa (blue) in both species, together with the
UCSC gene models. The PPARG2 locus with TSS and exons is indicated as a black line and filled bars, respectively. Grey lines show center in
mouse sites and corresponding regions in human. Green and pink arrow structures represent alignment blocks from the UCSC browser.

site retention is affected by the vicinity to putative target
genes, we labeled sites in the following way. First, for
each binding site, we located the closest gene TSS. If this
TSS was closer than 100 kb, and the gene was within one
of the pre-defined expression clusters shown in Figure 1
(a differentially expressed gene), the site was labeled with
the corresponding cluster number (cluster 1 to 4). Sites
where the closest TSS was closer than 100 kb but the
gene was not part of any expression cluster (a gene with
no measurable difference in expression during adipogenesis) were defined to belong to a new cluster, cluster 5
(“constitutive genes”). Finally, all sites with no gene TSS
within 100 kb were defined to belong to a new cluster:
cluster 6 (“distal sites”). There are obviously many ways
to assign binding sites to putative target genes. However,
the overall results described below are not specific to the
cluster assignment method used. For instance, assigning
sites to expression clusters only based on the identity of
the closest gene gave very similar results (data not
shown).

We then measured the fraction of mouse C/EBPa and
PPARg binding sites that was retained and lost in
human. The fraction of retained PPARg binding sites is
significantly higher in the vicinity of genes that are
moderately or highly upregulated (clusters 3 and 4)
compared to all other binding sites (Fischer Exact Test,
P < 2.2*10^-16). Conversely, retention of C/EBPa sites
appears to be slightly increased in the vicinity of highly
upregulated genes (cluster 4) compared to all other
binding sites, but the difference is not statistically significant (Fischer Exact Test, P = 0.1) (Figure 4A). This is
also true if assessing retention by the enrichment
method (Wilcoxon test; C/EBPa, cluster 4 vs. all other
clusters, P = 0.056; PPARg cluster 4 vs. all other clusters, P = 2.9*10^-5; PPARg cluster 3 vs. clusters 1+2+5
+6, P = 4.55*10^-5) (Figure 4B). Further analysis of the
enrichment values showed that also mouse C/EBPa and
PPARg binding sites associated with moderately and
highly upregulated genes (cluster 3 and 4) have on average more ChIP tags (i.e. display stronger binding) than

Figure 4 Binding site retention is correlated with binding strength and vicinity to adipogenic genes. C/EBPa and PPARg binding sites
were assigned to the closest TSS of a cluster gene within 100 kb. Cluster 5 contains binding sites assigned to genes with no significant
expression change, and cluster 6 contains binding sites >100 kb from the closest gene. (A) Bar diagrams representing the fraction of retained C/

Correlation between retention of mouse sites in human and binding strength in mouse measured by the number of ChIP-seq tags. Mouse
binding sites were divided into four groups from low to high ChIP-seq density (x-axis), and we investigated what fraction of these sites were
retained in human (y axis). Numbers above the bars correspond to the total number of retained mouse sites in human.

other sites (Wilcoxon test; C/EBPa, P = 1.643*10^-14;
PPARg, P=5.315*10^-6) (Figure 4C). Thus, target sites
in the vicinity of cluster 4 genes are on average bound
more strongly by C/EBPa and PPARg than sites in the
vicinity of other genes (Figure 4B and 4C). This raised
the question whether the binding strength in mouse, as
measured by the number of ChIP tags, is indicative of
binding site retention in human. Therefore, we divided
mouse binding sites into quartiles according to binding
strength and analyzed retention of C/EBPa and PPARg
binding in these subgroups (Figure 4D). Indeed, mouse
sites that are strongly bound by either factor are more
likely to be retained in human.

Turnover of PPARg binding is increased in the vicinity of
genes upregulated during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis

As discussed above, most mouse sites are not retained
in human. However, gene regulation may be retained, if
a lost site is replaced by another species-specific site in
human nearby the “original” mouse site [31]. We will
refer to this scenario as site turnover. Here we defined
turnover as a case where a mouse binding site is lost at
the corresponding region in human, but compensated
by a human-specific site within 10 kb of the location of
the lost site in human. Employing these criteria, we analyzed turnover of C/EBPa and PPARg binding sites
assigned to the different gene expression clusters.

PPARg and C/EBPa sites, ii) a single PPARg site or iii) a
single C/EBPa site (Figure 6A-B). We will refer to these
cases as ‘overlapping sites’ and PPARg- or C/EBPa-only
sites, respectively. The sites in the overlapping group are
retained to a higher degree than the other two categories using the binary method (Fisher Exact
Test; PPARg, P = 6.2*10^-4; C/EBPa, P = 3.5*10^-3)
(Figure 6B); and this is also true if the enrichment
method is used (Wilcoxon test; PPARg, P = 3.9*10^-4;
C/EBPa, P = 0.007) (Figure 6C). Interestingly, the overlapping sites are primarily retained as overlapping sites
in human, whereas PPARg-only and C/EBPa-only sites
are primarily retained as such (Figure 6A-B). However, a
few percent of PPARg and C/EBPa-only sites in mouse
are detected as overlapping sites in human. We cannot
exclude that some of these could be the result of threshold issues in the mouse dataset.
Since we now established that both the expression
pattern of nearby genes and co-binding of PPARg and
C/EBPa have an impact on retention of sites, we

Interestingly, the turnover of PPARg binding sites is
highly increased for sites close to moderately or highly
upregulated genes (clusters 3 and 4) (Wilcoxon test,
P=8.183*10^-4) (Figure 5A). In particular, >60% of
PPARg binding sites in the vicinity of highly upregulated
genes in mouse adipocytes are either retained or
undergo turnover in human adipocytes. Moreover, the
highly upregulated genes are much more likely
than genes in other clusters to gain multiple human
specific PPARg binding sites in human adipocytes
(Figure 5B). By contrast, human-specific C/EBPa sites
are found more evenly distributed in the different clusters (Figure 5A+B).
Retention of C/EBPa and PPARg binding is increased at
regions bound by both C/EBPa and PPARg

As discussed above, a large fraction of PPARg binding
sites (36%) are also bound by C/EBPa. To assess the
importance of this overlap, we compared the retention
of mouse sites that consist of either: i) overlapping

proceeded to see how these two associations are
depending on one another. About 20% of C/EBPa-only
sites are retained in human, regardless of expression
pattern of nearby genes (Figure 6D), but C/EBPa binding sites overlapping PPARg sites have a significantly
higher retention if they are in the vicinity of moderately
or highly upregulated genes (cluster 3 and 4) (Fisher
Exact Test, P = 8.6*10^-15). Thus, the increased retention of C/EBPa binding in the vicinity of highly

upregulated genes (Figure 4A), originates from increased
retention of the binding sites that overlap with PPARg
binding.
For PPARg-only sites there are large differences in the
amount of retention depending on which gene expression cluster the sites are assigned to, with sites close to
highly upregulated genes most likely to be retained
(Fisher Exact Test, P = 0.01). By contrast, retention of
PPARg sites overlapping with C/EBPa is less affected by

Schmidt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/152

proximity to highly upregulated genes (Fisher Exact
Test, P = 0.2, PPARg overlap cluster 4 vs. all other cluster) (Figure 6C). Interestingly, retention of PPARg sites
near highly upregulated genes is not affected by overlap
with C/EBPa (Fisher Exact Test, P = 0.8179, PPARg
overlap cluster 4 vs. PPARg only cluster 4). Overall
these findings are supported by the enrichment analysis
(Figure 6E), although in this case, the enrichment of
C/EBPa sites that overlap with PPARg sites near moderately and highly upregulated genes is only close to significant (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.05707, clusters 3+4 vs. all
other clusters), and the enrichment of PPARg sites that
overlap with C/EBPa sites near highly upregulated
genes is now significantly higher than for other PPARg
sites overlapping C/EBPa (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.001).
C/EBPa sequence patterns are indicative of PPARg
retention in human but not vice versa

To further investigate the interdependence of retention
of C/EBPa and PPARg binding at overlapping sites, we
wanted to assess whether the presence of predicted
binding sites (consensus sites) for the respective factors
in human were indicative of retention of mouse binding sites in human. We scanned each of the human
regions orthologous to mouse PPARg and C/EBPa
binding sites with position weight matrices (PWM)
(reviewed in [32,33]) describing the DNA binding preference of C/EBPa and PPARg. We used thresholds
defined by simulation studies (see Methods), and noted
whether each binding site had one or more consensus
sites for the respective factor. For this analysis, it is
important to consider that the consensus site for
C/EBPa is similar to that of most other members of
the C/EBP family. As expected, PPARg-binding sites in
mouse are more likely to be retained in human if the
corresponding human region has a PPARg consensus
site, and mouse C/EBPa binding sites are also more
likely to be retained if their corresponding human
regions have a C/EBP consensus sites (Fisher Exact
Test; C/EBPa only, P = 8.125*10^-08; C/EBPa overlap,
P = 3.344*10^-07; PPARg only, P = 5.533*10^-06;
PPARg overlap, P = 1.935*10^-06) (Figure 7A).
Interestingly, we found that PPARg binding sites overlapping C/EBPa sites in mouse are more likely to be
retained as PPARg binding sites in human if they have a
C/EBP consensus site (Fisher Exact Test, P = 0.009)
(Figure 7B). We noticed the same tendency for PPARg
binding sites not overlapping C/EBPa sites in mouse,
although this trend is not strong enough to be statistically significant (Fisher Exact Test, P = 0.16). However,
the opposite is not true, i.e. PPARg consensus sites have
no impact on the retention of mouse C/EBPa binding
sites in human (Fisher Exact, P = 0.88) (Figure 6B).

Page 10 of 16

One way to interpret this is that for regions bound by
both factors, the C/EBP consensus site is being selected
for over evolution rather than the PPARg consensus site,
which would indicate that PPARg binding is dependent
on sequence-specific C/EBP binding. There are several
mechanisms that could explain this, including PPARg
binding to suboptimal sites with the help of C/EBPa,
indirect binding by tethering to C/EBPa, and indirect
binding via long range chromosomal loops [34,35].
It is likely that in addition to C/EBPa, several other
transcription factors cooperate with PPARg in the transactivation of nearby genes, and some of these factors
may also cooperate with PPARg in DNA binding. Such
cooperativity would be expected to contribute to the
retention of PPARg sites. We investigated how the evolutionary constraint on the overall DNA sequence
within the binding region of each mouse PPARg and
C/EBPa binding site affects retention of these binding
sites in human. We found that regions with high
mouse-human DNA sequence identity have higher
retention of both C/EBPa and PPARg binding (Figure
7C). Interestingly, the “high identity quartile” is not
enriched for regions containing C/EBPa and PPARg
consensus sites (Figure 7D and 7E), indicating that
other sequence patterns/transcription factors are also
important for retention of C/EBPa and PPARg binding.

Discussion
In this study, we used ChIP-seq to generate genomewide profiles of the binding sites of the major adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPa and PPARg, in
mature human SGBS adipocytes. We identified 52,733
C/EBPa and 23,328 PPARg binding sites, and consistent
with previous studies in mouse adipocytes [15,16] we
found that PPARg binding sites are highly enriched in
the vicinity of genes upregulated during adipogenesis.
Furthermore, and also consistent with what has been
reported for mouse adipocytes [16], a high percentage
(49.5%) of the PPARg binding sites overlap with C/EBPa
binding sites. Thus, these data indicate conservation of
the overall regulatory regime of C/EBPa and PPARg
between mouse and human adipocytes, including their
potential direct cooperativity through binding to adjacent sites. However, despite the conservation of the
overall regulatory regime and putative target genes
between mouse and human adipocytes the retention of
mouse binding sites in human is limited, i.e. most sites
are species-specific. Similar results demonstrating limited retention of binding sites despite extensive conservation of association with putative functional targets
have previously been reported for other transcription
factors [20,22-25], and was recently also reported by
Rosen and colleagues when comparing PPARg binding

sites in primary human in vitro differentiated adipocytes
with the binding sites identified in murine 3T3-L1
cells [21].
Despite the fact that most binding sites of PPARg and
C/EBPa are species-specific, there are some sites that we
can confidently classify as retained between human and
mouse. There are also larger genomic regions, like the
PPARG2 locus, where most sites are retained (Figure 3C).
This observation prompted us to systematically investigate what biological features determine whether a site is

retained or not. Thus, we have systematically investigated
several biological features that could affect the retention
of mouse C/EBPa and PPARg binding sites, using two
complementary methods with different advantages, i.e. a
binary approach where overlaps of sites are counted, and
an enrichment approach where the signal strength of
human ChIP reads is assessed. The binary approach has
the advantage of being conservative (i.e. only strong signals are being labeled as bound sites), and it is easier to
interpret the outcomes as sites can be either lost or

Schmidt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/152

retained. Conversely, the enrichment method can take
weaker sites into account and is not dependent on specific thresholds in peak finding; however, this method will
not clearly define what sites are retained and lost, as it
imposes no thresholds on the data.
Regardless of method, we find that there is a significantly increased retention as well as turn-over of PPARg
binding sites in the vicinity of genes upregulated during
adipogenesis compared with binding sites more distant
from such genes. By contrast, retention of C/EBPa binding is only slightly increased in the vicinity of genes that
are highly upregulated. The difference indicates that
there is a higher evolutionary pressure to maintain specific PPARg binding sites compared with specific
C/EBPa binding sites for the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and function. This may reflect the higher
importance of PPARg over C/EBPa in adipocyte differentiation, as most clearly demonstrated by Spiegelmann
and colleagues, who showed that that ectopic expression
of PPARg in C/EBPa -/- mouse embryo fibroblasts
(MEF) [36], but not C/EBPa in PPARg -/- MEFs [14],
can induce adipogenesis. In addition, since there are
more C/EBPa binding sites than PPARg binding sites
there may be less evolutionary constraint on the individual C/EBPa sites. This could reflect the lower binding
specificity of C/EBPa, since it is easier to create a new
site if the factor can bind to many different sequences.
We also observed that mouse sites that are strongly
bound by either factor are more likely to be retained,
but the causality is unclear. Stronger binding sites could
be under higher selective pressure, since they are more
likely to have a vital function. In addition, stronger binding sites could be harder to erode over time, as these are
likely to represent sites where multiple factors such as
co-binding transcription factors and chromatin accessibility contribute to a high occupancy of the site. Thus,
strongly bound sites in a common ancestor between two
species might require more evolutionary changes to be
reduced to a fully inactive site in one species.
The remarkable overlap between PPARg and C/EBPa
binding reported previously [15,16] indicates cooperativity between the two transcription factors. In support of
this, we find that retention of both C/EBPa and PPARg
binding is increased, when the binding sites overlap
with a binding site of the other factor, suggesting that a
potential synergy between these two factors is of such
significance that selective pressure on these overlapping
sites is increased. Interestingly, while retention of
C/EBPa-only sites is not affected by vicinity to regulated
genes, the C/EBPa sites that overlap with PPARg sites
display increased retention in the vicinity of upregulated
genes, further indicating an importance of C/EBPa cobinding with PPARg in adipocyte gene regulation.

Page 12 of 16

We also analyzed the sequence of human genomic
regions corresponding to overlapping PPARg and C/EBPa
binding sites in mouse adipocytes. These analyses revealed
that presence of the C/EBP consensus sequence in the
human sequence not only predicts the retention of
C/EBPa binding but, surprisingly, also retention of PPARg
binding at sites that overlap with C/EBPa binding sites in
mouse. By contrast, the PPAR consensus sequence in the
human sequence only predicts retention of PPARg binding, not retention of C/EBPa binding at sites overlapping
with PPARg binding sites. This indicates that at these
overlapping sites, the C/EBP consensus sequence in the
binding region is being selected for over evolution to a
higher degree than the PPAR consensus site, suggesting
that PPARg binding is directed by C/EBPa binding. By
analogy, differential binding of nuclear factor B (NFB)
in 10 human individuals correlates with changes in a consensus sites of a reported cooperating transcription factor,
signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat 1)
[37], and similar results have been found in studies in
yeast [38] and fungi [39].
Possible mechanisms explaining the interdependence
between observed C/EBP consensus site conservation
and PPARg retention include C/EBP-assisted binding of
PPARg to an adjacent consensus site as well as indirect
binding of PPARg to DNA by tethering to C/EBPa or by
long range intrachromosomal loops [34,35]. Lazar and
colleagues have previously investigated the interdependence of C/EBPa and PPARg binding in mature 3T3-L1
adipocytes and failed to see an effect of C/EBPa knockdown on PPARg binding to selected target sites in mature
3T3-L1 adipocytes [16]. However, since only a few sites
were investigated it is difficult to conclude on the general
importance. Furthermore, it is possible that other members of the C/EBP family, which all share the same consensus sequence, play a role in the establishment of the
PPARg transcriptional complex during adipogenesis and
a more limited role once the complex is established.
Intriguingly, recent data from our laboratory indicate
that C/EBPb, which is expressed early in differentiation,
may play a role in early chromatin remodeling of PPARg
binding sites (Siersbæk, Nielsen, John, Sung, Baek, Loft,
Hager, and Mandrup, EMBO Journal, in press)).
Odom and colleagues have previously shown that the
transcription factor binding regions that were retained
between multiple species had higher sequence constraint
than species specific binding regions [24], however the
interdependence between conservation of the region
around the bound site and the retention of the consensus site was not addressed. Interestingly, we show here
that the high identity quartile of binding sites (i.e. the
binding regions with the highest sequence conservation)
displayed increased retention of C/EBPa and PPARg

Schmidt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/152

binding independent of conservation of their respective
consensus sites. This strongly indicates that additional
sequence patterns are important for C/EBPa and PPARg
binding. Such sequence patterns could among others be
directing binding of cooperating transcription factors.

Conclusions
Here we have performed a comprehensive and systematic analysis to investigate what parameters affect the
retention of transcription factors binding between the
mouse and human genome. We show that retention of
PPARg and C/EBPa binding between mouse and
human adipocytes is interdependent, which strongly
indicates that these transcription factors cooperate at
the level of gaining access to their target sites in the
genome. In addition, our data show that overall
sequence conservation of the binding region contributes
to retention, suggesting that other sequence patterns
contribute to retention. Future experimental analyses
will be required to dissect the interdependence of
PPARg and C/EBPa and possibly other transcription
factors at a molecular level.

were: PPARg (H-100, sc7196, Santa Cruz), C/EBPa
(14AA, sc61). ChIP-seq sample preparation for sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina). Sequence reads from each ChIPseq library were mapped to the reference genomes mm9
for mouse and hg18 for human using the the BWA
alignment software allowing for 2 mismatches [43].
PPARg and C/EBPa binding sites were identified using
MACS [29] with a p-value cutoff of e-10, and using sonicated input as a control. C/EBPa and PPARg ChIP-seqs
in 3T3-L1 were performed in monoplicates, and to identify high confidence binding sites we compared our data
with previously published C/EBPa and PPARg ChIPchip data [16]. ChIP-seq binding regions overlapped by
ChIP-chip binding regions were used for downstream
analysis. C/EBPa and PPARg ChIP-seqs in SGBS cells
were performed in duplicates from two independent
experiments, and binding sites identified in both experiments were used for downstream analysis. Some of the
detected sites both in SGBS and 3T3-L1 cells were
much wider than expected, possibly due to multiple
nearby binding events or noise. To avoid these and
focus on reliable sites, we filtered away the 5% widest
binding sites.

Cell culture

The 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated to adipocytes
by stimulation with dexamethasone (DEX), 1-methyl-3isobutylxanthine (MIX) and insulin as described
previously [40]. The cells were harvested for ChIP
experiments at day 6 of differentiation. SGBS cells were
generously provided by Dr. Martin Wabitsch at the University of Ulm, Germany and differentiated to adipocytes
using a procedure modified from previous publications
[7,41]. Briefly, SGBS cells were grown to confluence in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/Nutrient Mixture
F-12 Ham’s supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
33 μM biotin, 17 μM pantothenate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 62.5 μg/ml penicillin, 1 ng/μl fibroblast growth
factors (FGF) 1, and 90 μg/μl heparin. At two days postconfluency, SGBS cells were stimulated to differentiate
with serum-free growth medium supplemented with
10 nM insulin, 200 pM triiodothyronine, 1 μM cortisol,
2 μM BRL 49653, 0.115 mg/ml MIX, 0.25 mmol/L DEX,
and 0.01 mg/ml human transferrin. After 3 days, the
medium was replaced with the differentiation medium
without FGF1 and heparin, and after 6 days Rosiglitazone/BRL49653, MIX, and DEX was removed from the
medium. The cells were harvested for ChIP experiments
at day 10 of differentiation.
ChIP-seq

ChIP experiments were performed according to standard protocol as described in [42]. Antibodies used

Finding regions bound by both PPARg and C/EBPa

Initial analysis of the overlap between C/EBPa and
PPARg binding sites in mouse showed that in the large
majority of cases either most of the site of one factor is
overlapped by the site of the other factor or it is not
overlapped at all (Additional file 1 Fig. S2). Thus, altering the threshold for how large the overlap should be
for sites to be considered overlapping, does not have
substantial impact of the downstream analysis. Based on
the percentage overlap shown in Additional file 1
Fig. S2 and the length distributions for the binding sites
in mouse, a C/EBPa site overlapping a PPARg site with
at least 1% of the total width of the C/EBPa site was
defined as “overlapping”. The PPARg binding sites are in
general more narrow than C/EBPa, so we used a higher
threshold of 10% overlap for PPARg. In human regions
corresponding to mouse sites we relaxed this criterion
to 1 nt overlap, since there is an implicit criterion for
both sites to be in the same region in the orthology analysis described below. Changing the criteria lead to no
substantial difference in terms of overall results (data
not shown).
Finding human genomic regions orthologous to the
mouse binding sites

We used the UCSC lift over tool [44,45] together with
chained BlastZ alignments [30] to lift over the binding
sites from mm9 to hg18 genome assemblies. We used

Schmidt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/152

minMatch = 0.1, which is the recommended setting for
inter-species comparisons. We then lifted the binding
sites back again and tested if they overlapped a minimum of 90% of the original region. Only binding sites
that could be uniquely mapped both ways were considered for the rest of the analyses.
Defining retained, species-specific binding sites and
turnover events

For each lifted mouse binding site we checked if >10%
of the site was overlapped by a human site, or vice
versa. If any of these criteria were true, the mouse site
was considered retained. Mouse binding sites that were
not retained was considered specific to mouse and lost
in human. In the same way, human binding sites that
are not overlapped 10% by a lifted mouse binding site
or vice versa were considered specific to human.
A lost binding site may have been replaced with a
new, species-specific binding site - i.e. binding site
turnover. For the binding sites lost in human, we
checked if a human-specific binding site is located
+/-10 kb (max 10 kb between the midpoints of the
two binding sites) from the original lifted binding site.
If this was the case, the site was considered subject to
a turnover event.
Calculating ChIP-seq enrichment in human

As a complementary approach to the above, we considered ChIP-seq counts in human regions orthologous to
mouse binding sites as a continuous variable rather than
counting the overlap of human ChIP-seq peaks defined
by the peak finder. This makes sense, as the number of
ChIP-seq tags should correspond to the binding strength
of a respective factor.
To make this comparable across regions, for a human
region defined as orthologous to a mouse binding site,
we counted the number of human ChIP tags in a window centered on the region with a window width corresponding to the 75 th percentile of all human binding
sites, for the respective factor: 520 nt for C/EBPa and
605 nt for PPARg. We then estimated the number of
ChIP-seq tags expected by random by calculating the
mean ChIP-seq counts of 2000 randomly sampled genomic regions with the same widths as above. A log2 fold
change value was calculated by dividing the observed
number of ChIP-seq tags in the orthologous region with
the random expectation. To avoid small number effects,
we added a pseudo-count of 1 to both random regions
and observed binding site counts.
Assigning genes and expression clusters to mouse
binding sites

For each binding site we identified all genes (knownGene table from UCSC genome browser database [46]),

Page 14 of 16

where the TSS is located +/-100 kb from the center of
the binding site. The binding site was labeled with the
label of the closest gene that was part of an expression
cluster. If none of the nearby genes were in a cluster,
the binding site was placed in cluster 5 (“constitutive
genes”); whereas the site was considered to belong to
cluster 6 (“distal sites”) if there were no TSS within
100 kb of the binding site.
Finding human gene orthologs to the differentially
expressed mouse genes

For each differentially expressed mouse gene we used
the UCSC lift over tool together with chained BlastZ
alignments to lift over the TSS +/-50 bp from mm9 to
hg18. We then found the closest gene (knownGene
table from UCSC) within 5 kb of the lifted TSS. Using
this method we found orthologous genes for 1482 of the
1626 mouse genes. We discarded from further analyses
the 113 TSS regions that could not be lifted, and the 49
of the lifted TSSs that were not located in proximity
(+/-5 kb) of any UCSC human gene.
Sequence content analysis

We scanned both strands of each human region defined
above with position weight matrices (PWMs) (reviewed
in [32]) from the JASPAR database (models MA0065.2
and MA0019.1, respectively, for PPARg and C/EBPa)
using the ASAP tool [47] based on a background model
following a uniform distribution. To decide a relevant
threshold for accepting a predicted binding site, we
repeated the analysis in randomly selected regions with
the respective PWM. A threshold of 80% of the scoring
range of each model could separate the ChIP’ed regions
and random regions best, so we used this for further
analysis.
Calculating human-mouse identity

According to the binding sites in mouse described
above, we extracted the alignments between mouse
and human by mafFrag from the Kent source utilities
http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu. We then applied Alistat, a
utility included in the HMMER package, http://hmmer.
janelia.org/ to calculate the identity score defined as
(#Identity/minimum (length1, length2)), where #identity is the number of exact identities in an alignment
and length1, length2 are the unaligned lengths of the
two sequences.
