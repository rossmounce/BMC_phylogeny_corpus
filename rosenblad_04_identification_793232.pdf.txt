SRP protozoa fungi RNA

Abstract
Background: The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for
targeting proteins to the ER membrane. The SRP of metazoans is well characterized and composed
of an RNA molecule and six polypeptides. The particle is organized into the S and Alu domains. The
Alu domain has a translational arrest function and consists of the SRP9 and SRP14 proteins bound
to the terminal regions of the SRP RNA. So far, our understanding of the SRP and its evolution in
lower eukaryotes such as protozoa and yeasts has been limited. However, genome sequences of
such organisms have recently become available, and we have now analyzed this information with
respect to genes encoding SRP components.
Results: A number of SRP RNA and SRP protein genes were identified by an analysis of genomes
of protozoa and fungi. The sequences and secondary structures of the Alu portion of the RNA
were found to be highly variable. Furthermore, proteins SRP9/14 appeared to be absent in certain
species. Comparative analysis of the SRP RNAs from different Saccharomyces species resulted in
models which contain features shared between all SRP RNAs, but also a new secondary structure
element in SRP RNA helix 5. Protein SRP21, previously thought to be present only in
Saccharomyces, was shown to be a constituent of additional fungal genomes. Furthermore, SRP21
was found to be related to metazoan and plant SRP9, suggesting that the two proteins are
functionally related.
Conclusions: Analysis of a number of not previously annotated SRP components show that the
SRP Alu domain is subject to a more rapid evolution than the other parts of the molecule. For
instance, the RNA portion is highly variable and the protein SRP9 seems to have evolved into the
SRP21 protein in fungi. In addition, we identified a secondary structure element in the
Sacccharomyces RNA that has been inserted close to the Alu region. Together, these results
provide important clues as to the structure, function and evolution of SRP.

Background
The mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP) plays a
critical role in targeting of proteins to the ER membrane.
SRP first binds the N-terminal signal sequence of the nascent chain as it appears on the surface of translating ribosomes. As a result, protein synthesis is arrested and the
ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex is targeted to the ER
membrane through interaction with the SRP receptor [1].
In a series of events that are accompanied by GTP hydrolysis, the SRP is released, protein synthesis is resumed and
translocation of the secretory protein is initiated.
The mammalian SRP is composed of six polypeptides
named SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP54, SRP68 and SRP72
which form a complex with a single RNA molecule (originally referred to as 7SL RNA) of approximately 300 nucleotide residues. The S domain (Fig. 1) of SRP is responsible
for signal sequence recognition and contains the central
region of SRP RNA and proteins SRP19, SRP54, SRP68
and SRP72. SRP54 is a highly conserved protein which is
responsible for signal sequence binding and it interacts
with the helix 8 region of the RNA. The Alu domain of the
SRP (Fig. 1) functions in translational arrest and is com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/5

posed of proteins SRP9/14 bound to the terminal regions
of SRP RNA [2,3]. High-resolution three-dimensional
structures of the Alu domain and critical parts of the S
domain were obtained recently [4-7] and provided considerable insight into structure and function of the mammalian SRP.
Components of the SRP have been identified in all three
domains of life [8]. The genomes of the Archaea were
shown to contain SRP RNAs which closely resemble the
sequences and secondary structures of the SRP RNAs of
metazoans, but only two SRP protein genes (SRP19 and
SRP54) could be identified [9]. The bacterial SRP consists
of protein SRP54 (referred to as Ffh) and a 4.5S RNA
which corresponds in large part to SRP RNA helix 8 of
mammalian SRP. Significantly larger bacterial SRP RNAs
(6S RNAs) which contain an Alu-like region are present in
a restricted number of taxa such as Bacillus [8]. A rationale
for the high level of conservation of SRP54 and SRP RNA
helix 8 in every SRP has been provided by the high-resolution structure of the E. coli SRP which suggested that the
signal peptide binds within a hydrophobic groove formed
by the M-domain of SRP54 as well as to SRP RNA [10].

Our understanding of the SRP components of the lower
eukaryotes has suffered from a lack of data required for
comparative sequence analysis. In addition, the greater
diversity of this phylogenetic group has made it difficult
to identify the SRP RNAs and SRP proteins even after the
genome sequences became available. For instance, despite
the detailed biochemical characterization of the yeast S.
cerevisiae SRP [11], an understanding of its structure has
been hampered by the fact that yeast SRP RNA is nearly
twice as long (519 nucleotide residues) with no obvious
homology to other known SRP RNA sequences [12].
Here we report an analysis of protozoan and fungal
genomes to identify several not previously annotated SRP
components. We have been able to identify several novel
SRP RNAs and compare their two-dimensional structures.
The analysis has lead us to propose that protein SRP21 of
S. cerevisiae is a homolog of SRP9 and thus might form a
heterodimer with SRP14 which binds to the Alu domain.
These studies provide not only inroads into the comprehensive molecular characterization of the SRP but also
clues as to the early evolution and origin of SRP and its
Alu domain.

Results and discussion
In aiming to produce a comprehensive inventory of SRP
components in protozoa and fungi we considered
Euglenozoans (Entosiphon, Trypanosoma, and Leishmania),
Alveolata
(Plasmodium,
Eimeria,
Theileria),
Chlamydomonas, Giardia, Entamoeba and Encephalitozoon.
Complete genome sequences and preliminary gene annotation were available for P. falciparum http://www.plas
modb.org, C. reinhardtii http://genome.jgi-psf.org/chlre1/
chlre1.home.html, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi [13]. Significant portions of the other genomes had been
sequenced as indicated in Table 1. For Entosiphon only a
very limited amount of sequence data was available. A
schematic phylogenetic tree involving the organisms discussed here is shown in Fig. 2. An overview of the results
of our inventory of SRP RNA and proteins in protozoa and
fungi is shown in Table 1. A significant number of these
were not previously annotated.
Identification and analysis of SRP RNA genes
To predict SRP RNA genes from protozoans and fungi we
used a method previously described [14]. The first step is
a heuristic pattern-based search for conserved features of
the helix 8 region as described under "Methods". The pattern was relatively degenerate and in many cases the result
included a number of false positives. In a second step the

on the tree shown in Baldauf et al [18]. Branch lengths are
not proportional to evolutionary distance.

candidates from the pattern-based search were screened
with a COVE model of SRP RNA. COVE is an implementation of the algorithms described by Eddy & Durbin [15]
that make use of probabilistic models to describe the
sequence and secondary structure consensus of an RNA
family. The COVE analysis is much more stringent than
the first pattern-based step and we expect very few false
positives among the high-scoring hits from this analysis.
The identified SRP RNA candidates aligned well to a
COVE model for eukaryotic RNAs in the conserved S
domain region, i.e. the part that corresponded to the helices 5, 6 and 8. The Alu domain displayed a higher degree
of variation and in many instances did not align well to
the COVE model. As a consequence, the prediction of the
5' and 3' ends of the molecule were in most cases
unreliable.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/5

The secondary structure of all candidates were also predicted with MFOLD [16] with default parameters or specifying constraints consistent with known conserved
elements of SRP RNA. MFOLD was able to fold the S
domain of the SRP RNA in a manner which was consistent
with the secondary structure predicted by COVE. However, when used without constraints, MFOLD typically
predicted a secondary structure for the Alu domain that
was inconsistent with our identifications. As a consequence, for the prediction of Alu domains as well as their
folding, we relied on consensus features, such as the presence of a conserved sequence motif UGUNR (where N is
any base and R is purine, typically an A) motif and the
general secondary structure outline (Fig. 1). In summary,
in our prediction and folding of SRP RNA we combined
pattern matching, COVE, and MFOLD, and we checked
that known consensus motifs of SRP RNAs were present in
the predicted RNAs. Finally, we used BLAST to show that
the predicted SRP RNA genes did not overlap with predicted protein-coding regions or any other annotated features. Therefore, we believe that the final candidates
presented here represent sequences that are evolutionary
related to SRP RNA. Still, it should be noted that we cannot distinguish between a bona fide SRP RNA gene and
pseudogenes that are known to occur in plants [8,17] and
in mammals. Examples are the two SRP RNA gene candidates that we identified in the C. reinhardtii genome. The
covariance models did not allow us to predict the 5' and
3' ends and the folding of the Alu domain of these two
sequences. Therefore, it remains to be seen which of these
candidates, if any, represents a functional RNA.
We were not able to identify an SRP RNA in Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica. However, as SRP proteins
were identified in these organisms we expect that, as the
genomes are completed, SRP RNA genes will be
discovered.
SRP RNAs of Euglenozoa and Alveolates display a large
variation in the Alu domain
An SRP RNA gene was identified in Entosiphon sulcatum
(Fig. 3). Its Alu domain was found to contain a very short
helix 4 and in this respect resembled the structure of the
Alu domain of the trypanosomatids. This relationship was
consistent with the known close evolutionary relationship
between euglenids and trypanosomatids [18]). Interestingly, the E. sulcatum SRP RNA gene was shown to be part
of a cluster which also contained genes for 5S rRNA, U1,
U2 and U5 snRNAs [19,20]). This gene organization is
reminiscent of that of T. brucei and Leishmania where SRP
RNA genes were found to be located adjacent to other
RNA genes [21,22].

In the group of the Alveolates we found an Eimeria tenella
SRP RNA (Fig. 3) with a predicted Alu domain structure

similar to that of the metazoans. Interestingly, the Alu
domain of Theileria annulata was reminiscent of the SRP
RNA Alu domain previously identified in the Ciliophora
Tetrahymena [23], in the respect that the helix 4 appeared
to be absent.
It has previously been reported that the genome of the
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum encodes several
SRP proteins [24]. Here, we were able to identify the corresponding SRP RNA (Fig. 3). The secondary structure of
the Alu domain of this RNA was predicted by combining
COVE and MFOLD procedures. In addition, the RNA of
two other Plasmodium species, P. yoelii and P. knowlesi,
were predicted to form the same structure despite significant differences in their primary sequences (Fig. 3). The
Alu domain of Plasmodium SRP RNA was different in that
it possessed an internal loop in helix 4. Therefore, even
within the Alveolates, a considerable variation in the predicted folding of the Alu domain was observed.
Saccharomyces SRP RNAs has an insert in helix 5 adjacent
to a highly conserved Alu hairpin motif
We previously identified SRP RNA genes in C. albicans and
N. crassa [14]. Here we also found an SRP RNA candidate
in Aspergillus nidulans. As shown for Yarrowia SRP RNA in
Fig. 4, in all of these fungi, including S. pombe, the SRP
RNA secondary structure were shown to be very similar.
For the unusually large (519 nts) SRP RNA of S. cerevisiae[12], the COVE model predicted an S domain with
helices 5, 6 and 8 as for other eukaryotic RNAs. MFOLD
also folded this part of the molecule in accordance with
the consensus 2D structure of the S domain. As the 5' and
3' terminal sequences were shown to be related to Alu, we
concluded that the S. cerevisiae SRP RNA contained at least
one insert as compared to other fungi. Secondary structures for the SRP RNAs including these inserts were constructed for S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. bayanus, S. castellii
and S. kluyveri. The sequences were identified by BLAST
using the S. cerevisiae sequence as query. For the prediction of the 5' end of the RNA we took advantage of the fact
that the highly conserved Alu domain was present at the
very 5' end of the RNA. For prediction of the 3' end we
considered a T-rich region which was conserved in all six
Saccharomyces strains and likely is part of a transcription
termination signal.

Since the number of available Saccharomyces SRP RNA
sequences was too low for using covariation or mutual
information analysis, and a COVE model that would predict the pairing in the insert regions could not be
obtained, MFOLD was used first with each full-length
sequence to predict the secondary structure. As expected,
all Saccharomyces sequences folded into structures which
contained helices 5, 6 and 8 as predicted for S. cerevisiae.
Furthermore, all Saccharomyces RNAs possessed a hairpin

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/5

structure with the Alu UGUNR motif at the 5' end similar
to what was observed in the Alu domains of the other
fungi. A multiple alignment was obtained using
procedures described under Methods and is available in
the web supplement to this paper http://bio.lund
berg.gu.se/srp03/.
As for the SRP RNA insertions specific to Saccharomyces,
MFOLD predicted the structure shown in Fig. 4 containing
the helices that we here refer to as 5c-g (Fig. 4). The helices
5h-i were also characteristic of the Saccharomyces RNAs.
Smaller corresponding inserts reminiscent of these were
found in Yarrowia, Neurospora and Aspergillus. The predicted secondary structure of the 5c-g region was very similar in all Saccharomyces species although there was
significant variation in sequence. The bases involved in
compensatory base changes in this part of the RNA (Fig.
4) offer support to the predicted folding.
The 5c-g insertion appeared to be specific to Saccharomyces
and indicated that at some point during evolution this
piece of the RNA was inserted near the 5' end as indicated
in Fig. 4. The evolution of Saccharomyces also involved the
enlargement of helices 5h and 5i. One may speculate that
these species have developed some additional mechanisms related to SRP-mediated translational arrest or
additional unknown functions.
Our findings suggested that all fungal SRP RNAs contain a
hairpin structure with a Alu UGUNR motif at the 5' end.
This part of the RNA was found to be conserved and there
was phylogenetic support for the hairpin structure from
the covariations indicated in Fig. 4. The fungal hairpin
motif was distinct from all other known non-fungal Alu
domains where the conserved UGUNR motif was found
to be part of a more elaborate pseudoknot.
It has been shown previously that a 5' terminal 99 nt fragment of the S. cerevisiae RNA was able to bind in vitro to
the SRP14 protein. A tentative model of this portion of the
SRP RNA has been presented where only the 5' terminal
portion formed the Alu domain [25]. However, based on
the analysis presented here it is likely that also the 3' portion is part of the Alu domain.
An SRP RNA candidate in E. cuniculi
There is strong evidence that the Microsporidia, such as E.
cuniculi, are phylogenetically related to Fungi [13]. An
analysis of the E. cuniculi genome revealed a candidate
SRP RNA in a 396 nt intergenic region (chromosome X,
positions 138833â139226) which contained helices 6
and 8, and aligned well with our eukaryotic COVE model.
However, we were unable to identify a typical metazoan
Alu domain. Fig. 3 shows a tentative model of the Alu
domain which is similar to that of other fungi.

Proposed secondary structures of Saccharomyces SRP RNAs
Figure 4
Proposed secondary structures of Saccharomyces SRP RNAs. Models of the RNAs of S. kluyveri, S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica are shown. Saccharomyces RNAs have regions, 5c-g and 5h-i (shaded) not found in other fungi. Inset with shaded background with helices 5c-g are showing compensatory base changes in this domain (bases with white background). Also indicated
is the location of the 5c-g insert as related to Yarrowia (arrow) as well as conserved sequence elements of the fungal Alu
domain (box). The complete models of other Saccharomyces species are shown in the web supplement at http://bio.lund
berg.gu.se/srp03/.

Identification of SRP proteins
We used a range of tools to identify and inventory SRP
proteins in protozoa and fungi. Genome sequences were
analyzed for genes encoding SRP proteins using BLAST
[26] or FASTA [27] using previously known eukaryotic
SRP proteins as query sequences. In addition, we performed PSI-BLAST [26] searches where a SRP protein
sequence, typically the human ortholog, was used to
search a database with the proteins in a public protein

sequence database combined with the proteins obtained
by translating all possible open reading frames of the
genome being analyzed. Genomes were also analyzed
using Genscan [28] or GlimmerM [29] and predicted peptide sequences were used in a BLAST or PSI-BLAST procedure as above. The results of our findings are shown in
Table 1. One should keep in mind that several genomes
were incomplete although large portions were covered by
raw sequence data or contigs. The fact that we failed to

Page 7 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2004, 5

identify a certain component of SRP was therefore not
entirely conclusive in these cases (indicated by empty cells
in Table 1).
As previously noted for other species, SRP54 was shown
to be ubiquitous and highly conserved. Also SRP19,
SRP68 and SRP72 were found in most of the genomes
analyzed here (Table 1) although we were unable to identify a SRP72 homolog among the Alveolates. In E. cuniculi
we failed to identify SRP68/72, as described further
below. We obtained evidence that the SRP9/14 proteins
were subject to a more rapid evolution, as discussed in the
following.
Absence of SRP9/14 in certain protozoa and Microsporidia
SRP9 and 14 homologs were identified in Plasmodium falciparum and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The SRP14
homolog in P. falciparum has been identified previously
but annotated as a hypothetical protein (http://www.plas
modb.org, accession PFL0160w). SRP14 was found also
in E. tenella and E. histolytica. However, we were unable to
identify SRP9/14 in Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi,
Theileria annulata, Giardia lamblia and E. cuniculi.
Although an intriguing observation, we could not formally rule out the possibility that SRP9/14 homologs
would be discovered during the completion of the
genome assemblies and that the SRP9/14 protein
sequences in these organisms have strongly diverged from
known members of this protein family.

Evidence has been provided that Leptomonas and T. brucei
possess a tRNA-like RNA that associates with the SRP
[30,31]. It has been speculated that this RNA compensates
for the loss of portions of the Alu domain [31]. The possibility that the tRNA-like RNA took the role of proteins
SRP9/14 was considered as well. Upon completion of
additional trypanosomatid genome sequences it will be
interesting to determine if SRP in all these organisms carry
a tRNA-like component and if they all lack SRP9/14.
The microsporidian E. cuniculi has a highly compact
genome that seem to have been under a pressure to eliminate non-essential material. As SRP9/14, 68 and 72 seem
to be missing, the evolution of this organism could have
involved the loss of these genes. The lack of these proteins
would suggest that they are less critical for SRP function.
It is interesting to note that in this respect E. cuniculi
resembles archaea which also appear to lack SRP9/14, 68
and 72.
Yeast SRP21 is related to metazoan and plant SRP9
Homologs of SRP14, SRP19, SRP54, SRP68, and SRP72
were identified in all the Saccharomyces species (Table 1).
It has been reported previously that S. cerevisiae possess
SRP21 which was thought to be a new family of SRP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/5

proteins [11] unique to Saccharomyces. We have here reexamined the relationship of SRP21 to other proteins,
including those of the SRP. Homologs to S. cerevisiae
SRP21 in S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. bayanus, S. castellii,
S. kluyveri and S. paradoxus sequences were initially identified using BLAST. The E-values ranged from 1e-77 (S.
paradoxus) to 1e-29 (S. kluyveri). A homolog to SRP21 was
found also in Candida albicans (E-value 8e-06). Open
reading frames in the region of the BLAST hit were
identified to obtain a likely full-length protein sequence
for the C. albicans SRP21 (Fig. 5). We also identified the S.
pombe protein YE07_SCHPO (T37873) as a distantly
related homolog, with a E-value of 6.3. Interestingly, this
protein displayed a distant homology to metazoan protein SRP9 and was previously listed in the SRPDB as a
potential SRP9 homolog. Using the S. pombe protein as
query we identified a possible homolog in Neurospora
crassa (E-value 5e-6) using TBLASTN to search N. crassa
genomic sequences (Fig. 5).
We considered that SRP21 might bind to the regions
inserted specifically into Saccharomyces SRP RNA, i.e helices 5c-g or 5h-i. However, this possibility appeared
unlikely because SRP21 homologs were identified also in
those fungi that did not possess these helix 5 expansions.
To further examine the SRP21 homologs and their relationship with SRP9 we carried out profile-based searches.
First, all novel putative yeast SRP21 homologs identified
here were merged with the sequences of public protein
sequence databases (Genpept and SWISSPROT/TREMBL).
The resulting databases were used in profile-based
searches including PSI-BLAST, PROFILESEARCH, and
hmmsearch. For instance, when the S. cerevisiae SRP21
sequence was used as query in a PSI-BLAST search, after
two iterations the S. pombe protein YE07_SCHPO
(T37873) was identified above the default threshold (Evalue 0.01) together with the Candida and Saccharomyces
SRP21 proteins (not shown). Second, PROFILESEARCH
was used with a profile based on a multiple alignment of
the Saccharomyces sequences (Fig. 6, sequences shown in
lighter gray) obtained by CLUSTALW to search SWISSPROT/TREMBL (approximately 1 million protein
sequences as of March 2003). In the result of this search
the Candida, Neurospora, and S. pombe sequences followed
immediately after the Saccharomyces SRP21 sequences
(Fig. 6). Interestingly, the SRP9 proteins of maize, Arabidopsis, and C. elegans ranked closely to the top-scoring
yeast sequences, although they had scores lower than the
other SRP21-related proteins. Similar results were
obtained with hmmsearch (not shown).
A multiple alignment of SRP21 and SRP9 as well as SRP14
protein sequences is shown in Fig. 5. The alignment of
SRP9 to SRP14 is the structural alignment of Birse et al.

Alignment ofSRP14 proteinsSRP21 proteins with C. albicans, N. crassa and S. pombe homologs, metazoan and plant SRP9 proFigure well Saccharomyces
teins as 5
Alignment of Saccharomyces SRP21 proteins with C. albicans, N. crassa and S. pombe homologs, metazoan and
plant SRP9 proteins as well SRP14 proteins. The alignment of SRP9 to SRP14 is that previously shown in Birse et al [32].
The alignment of SRP9 to SRP21 is based on the results of profile-based searches like the one shown in Fig. 6 and CLUSTALW.
The secondary structure from Birse et al. is shown with gray cylinders for Î±-helices and arrows for Î²-strands. The region
between Î²-1 and Î²-2 (box) is not aligned. Boxed residues are basic residues and cysteines protruding from the Î²-sheet into the
solvent, according to Birse et al. Highly conserved residues are shown in dark gray, residues with conservative substitutions
having the same physico-chemical properties are shown in light gray. Where organism names are given (Saccharomyces, C. albicans, N. crassa and S. pombe) they refer to the SRP21 proteins identified in this work whereas the SRP9 and SRP14 proteins are
denoted by their Swissprot/TREMBL names.

[32] and the alignment of SRP9 to SRP21 was the result of
a CLUSTALW analysis which was consistent with the
results obtained from the profile searches described
above. Interestingly, many of the positions that were conserved in the SRP9/14 structural alignment [32] were
occupied by the same category of amino acids in the
SRP21 proteins (Fig. 5). These data indicated that SRP21
is structurally similar to the SRP9/14 proteins and provided further evidence of the homology between SRP21
and SRP9.
In mammalian SRP, proteins SRP9 and SRP14 were
shown to form a heterodimer and share a Î±Î²Î²Î²Î± topology
[32]. To determine if the secondary structure predicted for

fungal SRP21 was similar to the SRP9 and SRP14 structure, we made predictions with PSIPRED [33,34]. Saccharomyces SRP21 sequences were used as input and the
results are shown in Fig. 7. For human SRP9 and SRP14
the boxed regions indicate the positions of the secondary
structure elements as known from the structure of the
proteins. The corresponding regions for the fungal proteins are also shown in boxes and are based on the alignment in Fig. 5. The results showed that the predicted
secondary structure of SRP21 was remarkably similar to
the predicted or known structures of SRP9 and SRP14.
With the exception of the first Î±-helix of Saccharomyces
SRP21 all the predicted secondary structure elements were
consistent with those of the SRP9/14 structure. Similar

Protein secondary structure predictions of SRP21, SRP9 and SRP14 proteins
Protein secondary structure predictions of SRP21, SRP9 and SRP14 proteins. Protein sequences, SRP21 and potential homologs from the organisms indicated as well as human SRP9 and SRP14, were subjected to secondary structure prediction by PSI-PRED [33]. Sequences and predictions are shown unaligned. Î±-helices and Î²-strands are indicated by cylinders and
arrows, respectively. For human SRP9 and SRP14 the boxed regions indicate the positions of the secondary structure elements
as known from the structure of the proteins. The corresponding regions for the fungal proteins are also shown in boxes and
are based on the alignment in Fig. 5.

Potential interactions of yeast SRP21
In metazoan cells, SRP9/14 forms a complex with the Alu
domain of SRP RNA. The structure of this complex has
been determined at high resolution [5,32]. On the other
hand, the Alu domain of yeast is less well characterized.
An analysis of yeast SRP showed that it was missing an
obvious SRP9 homolog [11]. SRP21 was not believed to
be the SRP9 equivalent in yeast because its sequence similarity to SRP9 was not recognized and SRP21 did not
appear to be stably associated with SRP14. Furthermore,
evidence was provided that SRP14 is present in two copies
in the yeast SRP [3] and SRP14 was shown to form a
homodimer which bound to the Alu domain [25]. On the
basis of these observations it was assumed that the SRP14
homodimer was functionally equivalent to the SRP9/14
heterodimer. In contrast, we suggest that SRP21 is not
only structurally but also functionally related to SRP9. We
suggest that the protein is an integral component not only
of Saccharomyces, but of every yeast SRP. In the light of
these findings it will be important to reexamine experimentally the role of SRP21 in yeast.

Conclusions
In the process of identifying and analyzing numerous SRP
RNAs in protozoa and fungi we have demonstrated that
the RNA portion of the Alu domain is highly variable both
in sequence and secondary structure. Although the RNAs
possess a conserved UGUNR motif, other parts of the Alu
domain show a large degree of variation. One striking
example of the plasticity of Alu is apparent in the Alveolates where the Plasmodium Alu domain is distinct from all
other members of that group. Furthermore, in fungi the
Alu domain is a simple hairpin motif as compared to all
other species where the Alu domain is more elaborate. We
have also identified secondary structure element
insertions in the Sacccharomyces SRP RNAs towards the terminal regions which could be considered as expansions of
the Alu domain.
The Alu associated SRP9 and SRP14 proteins appear to
have been subject to rapid evolution as well. One example
is the evolution of the fungal SRP21 protein. Using sensitive profile-based searches, we have presented evidence
that SRP21 is homologous to the metazoan SRP9. In addi-

tion, it seems that SRP9 and SRP14 are missing in some
protozoa and fungi, and it is known from previous studies
that the Bacillus type eubacteria are missing these proteins
and sequence analysis has so far failed to reveal archaebacterial homologs. Based on these findings it is tempting
to speculate that the ancestral Alu domain was built solely
from RNA, and proteins SRP9/14 were added to adjust
Alu function in subsequent evolutionary events.

Methods
Sources of genomic sequences
Some of the genomic sequences used in this work were
unfinished sequences and represent as yet unpublished
material. In these cases permission to present the results
in this paper was obtained from the respective research
groups. SRP RNA sequences from S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. bayanus, S. castellii and S. kluyveri were retrieved
using BLAST searches against the corresponding genomes
using the S. cerevisiae sequence as query using the BLAST
server at the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington
University
http://www.genome.wustl.edu/blast/
yeast_client.cgi. Saccharomyces protein sequences were
identified using the same BLAST server and the Synteny
viewer at the Saccharomyces Genome Database http://
www.yeastgenome.org. Sequences of Candida albicans
were from the Stanford Genome Technology Center website at http://www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida
(Assembly 6). Neurospora sequences were from the Neurospora Sequencing Project, Whitehead Institute/MIT
Center
for
Genome
Research
http://wwwgenome.wi.mit.edu. The dataset used in these studies was
http://www.broad.mit.edu/ftp/pub/annotation/neu
rospora/assembly3/neurospora_3.fasta.gz. Aspergillus nidulans sequences were downloaded from the Whitehead

Identification of SRP RNA sequences and prediction of
RNA secondary structure
SRP RNA genes were predicted as described previously
[14] by applying a combination of pattern searches using
rnabob
http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software/
#rnabob and COVE [15]. The rnabob searches made use
of descriptors based on consensus features of the helix 8
region of the RNA. The search pattern was typically (XX)
YYAGR (NNN) GRRA (N'N'N') AGCAR (X'X') or minor
variations of it, where X pairs with X' and N with N'. RNA
secondary structure predictions were carried out by COVE
and MFOLD [16] and were complemented by analysis of
compensatory base changes [36]. Saccharomyces RNAs
were first aligned with CLUSTALW [37] using a gap extension penalty of 0, and this alignment was manually edited
to be consistent with observations from MFOLD predictions to assure that bases involved in the formation of helices were properly aligned.
Identification and analysis of SRP protein sequences
The program 'sixpack' of the EMBOSS package [38] was
used to obtain all possible translation products of genome
sequences. PROFILESEARCH was part of the GCG package (Wisconsin package version 10.2, Genetics Computer
Group (GCG), Madison, Wisc.). Hmmer package, developed by S. Eddy, was obtained from http://
hmmer.wustl.edu/. Genscan was downloaded from http:/
/genes.mit.edu/GENSCANinfo.html and GlimmerM from
http://www.tigr.org/software/glimmerm/. Protein secondary structure was predicted using PSIPRED [33,34]
and SAM-T02 [35].

All predicted RNA and protein sequences, secondary structures and multiple alignments are shown in a web supplement at http://bio.lundberg.gu.se/srp03/.
