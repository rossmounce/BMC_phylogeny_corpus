Abstract
Background: SPOUT methyltransferases (MTases) are a large class of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent enzymes that
exhibit an unusual alpha/beta fold with a very deep topological knot. In 2001, when no crystal structures were available for any
of these proteins, Anantharaman, Koonin, and Aravind identified homology between SpoU and TrmD MTases and defined the
SPOUT superfamily. Since then, multiple crystal structures of knotted MTases have been solved and numerous new homologous
sequences appeared in the databases. However, no comprehensive comparative analysis of these proteins has been carried out
to classify them based on structural and evolutionary criteria and to guide functional predictions.
Results: We carried out extensive searches of databases of protein structures and sequences to collect all members of
previously identified SPOUT MTases, and to identify previously unknown homologs. Based on sequence clustering,
characterization of domain architecture, structure predictions and sequence/structure comparisons, we re-defined families
within the SPOUT superfamily and predicted putative active sites and biochemical functions for the so far uncharacterized
members. We have also delineated the common core of SPOUT MTases and inferred a multiple sequence alignment for the
conserved knot region, from which we calculated the phylogenetic tree of the superfamily. We have also studied phylogenetic
distribution of different families, and used this information to infer the evolutionary history of the SPOUT superfamily.
Conclusion: We present the first phylogenetic tree of the SPOUT superfamily since it was defined, together with a new scheme
for its classification, and discussion about conservation of sequence and structure in different families, and their functional
implications. We identified four protein families as new members of the SPOUT superfamily. Three of these families are
functionally uncharacterized (COG1772, COG1901, and COG4080), and one (COG1756 represented by Nep1p) has been
already implicated in RNA metabolism, but its biochemical function has been unknown. Based on the inference of orthologous
and paralogous relationships between all SPOUT families we propose that the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all
extant organisms contained at least three SPOUT members, ancestors of contemporary RNA MTases that carry out m1G, m3U,
and 2'O-ribose methylation, respectively. In this work we also speculate on the origin of the knot and propose possible
'unknotted' ancestors. The results of our analysis provide a comprehensive 'roadmap' for experimental characterization of
SPOUT MTases and interpretation of functional studies in the light of sequence-structure relationships.

Background
SPOUT methyltransferases (MTases) [1] are a large class of
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent enzymes
that exhibit an unusual fold with a very deep topological
knot [2,3]. Historically, it has been the 4th unrelated type
of AdoMet-dependent MTase structure determined by Xray crystallography, hence named 'class IV' (review: [4]).
SPOUT homologs are present in multiple copies in all
proteomes [1,5] and among AdoMet-dependent MTases
are outnumbered only by the class I, Rossmann-fold
MTases (RFM) [6,7]. Nonetheless, only a few SPOUT
members have been characterized functionally. Thus far,
all of them have been found to be involved in posttranscriptional RNA modification and introduce methylation
of 2'-OH groups of ribose (in tRNA – Trm3 [8], TrmH [9],
or rRNA – RlmB [3]), or the N-1 atom of guanosine 37 in
tRNA (TrmD, [10,11]), or the N-3 atom of uridine 1498
in 16S rRNA (RsmE; [12]). During the last few years, a
number of crystal structures solved by the structural
genomics initiative revealed a common fold of SPOUT
MTases, the so-called 'α/β knot fold', also in members of
uncharacterized protein families. Currently (January
2007), the majority of members of this fold listed in the
SCOP database [13] are proteins with uncharacterized
function, and it is likely that this fraction will continue to
grow with the progress of structural genomics. For simplicity, in this work each domain with the 'α/β knot' fold,
determined experimentally or predicted computationally,
will be referred to as the SPOUT domain. All evidence suggests that bona fide SPOUT MTases and structurally similar
but functionally uncharacterized proteins are homologous and should be classified within the same superfamily. Consequently, the whole group of proteins with
the SPOUT domain will be referred to as the 'SPOUT
superfamily', regardless of the level of their functional
characterization and degree of sequence similarity to previously identified SPOUT MTases.
Among the few experimental studies on SPOUT enzymes,
two focused on characterization of potential active sites
identified in the structures of TrmH [14,15] and TrmD
[11], providing insight into the role of amino acids conserved within these two families of SPOUT MTases. However, since the pioneering sequence analysis of
Anantharaman et al., which was done before any structures of SPOUT MTases were available [1], no comprehensive comparative analysis of sequence conservation
between these proteins and other (uncharacterized) members was carried out. Thus, molecular determinants of different catalytic mechanisms in other SPOUT MTases
remain completely unknown. Without this knowledge, it
is very difficult to make predictions about the molecular
function of experimentally uncharacterized members of
the SPOUT superfamily, including those with structures
solved by structural genomics. It is also tempting to spec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

ulate that other protein families without available structures and with no obvious sequence similarity to known
members may belong to the SPOUT superfamily and still
await discovery. Finally, the evolutionary origin of this
strongly conserved fold, and especially its deep topological knot, is unknown.
Motivated by the scale of what is unknown about the
SPOUT superfamily, we carried out a search for all its
members, followed by comprehensive sequence and
structure analyses. The aim of this study was to provide a
structural and evolutionary classification of SPOUT proteins that will serve as a guide for analyses of sequencestructure-function relationships, and to make structural
and functional predictions for individual proteins that
will stimulate their experimental characterization.

Results
Structural features of known members of the SPOUT
superfamily
We collected all crystal structures of known members of
the SPOUT superfamily annotated in the SCOP database
[13] as the 'α/β knot superfamily'. These structures were
used to search the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with DALI
[16] and SSM [17] to identify additional proteins with
similar topology. The resulting dataset was purged to
retain only one structure per protein (preference was given
to native proteins over ones with selenomethionine, and
to those with the highest resolution) yielding 19 nonredundant protein structures, including 2ha8, 1zjr and
1x7o that were not present in SCOP. Table 1 shows DALI
scores describing their mutual similarities.

Subsequently, we assigned SPOUT structures to sequence
alignments of previously identified SPOUT-related families: SpoU, Aq_054, AF2226, TrmD, YbeA [1], and
DUF431 [18]. Structures with no matches to these 'old'
SPOUT families were regarded as founding members of
new families and used to identify the respective alignments in the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups)
database using PSI-BLAST. For families with structurally
characterized representatives, secondary structure was
assigned to the alignment according to DSSP. For the
remaining previously known SPOUT families (COG0336,
COG0565, COG1303, COG1385, COG1818, COG2419,
COG2428, and COG4752) we carried out secondary and
tertiary structure prediction and built comparative models
(see Methods) and assigned the secondary structure to the
alignments based on the predictions.
Comparison of SPOUT domains reveals the presence of a
common core, comprising a parallel β-sheet of 5 strands,
sandwiched between two layers of helices (Figure 1). The
SPOUT domain can be subdivided into the variable N-terminal subdomain with a Rossmanoidal α/β fold, and the

Structures are described by their PDB IDs. Pairwise structural similarities according to the DALI Z-score (number of standard deviations above the expectation for unrelated structures) are listed, highest
values are indicated by black (Z ≥ 15) or grey background (15 > Z ≥ 11). The highest similarity (black shading) correlates very well with membership in different SCOP families within the "α/β knot
superfamily".

Table 1: Similarities Between all SPOUT Structures Detectable With DALI

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:73

conserved C-terminal trefoil knot (also exhibiting the α/β
structure) that binds AdoMet. The structure of a putative
MTase SAV0024/SA0023 from Staphylococcus aureus (1vh0
in the Protein Data Bank, PDB) is an example of a SPOUT
member that contains only the core elements. Even in the
universally conserved core the helices vary greatly in size
and angle with respect to each other and to the β-sheet
and often cannot be simultaneously superimposed if
strongly diverged members are compared (data not
shown). In many members (e.g. TrmH, RlmB, RsmE) the
core is extended by addition of one α/β module to the Nterminal subdomain (right edge of the β-sheet in Figure
1). On the other hand, the α/β module on the other side
of the β-sheet shows significant variability in the content
of regular secondary structure, despite topological conservation, resulting in apparent 'melting' of a β-strand into a
loop or shrinking of the α-helix (Figure 1).
All SPOUT members studied to date were found to be
dimers, with a large surface area buried upon dimerization. In all structures, the cofactor-binding loop in the
knot of one monomer is stabilized by interactions with
the other monomer. Moreover, the active sites are formed
by residues from both monomers, suggesting that dimerization is essential for the MTase activity. Interestingly, different SPOUT structures exhibit different modes of
dimerization. For instance, in the dimers formed by RlmB,
TrmH, RrmA, YibK, RsmE, and MT1, the two sheets are
oriented in a nearly perpendicular way, while in TrmD
and YbeA they are antiparallel (Figure 2.)
Many SPOUT members exhibit additional domains fused
to the N- or C-termini or inserted into a linker between
the two subdomains (Figure 3). Interestingly, most of
these domains belong to various superfamilies of common nucleic acid binding domains, such as PUA,
THUMP, OB-fold, or L30e [19-21], or hydrolases implicated in metabolism of nucleic acids, such as the PD-(D/
E)XK nuclease superfamily [22], the GIY-YIG nuclease
superfamily [23], or the HD metal-dependent phosphohydrolase superfamily [24]. These domain fusions
strongly suggest that the SPOUT superfamily is involved
primarily in binding and enzymatic modification of
nucleic acids, unlike other MTase superfamilies that are
either very promiscuous or specialize in methylation of
proteins or small molecules [4,5].
Identification of new members of the SPOUT superfamily
We used HHsearch [25] to convert alignments of the
known SPOUT families into profile-Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that include both the sequences and secondary structure, and we used them to identify other
potentially homologous families. The HHpred method
for HMM-HMM comparisons was used to search a database of profile-HMMs corresponding to multiple

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

sequence alignments obtained from the COG, KOG, and
PFAM databases, also with predicted secondary structures.
Based on the results of the HMM-HMM comparison, and
in particular the list of 'hits' with significant P-value (<
0.0001) and scores (>15.0), we generated a preliminary
list of new candidate SPOUT families. These parameters
were chosen to detect as many protein families with
remote similarity to SPOUT as possible, including possibly all true homologs that had to be confirmed by more
refined analyses, as well as unavoidable false positives
that had to be removed in subsequent steps of the analysis.
The preliminary candidates were initially validated by
reciprocal HHsearches against the database comprising
both the initial query profile-HMMs as well as all the
other COG, KOG, and PFAM profile HMMs. If a region of
sequence that initially seemed to be similar to known
SPOUT members displayed evident strong similarity to
some other family, known to be unrelated to SPOUT, then
a given family was regarded as a false positive and
removed from the list of SPOUT candidates. Each candidate family, for which the relationship to known SPOUTs
was confirmed by reciprocal searches, was also analyzed
by fold-recognition (FR) methods via the GeneSilico
metaserver [26]. This step served to test whether the
sequence of the new candidate is compatible with the 'α/
β knot' fold or with some other unrelated structure.
Finally, comparative models were built for the parts of the
sequence aligned by the FR methods to the template structures and the sequence conservation was analyzed in the
structural context to detect potential active site residues.
Ultimately, our analysis revealed that so far uncharacterized (or poorly characterized) and structurally unclassified families COG1756 (archaeal and eukaryotic proteins
represented by Nep1p), COG1772 (archaeal proteins represented by PF0315), COG1901 (archaeal proteins represented by PF1403), and COG4080 (archaeal protein
represented by MJ1199), are related to SPOUT MTases
and share the characteristic "α/β knot" structure. Below
we report the supporting evidence for the SPOUT fold prediction obtained from the FR analysis. Detailed structural
predictions and the resulting functional implications for
these new members of the SPOUT superfamily will be
described in the following sections devoted to evolutionary analyses.
COG1756 (representative: Nep1p)
The profile-HMM analysis confidently identified a relationship (P-value 1.4*10-4) between the C-terminal
domain of COG1756 (aa 150–298) and the TrmD family
(COG0366), as well as other SPOUT families, albeit with
lower scores. The FR analysis identified SPOUT structures,
mainly 1o6d and 1ns5 from the YbeA family (COG1576),

sequences, with good agreement of alignments reported
by different servers despite moderate scores (mGenTHREADER: score 0.436, SAM-T02: score 0.56, 3DPSSM:
score: 0.7). The consensus predictor PCONS selected
1o6d as a preferred template (score 1.427).
COG1772 (PF04407, DUF531; representative: PF0315)

COG0565 (TrmJ family) with P-values: 1.3*10-4 and
4.5*10-4 respectively, and a more remote similarity to
COG0566 (P-value 1.3*10-3). The FR analysis identified
the SPOUT domain of COG0566 members: RlmB (1gz0),
RrmA (1ipa), and AviRb (1x7o) as the potentially best
modeling templates for COG1772 sequences, although

positions, score 1.045–1.4837). Importantly, COG1772
proteins lack the L30e-like N-terminal domain common
to these preferred templates and therefore comprises only
the SPOUT domain.

COG4080 (representatives: MJ1199, APE2001)
The profile-HMM comparison revealed a close relationship of COG4080 to COG0565 (probability: 93.2%, Pvalue: 3.3*10-7) and slightly more remote connection to
COG0566, COG0219, and COG1303 (probability > 82%
and P-values ~ 10-5). The FR analysis carried out for
COG4080 identified structures of COG0566 proteins as
the best templates, even though COG4080 members lack
the L30e-like domain. The best-scoring templates were:
1gz0 (INBGU: 139.24, mGenTHREADER: 0.687, FFAS: 15.6). 1v2x (INBGU: 139.69, 3DPSSM: 0.058, FFAS: 13.4), and 1j85 (INBGU: 127.32, mGenTHREADER:
0.675, FFAS: -17.9. These results suggest that the previous
annotation of COG4080 "RecB-family nuclease [DNA
replication, recombination, and repair]" is probably spurious, as these proteins comprise exclusively the SPOUT
domain and are definitely unrelated to the RecB family.
COG1901 (PF04013; DUF358), representative: PF1403)
The HHsearch analysis revealed that COG1901 displays
close relationships to COG1756 (probability: 88.8% and
P-value:5.3*10-6) and COG1385 (probability: 80.6% and

P-value:1.1*10-5). Most FR servers identified 1j85
(COG0219) as the best template with high scores
(SPARKS: -2.53, mGenTHREADER: 0.476, consensus servers Pcons2: 0.719 and Pcons5: 0,829). Other highly
scored templates belonged to COG1385 (1vhk/1vxz/

FUGUE: 3.92.
We used the newly identified SPOUT families as queries to
carry out additional profile-HMM searches, but no new

families could be identified to show similarity to the
expanded SPOUT dataset. We observed no new relationships even when all (old and new) profiles were enriched
with additional sequences identified in PSI-BLAST
searches (see below). This suggests that we obtained a
comprehensive representation of the SPOUT superfamily
and if any homologous families remain undetected, they
must exhibit extreme divergence from sequences analyzed
in this work.

Clustering analysis of the SPOUT superfamily
To identify a complete set of SPOUT sequences (beyond
those included in the COG or PFAM alignments), we used
representatives of all families to carry out exhaustive PSIBLAST searches of the nr database (until convergence) and
retrieved all sequences reported with e-value < 10-3. After
removing obvious duplicates (identical proteins retrieved
in different searches), we obtained a set of over 1900
sequences. Because such a large number of sequences are
very difficult to handle, we decided to generate a preliminary classification and refine the alignments independently for each family, and only then to carry out the
evolutionary analysis. Clustering of all full-length SPOUT
sequences was performed based on their pair-wise BLAST
similarity scores, using CLANS [27]. We have experimentally found that for this particular dataset the P-value
threshold of 10-3 produced qualitatively best results (more
stringent values caused disconnection of the most
diverged families, while more permissive values caused
over-compaction of the whole dataset into a single cluster
with only a few outliers). This simple clustering was
remarkably effective, as it produced a clear-cut separation
of most original COGs and their close homologs found by
PSI-BLAST into 18 distinct clusters. Based on the results of
preliminary clustering, we extracted members of individual families and calculated multiple sequence alignments
using MUSCLE [28] and refined them manually (as
described in Methods) to remove truncated sequences and
redundant, nearly identical versions of the same protein,
and to improve the placement of insertions and deletions.
We used these refined alignments to re-scan the database
of profile-HMMs using HHSearch, but the results were
qualitatively similar to those obtained with the original
alignments obtained from the COG and PFAM database
(e.g. the same set of SPOUT families were identified, with
similar scores).

While refining the alignment of TrmD homologs
(COG0336), we discovered that three sequences
(DVU0836 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, LI0220 from Lawsonia intracellularis, and MldDRAFT_4740 from Deltaproteobacterium MLMS-1) comprise a fusion of the TrmDlike domain with a second SPOUT domain that belongs to
COG4752 (Figure 3). In order to avoid artificial bridging
of COG0336 and COG4752 by these fusion proteins,
their sequences were split into two separate parts and the
clustering of the SPOUT superfamily was repeated (Figure
4). Subsequently, we carried out a separate analysis for the
largest central supercluster, which groups together
strongly interconnected members of COG565, COG0566,
and COG0219. At the P-value threshold of 10-6 and lower,
this supercluster was split into five subclusters, corresponding to COG565, COG0219, and three subfamilies
of COG0566 we termed A, B, and C (Figure 5). In
COG0566A we also included a group of apparent outliers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

which formed loosely connected subclusters at the
periphery of COG0556.
The final, refined set of all SPOUT members comprised
1629 sequences, grouped into 18 families (COGs) shown
in Table 2. The phylogenetic distribution of their members has been analyzed using an in-house Python script
and is shown in Figure 6. Interestingly, no single family is
found to span all taxons, in all three Domains of Life.
Based on the superposition of structurally characterized
SPOUT members, pairwise family-family alignments
obtained using HHSearch and sequence-structure alignments produced by FR methods (see above) we generated
a multiple sequence alignment of representatives of all
SPOUT COGs (Figure 7). It illustrates the weak conservation of amino acid residues in the structurally conserved
AdoMet-binding site and very strong variability of other
regions between most families. This analysis shows that
SPOUT MTases do not share a universally conserved
active site, and suggests that different families developed
specialized versions of catalytic pockets to carry out methylations of their substrates. It is therefore important to
find out if different families that exhibit similar activities
on different substrates (e.g. methylation of ribose in different RNAs or N1-methylation of guanosine in positions
37 and 9 of tRNA) possess similar or different active sites.
The central 'supercluster' groups together ribose 2'-OMTases
The central supercluster (Figure 5) is formed by
COG0219, COG0565, and COG0566 families. COG0219
groups together bacterial proteins represented by the
putative MTase YibK from Haemophilus influenzae (1mxi in
the Protein Data Bank [29]). Members of the YibK family
contain only the SPOUT domain. COG0565 comprises
bacterial and archaeal proteins exemplified here by the
uncharacterized protein LasT and the recently characterized tRNA:Xm32 MTase (TrmJ) from E. coli [30]. All members of COG0565 contain the SPOUT domain with a Cterminal helical extension of unknown function, which
may form an independently folded domain [30]. Surprisingly, a few functionally uncharacterized members of
COG0565 contain also putative deoxyribonuclease
domains: ELI_05635 from E. litoralis has an N-terminally
fused GIY-YIG domain [23], while a small group of proteins from Alphaproteobacteria exemplified by bll5746
from B. japonicum have a C-terminally fused PD-(D/E)XK
domain [31]. Orthologs of this PD-(D/E)XK domain
(DUF559) in other Alphaproteobacteria are standalone
open reading frames. It will be interesting to determine
the function of these nuclease domains and find out if
their activity is linked with the MTase activity of the
SPOUT
domain.

As mentioned above, the largest COG0566 was split into
three subfamilies termed A, B, and C. All three subfamilies
contain eukaryotic and bacterial proteins, and only one
member from Archaea. COG0566A comprises orthologs
of tRNA:Gm18 MTase (TrmH, EC 2.1.1.34) and is represented by a protein from Thermus thermophilus (1v2x in
PDB [9]). Prokaryotic members of this subfamily contain
only the catalytic domain, with short helical extensions at
both termini, which do not form an independent domain.
Eukaryotic members of COG0566A, including Trm3p
from S. cerevisiae, which exhibit the same specificity as
TrmH [8], lack the short helical extensions, but contain
very long (often > 1000 aa) N-terminal domain of
unknown function, predicted to contain multiple α-helices that may form a large superhelix. COG0566B comprises orthologs of 23S rRNA:Gm2251 MTase RlmB from
E. coli (1gz0 [3]) and a paralogous lineage, comprising
products of an apparent duplication within Gammaproteobacteria, exemplified by a hypothetical ribose MTase
YfiF from E. coli [32]. Eukaryotic members are represented
by the TAR (HIV) RNA binding protein 1 (TRBP1) in
humans (2ha8 in PDB), and its ortholog Mrm1p (formerly Pet56p) in S. cerevisiae, which introduces a highly
conserved Gm2270 modification in mitochondrial 21S
rRNA (corresponding to Gm2251 in bacterial 23S rRNA)
and has an essential role in the maturation of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit that is independent of
its MTase activity [33]. This additional essential role of
Mrm1p is not shared by RlmB, which is dispensable in E.
coli [34]. COG0566C comprises close homologs of 23S
rRNA:Um2479 MTase AviRb from Streptomyces viridochromogenes (1x7o in PDB [35]), including the functionally
uncharacterized, putative 2'-O-ribose MTase RrmA from
T. thermophilus (1ipa [2]), and the human protein
RNMTL1. In both COG0566B and COG0566C the
SPOUT domain is N-terminally fused to the L30e-like
domain, which is probably involved in RNA binding.
Interestingly, eukaryotic members of COG0566B, many
eukaryotic members of COG0566C, as well as YfiF and its
orthologs from COG0556B, but not other members of
these families, contain an N-terminal positively charged
(presumably disordered) N-terminal extension.
Our classification of proteins from the central supercluster
partially differs from that proposed by Anantharaman et
al. in the original article that defined the SPOUT superfamily [1]. The previously defined "SpoU family 1" overlaps not only with all three subfamilies of COG0566
proposed here, but also with COG0219 and a part of
COG565, while the other part of COG0565 was suggested
to be a separate "SpoU family 2". Our results clearly suggest that proteins such as MJ1476 (GI:15669668) belong
to a separate family together with TrmJ (formerly YfhQ)
and LasT from E. coli (COG0565) rather than with members of COG0566, as originally proposed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

Superposition of crystal structures and analysis of the
resulting sequence alignment (Figure 7) reveals that all
members of COG0219, COG0565, and COG0566 families share a common set of residues implicated in catalysis, delivered by both subunits in a dimer (e.g. R41 and
S150 in TrmH) [14,35], which suggests that they are all
active as RNA 2'-O-ribose MTases. We have experimentally verified this prediction for the YfhQ protein from E.
coli, which was found to exhibit the tRNA:Xm32 MTase
(TrmJ) activity [30].
Other genuine and potential RNA 2'-O-ribose MTases
In the CLANS analysis of SPOUT protein (Figure 4), the
core group is surrounded by four clusters: COG04752,
COG4080, COG1772, and COG1303. COG4752 is a
small family comprising a few bacterial proteins with
erratic phyletic distribution, mostly from extremophiles
(e.g. Thermotoga maritima, Synthropus acidotrophicus), but
also from pathogens such as Fusibacterium nucleatum
COG4752 was dubbed 'SpoU family 5' by Anantharaman
et al. [1], implying a functional link with 2'-O-ribose
MTases. On the other hand, COG4080 and COG1772 are
identified as SPOUT superfamily members and predicted
as MTases only in this work. COG4080 is a small family
of archaeal proteins, it consists only of the SPOUT
domain. As mentioned earlier, these proteins have been
incorrectly classified in sequence databases as homologous to RecB. COG1772 is a small family of functionally
uncharacterized proteins mostly from hyperthermophilic
Euryarchaeota, represented here by PF0315 from Pyrococcus furiosus. COG1303 is the last 'satellite' of the supercluster. This exclusively archaeal family is represented here by
the PAB1040 (GI: 14521775/5458995) protein from
Pyrococcus abyssi, which was recently found to introduce
the Archaea-specific 2'-O-metylation of C56 in tRNA [36].

Analysis of sequence conservation in COG4752,
COG4080, COG1772, and COG1303 families (Figure 7)
with the aid of comparative models of the representative
proteins (data not shown) reveals that COG4752 and
COG1303 exhibit a conserved Arg residue at the same
position as the catalytic Arg of the orthodox 'supercluster'
members. COG1772 members possess conserved Arg residues in the same helix (R36 and R32 in the representative
sequence PF0315). Their shift by one and two turns (3
and 7 residues) towards the N-terminus with respect to
the position equivalent to R41 of TrmH could be either
genuine or an alignment/modeling artifact; nonetheless,
it can be reliably predicted that the long side chain(s) of
the conserved Arg residue(s) in COG1772 could assume a
similar spatial position to the catalytic Arg of bona fide
ribose MTases. Members of COG1772 also possess a conserved Ser (S166 in PF0315) at a position homologous to
the catalytic Ser of the 'supercluster', while members of
COG4752 possess a conserved Ser at the position of con-

all families of size >50 we used the PURGE option of the Gibbs motif sampler [84] to identify 50 representative sequences with
the maximal sequence divergence. However, the results of CLANS analyses for this 'representative' set of SPOUT members
were very similar to those obtained for the full dataset (data not shown).

served Ser in COG1303 (i.e. 2 residues towards the C-terminus compared to members of the 'supercluster').
Altogether, this suggests that the putative active sites of
COG1772 and COG4752 are similar to those of genuine
2'-O-ribose MTases (COG0565/0566/1303) and therefore these proteins are likely to exhibit a similar activity.
On the other hand, members of COG4080 do not seem to
possess any conserved Arg or Ser residues at positions
equivalent to those characteristic for 2'-O-ribose MTases,
which suggests that despite their close relationship to
COG0565/0566/0219, they may exhibit a different function.
Among other SPOUT families, only the eukaryo-archaeal
COG1818, dubbed "SpoU family 4" by Anantharaman et

al. [1], exhibits conserved Arg and Thr residues (R197 and
T328 in PF1925, common to bona fide 2'-O-ribose
MTases (Figure 7). Therefore, we predict these proteins are
also involved in ribose methylation.
COG2106 appears to be an outlier. It groups together
functionally uncharacterized proteins from Archaea and
Eukaryota, of which one (functionally uncharacterized
putative MTase MT1 from Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus) had a structure determined by the structural
genomics factory (1k3r in PDB, [37]). A characteristic feature of this family is an insertion of the OB-fold domain
[19] into the SPOUT domain. MT1 dimerizes in a perpendicular fashion, similar to 2'-O-MTases. It also exhibits a
conserved Arg common to the catalytic Arg of 2'-O-

MTases (R33 in MT1, replaced with Lys only in a few
eukaryotic members of COG2106), and has a conserved
(but not invariant) Thr residue (T243) at the position of
the catalytic S150 of TrmH. Thus, methylation of ribose
appears to be a possible function of MT1 and other members of COG2106, but at this point other activities cannot
be excluded (and in fact, phylogenetic considerations suggest that COG2106 may be orthologous to bacterial m3U
MTases from COG1385, see below). Interestingly,
COG2106 has two members in S. cerevisiae, Ygr283cp and
Ymr310cp, of which the latter appears to be more
diverged (Figure 7). It remains to be verified experimentally, if these two yeast proteins are independent enzymes
with similar functions but perhaps different specificities,
or if they form a heterodimer in which each subunit fulfills a slightly different function, as has been found for
other yeast RNA modification and processing enzymes,
including tRNA:m1A58 MTase Trm6p/Trm62p [38], tRNA
deaminase Tad2p/Tad3p that converts A34 to inosine

[39], or a heterotetrameric intron-splicing nuclease Sen
[40].
Matching of predicted 2'-O-ribose MTases and known
ribose methylation sites
The remaining predicted but still unproven 2'-O-ribose
MTases from the SPOUT superfamily in E. coli include
YibK, LasT, and YfiF, which all belong to the 'supercluster'.
The fourth predicted 2'-O-ribose MTase in E. coli is
encoded by the ygdE gene, and belongs to the unrelated
RFM superfamily [41]. On the other hand, there are four
known sites of ribose methylation in E. coli RNA, for
which no enzyme/ORF has been assigned yet: a monomethylated residue Cm at position 2498 in 23S rRNA, a
dimethylated residue m4Cm at position 1402 in 16S
rRNA, Cm at position 34 in tRNALeu5, and a hypermodified nucleoside 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-O-methyluridine (cmnm5Um) at position 34 in tRNALeu4 [42,43].
It remains to be determined experimentally, if these four

1. DALI Z-score > 15 in pairwise similarities: this feature clearly distinguishes four members of the 'supercluster' (COG0566 and COG0219,
state 1) from other SPOUT structures (states 2–5). 2. DALI Z-score > 11 in pairwise similarities: this feature allows to split the SPOUT
structures into two groups: COG0566, COG0219, COG2106, and COG1385 (state 1) vs COG0336 and COG1576 (state 2). 3. Dimerization
mode (perpendicular vs antiparallel): this feature disregards the similarity of monomers, but focuses on their mutual orientation. As discussed
earlier (see Figure 2), members of COG0566, COG0219, COG2106, and COG1385 form 'perpendicular' dimers (state 1), while members of
COG0336 and COG1576 form 'antiparallel' dimers (state 2). 4. HHpred P-value < 1e-4 in pairwise similarities: this feature assigns state 1 to
COG0556, COG0219, COG0565, COG4080, COG1303, COG4752, and COG1772, state 2 to a pair of COG1385 and COG1901, and states 3–9
to all other COGs, regarded as 'singletons'. 5. Clustering according to CLANS: here, states were arbitrarily assigned according to the visual
analysis of CLANS results (Figure 4). This grouping identifies nearly the same group of closely related families as feature 4 (with the exception of
inclusion of COG1818 and removal of COG1772), but allows additions groupings, in particular COG0336 with COG1576 (state 3) and COG2419
with COG2428 (state 4). Singletons are assigned states 5–7. 6. Methylation product: assigned based on experimental data. State 1: 2'-O-ribose,
state 2: m1G, state 3: m3U. 7. Active site variant I: conserved Arg or Lys in the N-terminal helix and conserved Ser or Thr in the C-terminal
helix. In this manuscript we predict that these residues may be characteristic for 2'-O-ribose MTases. 8. Active site variant II: conserved Arg or
Lys in the C-terminal helix. This feature may be correlated with the antiparallel dimerization mode (feature 3), which requires 'migration' of the
basic residue in one subunit of the dimer (compared to the 'perpendicular' mode of dimerization) to maintain the interaction with the rest of the
active site in the other subunit. 9. Conserved Glu in the cofactor/methionine-binding loop: the functional significance of this conservation is
unclear; this residue forms an intramolecular salt bridge and seems more important for the structural stability than for catalysis. 10. Insertion (> =
4aa) in a loop that binds adenosine of AdoMet. 11. Insertion (> = 4aa) in a loop that binds methionine of AdoMet. 12. Secondary
structure of the variable Rossmanoidal part of the SPOUT fold: state 1:β-strands, state 0: 2 β-strands.

Phyletic patterns of SPOUT families analyzed in this work, analyzed with respect to the fully sequenced
genomes of organisms from the tree Domains of Life. Full squares correspond to taxons, where at least 50% of fully
sequenced genomes contained the member of a given COG. Note that taxons comprise different numbers of representatives,
e.g. Thermotogales contain only one species, Thermotoga maritima. For taxons with more than one fully sequenced genome, the
presence of a COG member in less than 50% of genomes is indicated by an empty square, and the presence of just a single
member is indicated by a dotted square.

predicted 2'-O-ribose MTases are responsible for the last
four unassigned ribose methylations. In our hands, YibK
and LasT have no activity on the position 34 in tRNALeu5
[30], which further narrows down the prediction of this
activity for YgdE or YfiF. Interestingly, the yfiF gene has
been independently analyzed by de Crecy-Lagard and predicted to encode a tRNA:m2A37 MTase (TrmG) [44] based
on the similarity of its genomic location (58 min of the E.
coli chromosome) with the location experimentally determined for the trmG gene (56–61 min) [45]. While we cannot exclude the possibility that YfiF is involved in m2A
methylation, we would like to note that methylation of an
endocyclic carbon atom (C2 in m2A) is chemically more
difficult than methylation of ribose or of an exocyclic
amino group, and may require a different mechanism,
such as formation of a covalent protein-nucleic acid intermediate that has been observed in m5U or m5C MTases
acting on RNA or DNA [46]. YfiF and its orthologs, however, exhibit conservation of all residues characteristic for
2'O-MTases, and their presumptive active site does not
show any similarity to known MTases acting on endocyclic carbon atoms. We hope our analysis will stimulate
experimental analyses of YfiF that will solve this controversy and provide important piece of data for the ultimate
identification of the gene encoding the TrmG enzyme.

Bacillus subtilis (1vhk in PDB [51]), Tt1573 from T. thermophilus (1v6z in PDB) and Tm1380 from Thermotoga
maritima (1z85 in PDB) have been determined, demonstrating the presence of the characteristic knot, yet without
providing hints as to the details of the molecular function.
All structurally characterized members of COG1385
exhibit the 'extended' version of the core β-sheet (topology 6↑-4↑-5↑-1↑-2↑-3↑) and dimerize in a 'perpendicular' mode similar to 2'-O-MTases. Their characteristic
feature is the N-terminal PUA domain implicated in RNAbinding [20]. Analysis of sequence conservation in the
light of the crystal structures (data not shown) reveals that
the putative active site of RsmE is again located at the subunit interface (R224 in monomer A, and Q141 and perhaps also E101 in monomer B). R224 is homologous to
N152 of TrmH (Figure 7), while the 'swapped' residues
E101 and Q141 are located in the first two N-terminal helices of the SPOUT domain, i.e. differently than the
'swapped' residues of either 2'-O-ribose MTases or the
TrmD family that are located in the C-terminal helix.
According to sequence comparisons by HHsearch and
CLANS, COG1385 appears to be related to the uncharacterized family of proteins present in Archaea, grouped
together in COG1901. However, these two families do
not seem to share conserved residues that could be
involved in catalysis and therefore we cannot reliably predict the function of COG1901 members.

Prediction of specificities for potential ribose MTases from
organisms other than E. coli is unfortunately very difficult
– first, because the total number and positions of all modifications in all RNAs have not been determined for any
other organism and second, because Eukaryota and
Archaea use an additional system of ribose 2'-O-metylation, which is based on a single enzymatic complex,
whose specificity is governed by C/D box small RNAs
[47]. These guide RNAs are not trivial to detect, their complete catalog is not known for any cell [48], and it has
been demonstrated that they may be involved in modification of some nucleosides that in the same or in a very
closely related organism can be also modified by a standard mechanism, involving a site-specific RNA MTase
[36,49]. Thus, the determination of activities of predicted
ribose 2'-O-MTases that lack orthologs in E. coli will
require complementary efforts to determine the number
and position of modifications in the substrate RNAs. In
Archaea and Eukaryota this effort should be also coordinated with identification and characterization of C/D box
small RNAs.

m1G MTases and their relatives
COG0336 comprises exclusively bacterial orthologs of the
tRNA:m1G37 MTase TrmD, here represented by the protein from E. coli (1p9p in the PDB [11]). TrmD is one of
the few members of the SPOUT superfamily that have
been relatively well characterized by site-directed mutagenesis, and its active site is quite well defined [10,11]
even though the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex still remains to be determined. The characteristic features of TrmD are: the "minimal" version of the core βsheet (topology 7↑-5↑-6↑-1↑-2↑), with the Rossmanoidal
domain composed only of two α/β segments, an additional β-hairpin (1↑-2↓), and a small helical C-terminal
domain, which is swapped between the two monomers in
the dimer (Figure 1). As mentioned earlier, TrmD dimers
are formed in an antiparallel way (Figure 2). The active
site of TrmD is also located at the subunit interface and
comprises residues from two monomers: E116, R154, and
D169.

m3U MTases and their relatives
COG1385 is an almost exclusively bacterial family (with
a few members in plants) represented here by the recently
characterized RsmE enzyme from Escherichia coli that carries out N3-methylation of U1498 in 16S rRNA [12]. Crystal structures of COG1385 members RsmE from
Haemophilus influenzae (1vhy in PDB [50]), YqeU from

Of all SPOUT members, only COG1576 exhibits some
obvious similarities to TrmD. This family groups together
mostly bacterial proteins. None of its members have been
characterized functionally. However, four crystal structures have been determined by two structural genomics
consortia: for YbeA from E. coli (1ns5), YydA from Bacillus
subtilis (1to0), SAV0024/SA0023 from S. aureus (1vh0,

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:73

[51]), and Tm0844 from T. maritima (1o6d, [51]).
Remarkably, all these proteins share the "minimal" version of the core β-sheet (topology 5↑-3↑-4↑-1↑-2↑) and
the antiparallel dimerization model with the TrmD family. However, members of COG1576 lack the additional
β-hairpin and the C-terminal domain of TrmD, and therefore they can be regarded as 'minimal' (in the structural
sense) members of the SPOUT superfamily. The available
crystal structures of COG1576 members exhibit also the
smallest dimerization interface, so small that according to
PDB and the Protein Quaternary Structure Database
(PQS) 1o6d has been classified as a monomer, even
though in the crystal it forms protein-protein contacts
with its symmetry mate (-X -Y, Z) that are very similar to
those found in 1ns5, 1to0, and 1vh0 dimers (data not
shown). Members of COG1576 shares a common conserved Arg residue (R142) with TrmD, however their putative active site comprises conserved residues that are not
present in TrmD, including T126, Y152, and H153. Since
the COG1576 family includes a member from E. coli
(YbeA), where all m1G modifications in tRNA and rRNA
have been linked to the respective enzymes, it is unlikely
that these proteins carry out N1-methylation of guanosine. However, they may be involved in generation of a
chemically similar product with a methylated endocyclic
nitrogen atom, e.g. m3Ψ1915 in 23S rRNA.
Sequence analysis of COG2419 (represented by the
tRNA:m1G9 MTase Trm10 [52]) reveals virtually no common conserved residues with the functionally similar
tRNA:m1G37 MTase TrmD (Figure 7). This implies that
m1G methylation either appeared independently at least
two times in the history of SPOUT MTases or that considerable sequence divergence has led to a complete redesign
of MTase-guanosine interactions since the putative ancestral m1G MTase that has given rise to the TrmD
(COG0336) and Trm10p (COG2419) families. The independent origin of the same catalytic activity has been
already reported for unrelated enzymes from the Rossmann-fold MTase (RFM) superfamily, namely the eubacterial RlmA family specific for N1-methylation of G745 or
G748 in 23S rRNA [53,54] and archaeo-eukaryotic Trm5
family specific for G37 in tRNA (i.e. analogous to TrmD in
bacteria [55]), which possess very different active sites for
the same reaction (our unpublished data). Interestingly,
COG2419 does not seem to share any strongly conserved
residues even with its closest relative COG2428 (which
was predicted as a family of putative MTases by Ginalski
et al. [18], without providing any hints as to the identity
of the active site). Our protein fold-recognition analysis of
COG2419 and COG2428 members confirmed their
membership in the SPOUT superfamily. However, targettemplate alignments returned by different fold-recognition methods varied greatly and therefore the structural
predictions and the resulting alignments with other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

SPOUT members are the least confident among all
sequences analyzed in this work. Thus, we would like to
propose COG2419 and COG2428 members as attractive
targets for structure determination by X-ray crystallography and for detailed analysis of the architecture of the
active site and the biochemical mechanism of action.
Proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis are predicted
novel SPOUT MTases
COG1756 is a novel addition to the SPOUT superfamily.
It groups together proteins from Archaea and Eukaryota.
It is represented by the Nep1p protein from S. cerevisiae,
which has been implicated in pre-rRNA processing and its
indirect role in methylation during ribosome biogenesis
was supposed [56]. Recently, genetic evidence have been
presented for the role of Nep1p in 18S rRNA binding and
an Rps19p assembly [57]. Interestingly, it was found that
Nep1p binds RNA sequences that share a six-nucleotide
consensus motif C/UUCAAC, including the sequence of
nucleotides 1553–1577 in the 18S rRNA. This region
encompasses two modified nucleosides: m7G1573 modified by the yet unknown enzyme and Gm1570 modified
by the fibrillarin complex guided by the C/D box snoRNA
snR57. The deletion of snR57 RNA and multicopy expression of the ribosomal 40S subunit protein Rps19p can
partially suppress the growth defect caused by the deletion
of Nep1p-encoding gene. Thus, it was suggested that
Nep1p binds to helix 47 of the 18S rRNA and possibly
supports the association of Rps19p to pre-ribosomal particles [57]. Direct involvement of Nep1p in methylation
of G1570 was considered unlikely, because deletion of
snR57 in yeast leads to a complete absence of the Gm1570
modification despite the presence of Nep1p. On the other
hand, Nep1p ortholog is present in Sulfolobus solfataricus,
which lacks m7G1573, thus arguing against the involvement of Nep1p also in G1573 modification [57].

The identification of the SPOUT domain in COG1756
suggests that Nep1p may be enzymatically active as an
AdoMet-dependent MTase, whose action can somehow
interfere with the snoRNA-guided methylation of G1570.
Analysis of sequence conservation in COG1756 reveals
invariant and early invariant residues in the structurally
variable N-terminus that cannot be modeled with confidence rather than in the structurally conserved knotted Cterminus. Therefore, the architecture of the potential
active site cannot be predicted with confidence and only a
number of potentially functionally important residues
can be proposed for experimental analysis: E51, R88,
D90, S102, R129. At this stage it is not possible to confidently predict the biochemical function of Nep1, however, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues
might discriminate between the catalytic and possible
non-catalytic roles of Nep1p in ribosome biogenesis (e.g.
'chaperoning' of the ribosome assembly by interacting

with RNA and ribosomal proteins) and reveal its molecular mechanism of action.
Structural and evolutionary classification of the SPOUT
superfamily
Based on the sequence alignment of the structurally conserved (and therefore reliably alignable) knot region of
SPOUT MTases (Figure 7) we attempted to infer the phylogenetic tree of the superfamily. However, traditional
methods for phylogenetic reconstruction based on
sequence data, including the neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML)
failed to produce a confident tree with well-resolved
branches. The NJ and MP methods failed apparently due
to the high sequence divergence and uneven rates of evolution between and within different lineages, while for the
ML tree the bootstrap support could not be calculated due
to prohibitively long computation time. Thus, we decided
to use the Bayesian approach, which combines the relative
reliability of ML with the fast scanning of the parameter
landscape by the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
approach implemented in the program MrBayes3 [58].
Figure 8 shows a Bayesian tree of SPOUT sequences,
which suggests that known ribose 2'-O-MTases together
with m3U MTases, to the exclusion of m1G MTases, while.
The branches, however, received low support, and the
topology was sensitive to the choice of parameters (e.g.
substitution matrices, models of substitution etc.)

Because protein structure is much more conserved than
protein sequence, it allows making evolutionary inferences through comparative structure analysis – either
without any consideration of sequence [59] or by combination of sequence and structure data. Initially, we
attempted to infer a tree for representative SPOUT structures using several methods for calculation of 'structural'
distances via the STRUCLA server [60]. However, the
resulting trees were even less robust than those based
solely on sequence and no meaningful consensus could
be derived (data not shown). Thus, we sought to determine the phylogenetic tree of the SPOUT superfamily
using an approach similar to the one recently used to
resolve relationships in the protein kinase-like superfamily [61], namely a unified Bayesian analysis that incorporates the sequence alignment and other features,
including structure data, discretized into 'characters'. This
approach often yields improved resolution of both close
relationships (owing to the criterion of sequence divergence, with nearly identical structures) and remote ones
(owing to the criterion of structural divergence, with
sequences diverged to the level of random noise). It is
noteworthy that in the case of the SPOUT superfamily this
approach allowed us to extend the quantitative comparison to sequence and structural features that span sequence
regions outside the common core corresponding to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

knotted region (Figure 7). The N-terminal part of the
SPOUT domain is extremely diverged and contains variable number of secondary structure elements, making this
region spatially non-superimposable for some members,
and virtually precluding the creation of a full-length alignment, in particular for those families, which lack structurally characterized representatives. Nonetheless, different
SPOUT subfamilies do exhibit clear pairwise similarities
or share various common features also in the N-terminal
region, and these data can be incorporated in the unified
Bayesian analysis along with the sequence alignment data
for the knotted C-terminal part.
We decided to complement the alignment data with several different types of characters, with their states given in
a numbered code (Table 2). In features 1–3 we considered
global structural similarity between the experimentally
determined structures, which is a very strong direct indicator of evolutionary relationship. In particular features 1
and 2 relied on comparison between the isolated, monomeric SPOUT catalytic domains using DALI [16] (see
Table 1). A particular 'state' was assigned to members of
clusters identified according to the single linkage criterion
with an arbitrary threshold of similarity. 'Singletons' were
considered as different states. The state of features 1–3
requires experimentally determined structures, they cannot be reliably assessed for proteins of unknown structure
(not even for comparative models), therefore for the
majority of COGs they remained unassigned for the Bayesian analysis and are indicated as '?' in Table 1. In features
4–5 we considered global sequence similarity, which has
the advantage of comparing all SPOUT families, regardless of the availability of structures. Moreover, as with the
structural comparisons by DALI, it permits comparing and
detecting similarity between the N-terminal segments.
The assignment of states for features 4 and 5 was done in
a similar way as for features 1 and 2. Feature 6 is the type
of the methylated nucleoside generated in the reaction:
obviously, for the functionally uncharacterized SPOUT
families the state of this feature is unassigned. Features 7–
11 identify conserved residues or structural peculiarities –
here 1 indicates that the character is present, while its
absence is regarded as an unassigned state '-' (the missing
feature is regarded identically as '?' i.e. variants with a particular feature are grouped together, but those without it
may or may not to be grouped together). Feature 12 concerns the presence or absence of a highly variable strand
in the N-terminal region, which can be determined from
the structures or inferred from secondary structure predictions. Here, 1 indicates that the character is present (the
N-terminal variable region comprises 3 strands), 0 that it
is absent (the N-terminal variable region comprises 2
strands), while for two families the state could not be
determined ('?') due to the absence of experimentally

The phylogenetic value of characters from Table 2 was
assessed by using them to calculate a Bayesian tree with-

out any reference to the sequence alignment. The tree
based on features (Figure 9) generally agrees with the tree
based solely on amino acid distances (Figure 8): in particular, two main branches are apparent, one with m1G
MTases and the other with known ribose 2'-O-MTases.

However, only a few well-supported branches can be considered as informative, e.g. the grouping of four COGS:
0248, 2419, 0336, and 1576, and the grouping of
COG1901 with COG1385. Other nodes of the featurebased tree are practically unresolved, including the entire
branch of 2'-O-MTases. Interestingly, the position of a few
'uncharacterized' COGs differs between the sequence- and
feature-based trees. In particular in the sequence-based
tree COG1901 is found in the m1G branch with a moderate support, while in the feature-based tree is groups
together with COG1385 (and in general with m3U and
ribose MTases) with a strong support. Overall, the featurebased tree has better resolution for deep nodes (remote
relationships) but does not distinguish between terminal
nodes, while the sequence-based tree has reasonable resolution for terminal nodes, but does not provide confident
estimation of remote relationships. Thus, both types of
data show high potential for complementation.
In order to meaningfully combine the alignment data
with the feature data, we decided to increase the importance of structural information. Since the feature data
comprise only 12 character types, we decided to
'strengthen' the feature data by multiplying the columns
with 'structural' characters (features 1–3) by two. The
resulting character matrix with 15 columns was incorporated into the input file to be quantitatively evaluated
together with sequences as 'mixed' data, allowing the creation of a single Bayesian tree that provides maximum
agreement with both sequences and features. The resulting tree (Figure 10) exhibits the most important features
exhibited both by the sequences-only tree and by the features-only tree, in particular the presence of a wellresolved division between Xm and m1G MTases, but now
both the deep and terminal nodes receive better support
than in any of the original trees and the mutual relationship of many families can be resolved with confidence.
Only the position of COG1901 is unresolved – the combination of sequence data for the knotted region pulling it
towards m1G MTases and the data on overall features pulling it towards COG1385 resulted in artificial placement of
COG1901 at the root. Moreover, the internal structure of
the 'supercluster' (COGs 0219, 0565, 0566) branch
remains unresolved (as It was both original trees), mostly
due to the abundance of highly conserved residues in the
aligned knotted region (e.g. paucity of informative sites
that would help to distinguish between subfamilies) and
virtual identity according to the structural and functional
features (nearly identical structures, very similar functions).
To obtain a meaningful tree for the closely related members of COGs 0219, 0565 and 0566 (A, B, and C) that
could not be separated in the SPOUT tree, we constructed
a multiple sequence alignment and calculated a Maxi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

mum Evolution tree (Figure 11, see Methods for details).
All five families form monophyletic branches, in agreement with the classification based on the results of CLANS
analyses. The monophyly of COG0219, COG0565, and
the whole COG0566 is strongly supported. The classification of COG0566 into three families receives relatively
low statistical support, indicating that divergence within
each subfamily is comparable to the divergence between
the subfamilies. Thus, duplications within COG0566
occurred probably shortly before the radiation of all
major bacterial lineages. However, COG0566B and
COG0566C group together to the exclusion of
COG0566A, in agreement with their predicted common
origin from one of the two first copies of the ancient
COG566 MTase that acquired a L30e-like domain.
Interpretation of the phylogenetic trees: origin and
evolution of the SPOUT superfamily
A major question in evolutionary analyses of protein
(super)families concerns the time of their origin and
appearance of the main lineages with respect to the Last
Universal Common Ancestor of all contemporary cellular
organisms (LUCA). For the SPOUT superfamily, this has
been subject to controversy. In the analysis of AdoMetbinding proteins reported by Mushegian, only the predecessor of COG0565 is thought to has been present in
LUCA [5]. On the other hand, Ouzounis and coworkers
predicted the members of both COG0566 and COG0565
to be present in LUCA; COG1385 and COG1576 were
hypothesized to be present in LUCA as well, but only
under a more relaxed model of gene loss [62]. However,
these inferences have not taken into account the possibility that some COGs with (partially) complementary phylogenetic distributions may be orthologous. Here, we
attempted to infer the evolutionary history of the whole
SPOUT superfamily and predict its state in LUCA by interpreting the tree in the light of the phyletic distribution of
different COGs (Figure 6).

Although a few SPOUT families possess members in all
three Domains of Life, Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota,
some of them might have expanded to the contemporary
phylogenetic range not by vertical descent, but by the horizontal gene transfer (HTG). In particular, the single
archaeal members of COGs that are almost exclusively
bacterio-eukaryotic (COG0566: one archaeal representative in Archaeoglobus fulgidus) or bacterial (COG1576: one
archaeal representative in Methanococcus maripaludis) have
been almost certainly acquired by HGT from Bacteria living in similar environments. Conversely, a few bacterial
members of a typically archaeal COG1901 could have
been acquired by HGT from Archaea. Bacterio-archaeal
COG0565 possesses a single eukaryotic member in Entamoeba histolytica, which was probably acquired by HGT
from a bacterium. In addition, several almost exclusively

bacterial COGs such as COG0219, COG1576, COG0336,
and COG1385 possess eukaryotic members only in
plants, which suggests that the latter have been acquired
by HGT from the chloroplast endosymbiont and the
respective families can be regarded as of bacterial origin.
The sparsely populated bacterial COG4752 could have
evolved by duplication and/or HGT from one of the bacterial families within the supercluster or from one the
archaeal COGs – 'satellites' of the supercluster (Figure 4).

Some COGs that appear as neighbors in the tree, exhibit
identical or very similar phyletic distribution, which suggests that they evolved by duplication from an ancestral
sequence that was characteristic for a given group of taxons. On the other hand, some closely related COGs
exhibit complementary phyletic distribution (typically:
Bacteria and Eukaryota+Archaea) and may be orthologous. This in turn suggests that the SPOUT superfamily
had multiple members in the LUCA, which gave rise to the

extant COGs only after the radiation of the three Domains
of Life. One example of a family that underwent multiple
duplications is offered by the 'supercluster', comprising
five families with members present in most Bacteria
(COG0219, COG0565, and three families of COG0566).
The most parsimonious explanation for the results of our
analyses is that this group of sequences had a single ancestor in LUCA (most likely the predecessor of extant
COG0565), which functioned as a ribose MTase. It was
duplicated in the bacterial lineage to yield ancestors of
COG0566 and COG0219, followed by further duplications of COG0566 to yield three extant families (the
duplication yielding COG566B and COG566C was probably the most recent, as these two COGs share a common
fusion with the L30e-like domain). It is likely that all these
descendants of the ancestral ribose MTase were transferred to the primordial Eukaryote via the mitochondrial
endosymbiont, where virtually all representatives of
COG0219 and COG0565 were lost (a single COG0565
member in E. histolytica has been most likely reintroduced
by HGT from Bacteria), while members of COG0566 were
transferred to the nuclear genome and adapted to function in different compartments as well as acquired new

functions (e.g. Mrm1p and Trm3p, see above). In parallel,
multiple duplications within the archaeal lineage or horizontal transfers from thermophilic Bacteria gave rise to
archaeal COGs: 4080, 1818, 1303, and 1772. Alternative
scenarios, in which duplications of the ancestral ribose
MTase precede LUCA, cannot be completely ruled out, but
are in our opinion unlikely. Thus, we predict that all currently known 2'-O-ribose MTases and their homologs
identified in this work can be traced to just one ancestor
in LUCA.
Another apparently monophyletic pair of families with
complementary phyletic distributions is formed by bacterial COG1385 (16S rRNA:m3U1498 MTase RsmE) and
archaeo-eukaryotic COG2106 (uncharacterized proteins).
It is noteworthy that the PUA domain N-terminally fused
to the SPOUT domain in COG1385 and the domain
inserted into the SPOUT domain in COG2106 both
exhibit the same OB-fold, and that they assume a similar
spatial orientation with respect to the catalytic domain
despite completely different connectivity at the sequence

COG2106 has been derived from the tandem domain

A speculative scenario of the evolutionary history of the SPOUT superfamily. This scenario is based on the assumption that Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota are all monophyletic, that Archaea and Eukaryota are sister lineages, and that the
root (corresponding to the LUCA) is located in the branch between Bacteria and the Last Common Ancestor of Eukaryota
and Archaea (LCAEA). Three major branches corresponding to the three Domains of Life. Lines in different colors indicate
COGs (blue: 2'-O-ribose methylation, red: m1G methylation, green: m3U methylation, grey – unknown). Crosses indicate
extinction. Dotted arrows indicate putative horizontal gene transfers. Dashed ellipses indicate uncertainty in the assignment of
genes that underwent duplication to yield a particular COG, e.g. they encompass sets of potential mother lineages.

Figure origins of the knot
Possible 13
Possible origins of the knot. A) Contemporary knotted SPOUT fold, exemplified by E. coli YbeA (1ns5). B) Putative ancestral structure, 'unknotted' by deletion of an α/β unit. C) Alternative putative ancestral structure, 'unknotted' by circular permutation, i.e. linking 'old' termini and cutting the knot to create new termini. Protein sequence is colored from blue (N-terminus)
to red (C-terminus).

fusion exhibited by COG1385. The insertion could have
been generated in the course of illegitimate recombination, and selected owing to the increased rigidity of the
putative RNA-binding OB-fold domain attached to the
SPOUT domain by two linkers on both sides. Thus, we
predict that COG1385 and COG2106 are orthologous
and that their common ancestor was present in LUCA.
Since Eukaryota generally lack m3U in their SSU rRNA,
members of COG2106 could be involved in methylation
at a different position than the target of their predicted
bacterial orthologs.
The branch comprising m1G MTases includes COGs with
nearly perfectly complementary phyletic distribution:
either exclusively bacterial (with members in plants most
likely derived from the bacterial endosymbionts) or exclusively archaeo-eukaryotic. The close relationship between
COG2419 and COG2428 suggests that they are paralogs.
The exact time of their origin is unclear, as COG2419 is
present in nearly all Eukaryota and Archaea, while the
presence of COG2428 is restricted to Archaea, fungi, and
Plasmodium, suggesting either ancient duplication followed by loss of most members of COG2428 or (in our
opinion less likely) a more recent duplication either in
Archaea or fungi, followed by GHT to the other lineage
(fungi or Archaea, respectively), and to Plasmodium.
The close association between the archaeo-eukaryotic lineage COG2419/COG2428 (tRNAm1G9 MTase Trm10)
and bacterial COG0336 (tRNA:m1G38 MTase TrmD) sug-

gests that they are orthologous branches of an ancient
m1G MTase family that has been present in LUCA. The
ancestral function of members of the entire TrmD/Trm10
clade could have been the N1-methylation of G37 in the
anticodon loop, which has been maintained in the very
strongly conserved TrmD family (the average sequence
identity is higher in COG0336 than in any other SPOUT
family). The strong divergence of the COG2419/
COG2428 branch could have been caused by the lost
competition with Trm5p MTases (members of the RFM
superfamily) that functionally replaced TrmD in Archaea
and Eukaryota and apparently forced the 'defeated'
orthologs of TrmD to migrate into new evolutionary
niches that are not occupied in Bacteria, such as such as
N1-methylation of G9 in tRNA. COG2419 has been
expanded by several duplications in metazoans [52], and
its new members have been probably adapted to methylate different substrates (possibly different tRNAs).
The 'm1G branch' contains also the bacterial COG1576
(uncharacterized protein YbeA) and archaeo-eukaryotic
COG1756, whose relationships to each other and to m1G
MTases are however unclear. They could either represent
another orthologous lineage, whose duplication from the
ancestor of m1G MTases predated LUCA, or products of
more recent, independent duplications of predecessors of
the two m1G COGs. Duplications predating LUCA followed by lineage-specific loss also cannot be ruled out,
however we find them unlikely. Thus, we postulate the
most parsimonious scenario, that m1G MTases and their

Page 24 of 31

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:73

homologs evolved from one common ancestor present in
or before LUCA. Because of the 'minimal' character of
COG1576 both with respect to the number of secondary
structures in a protomer and the relatively small dimerization interface, we predict that the Ur-SPOUT protein was
structurally similar to YbeA and its relatives.
As mentioned earlier, the relationship of archaeal
COG1901 to other families is uncertain. In different analyses it groups together either with m3U or m1G MTases.
However, it does not share the active site with either of
these families. We predict it is a product of Archaea-specific duplication, either of COG2106 or one of the m1Glineage families or a derivative of COG1385 horizontally
transferred to the ancestor of Archaea from a bacterium.
Members of COG1901 may catalyze the formation of
Archaea-specific methylation, for instance m1Ψ formation, or another modification conserved in most Archaea.
Experimental analysis of the bacterial member from Vibrio
vulgaris (product of an ORF VV21434) may help to resolve
this issue.
Summarizing, we predict that LUCA contained at least
three SPOUT members, involved in ribose 2'-O-methylaton, guanosine N1-methylation, and uridine N3-methylation (or a similar reaction, such as methylation of
endocyclic nitrogen atoms in another base). Our speculative scenario of the evolutionary history of the SPOUT
superfamily is illustrated in Figure 12.
Before the LUCA: Speculations on the possible origin of
the α/β knot in the SPOUT superfamily
The SPOUT superfamily is unique in that all its characterized members possess a very deep knot. The only exception is TrmD from A. aeolicus, in whose structure (1oy5)
no knot has been observed [63]. However, comparison
with very closely related, independently determined and
published about the same time structures of TrmD from
H. influenzae (1uak) [10] and E. coli (1p9p) [11] reveal
that its lack of the knot may be an artifact of crystallographic data interpretation. The 'unknotted' loop in 1oy5
blocks the AdoMet-binding site, which suggests that it was
probably misthreaded into the electron density of the
cofactor (data not shown). Amino acid residues involved
in stabilization of the knot are conserved in the TrmD
family, therefore we believe that the true structure of A.
aeolicus TrmD is knotted as well.

Despite the conservation of the knot among SPOUT
superfamily members, virtually nothing is known about
its origin, both in the time scale of evolution, when the
SPOUT ancestor appeared, and in the time scale of protein
folding. Experimental analysis of the YibK protein
revealed that it can be denatured reversibly, and that it
folds via two parallel pathways partitioned by proline

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

isomerization events, to two distinct monomeric intermediates with native-like secondary and tertiary structure
[64,65]. However, the mechanism of formation of the
knot itself has not been analyzed. The analysis of protein
dynamics to identify potential folding pathways of
SPOUT proteins is beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that the presence of
fusions of SPOUT domains with other large domains at
both termini, and in particular tandem fusions of SPOUT
domains within the same polypeptide identified in this
work (Figure 3), suggests that either the knotting must
involve very large loops, through which the whole
domains are threaded, or that knot formation may occur
in either direction, i.e. by threading of either N- or C-terminal regions. The detailed analysis of the SPOUT folding
pathways must however await additional experimental
data.
Virnau and co-workers have recently examined the occurrence and conservation of knots in structures in the Protein Data Bank [66]. Apart from the already known
SPOUT MTases with a conserved knot, they found a pair
of proteins from a different superfamily, for which topology is not preserved. N-acetylornithine transcarbamylase
(AOTCase) contains a deep trefoil knot similar to that in
SPOUT MTases (a C-terminal α-helix threaded through a
loop connecting a β-strand with another α-helix) [67],
while its close homolog L-ornithine transcarbamylase
(OTCase) is unknotted [68]. Despite the different topology, both structures have the same fold, and their backbone coordinates are nearly identical and differ mainly in
the length of the loop that forms the knot. The most parsimonious explanation is that a short insertion enlarged
the loop, thus allowing for threading the C-terminal helix
through that loop before the rest of the protein is fully
folded [66]. That simple mechanism suggests an analogous scenario for the origin of the deep knot in the SPOUT
superfamily. We hypothesize that a region preceding the
knotted C-terminal helix, including the AdoMet-binding
loop, a β-strand, and the 2ndα-helix from the C-terminus,
originated from an insertion in the ancestral Rossmanoidal fold, comprising originally probably only 4 β-strands
and 3 α-helices (Figure 13). The insertion was longer than
in AOTCase, and formed not just a loop, but a new αβ segment that extended the core sheet, as frequently happens
in the evolution of α/β proteins [69-71]. Hydrogen-bonding of the new strand to the β-sheet forced the C-terminal
helix to pass below the arch formed by the loop at the new
edge of the β-sheet, thereby forming the knot. A part of the
insertion formed a new loop that in extant SPOUT MTases
serves as a cofactor-binding site. Binding of the cofactor
might have provided stability to the rearranged structure,
as well as a new function (methylation). The creation of
the knot and/or the cofactor binding site probably
required secondary adaptive mutation which stabilized

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:73

the unique structure of the ancestral SPOUT fold. Some of
these adaptations could have involved dimerization and/
or RNA binding, although it cannot be excluded that these
features were already present in the ancestral unknotted
protein. Regrettably, we could not detect any known protein structures with the same fold as our hypothetical preSPOUT Rossmanoid. Therefore, we cannot propose any
detailed hypothesis about its function or relationship to
the known folds, besides the very general similarity to
Rossmanoidal proteins that often bind nucleosides.
An alternative mechanism for the knot formation in the
SPOUT fold involves an un-knotted ancestor with a similar number and spatial orientation of secondary structure
elements to those present in the extant SPOUT MTases,
albeit with a circularly permuted order of these elements.
Circular permutations have been reported in various DNA
and RNA MTases from the RFM superfamily [72-74]. It
has been speculated that permutation could have played
a role in the evolution of new specificities and appearance
of dimerization in DNA MTases [75,76]. In the SPOUT
domain the N- and C-termini are adjacent in space, suggesting that the C-terminal helix could be covalently
linked to the N-terminal strand without the need of a long
linker. However, the introduction of new termini in the
place of the knot would lead to the interruption and possibly destabilization of the AdoMet-binding loop. Thus,
circular permutation from an unknotted ancestor with the
AdoMet-binding site formed by flexible termini could
have been selected for the improved cofactor binding and
catalytic efficiency.
The aforementioned hypothetical scenarios for the origin
of the SPOUT fold can be tested experimentally, e.g. by
reconstruction of the putative insertion-less and circularly
un-permuted ancestral SPOUT structures and studies of
their stability, ability to form dimers, ability to bind
AdoMet and/or RNA, and the enzymatic activity. The
comparative analysis of the SPOUT superfamily presented
in this work will help selecting optimal targets for such
experiments and will aid in understanding of the determinants for formation, stability and function of the knots.

Discussion
The availability of the complete catalog of RNA MTases
and understanding the mechanism of their action on the
biochemical and cellular level is an essential stepping
stone for the complete understanding of mechanisms that
govern posttranscriptional modification and maturation
of RNA. Thus far, only a fraction of known methylations
sites in RNA has been linked to known protein families.
Among several superfamilies of MTases, whose substrates
include RNA, SPOUT enzymes are unique in that none of
them has been ever found to act on any other substrate
than RNA. This preference for one type of macromolecu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

lar substrate makes the newly discovered members of the
SPOUT superfamily very attractive candidates for functional analyses. However, since the pioneering analysis of
Anantharaman, Koonin, and Aravind, who identified
homology between SpoU and TrmD MTases and defined
the SPOUT superfamily [1], no comprehensive comparative analysis of these proteins has been published. Since
then, many crystal structures of SPOUT-fold proteins have
been solved and numerous new sequences appeared in
the databases. Many of the structures were solved by structural genomics centers, which provide little, if any functional information (Table 2).
Motivated by the availability of numerous poorly annotated structures and sequences of apparent SPOUT
homologs and the lack of a good 'road map' to navigate
between them, we carried out extensive bioinformatics
analyses aimed at comprehensive classification of the
SPOUT superfamily and making functional predictions
for the emerging (sub)families of uncharacterized proteins. Our results revealed new members of previously
identified SPOUT families, and suggested that several previously identified, but structurally uncharacterized protein families also belong to the SPOUT superfamily. In
particular, we predict that the COG4080 family annotated
as RecB nuclease homologs should be reclassified as putative MTases, and that the COG1756 family of proteins
implicated in rRNA maturation and indirectly related to
methylation may be catalytically active as MTases. It must
be mentioned, however, that MTase homologs may
exhibit non-MTase functions. There is a number of MTaselike members of the RFM superfamily, which bind
AdoMet (or similar cofactors), but catalyze different reactions, such as methylene transfer, condensation of
AdoMet, transfer of the aminopropyl groups, or hydroxylation. Moreover, a number of RFM proteins have been
reported to be enzymatically inactive, but involved in
other activities e.g. nucleic acid binding (review: [5]). So
far, this phenomenon has not been reported for SPOUT
MTases, but in principle it cannot be excluded that some
of the uncharacterized SPOUTs analyzed in this article
carry out different reactions than methylation (with or
without AdoMet) or are enzymatically inactive. As mentioned in the Results, one candidate for an inactive, regulatory or substrate-binding subunit of a heterodimeric
complex is the Ymr310cp protein, a close paralogs of
Ygr283cp (COG 2106).

Conclusion
We delineated the common core of SPOUT MTases and
inferred a multiple sequence alignment for the conserved
knot region, from which we calculated the phylogenetic
tree of the superfamily. We also analyzed the phylogenetic
distribution of different families, and used this information to infer the evolutionary history of the SPOUT super-

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:73

family and the number of ancient SPOUT enzymes in
LUCA. We also proposed tentative scenarios for the origin
of the deep knot in the SPOUT fold. In parallel, we correlated the presence of SPOUT members with the presence
of known RNA modifications in E. coli for which no
enzymes have been assigned yet. Based on the conservation of the putative active sites, we predicted biochemical
functions for some of the so far uncharacterized families.
These predictions will guide experimental analyses aiming
at better understanding sequence-structure-function relationships in the SPOUT superfamily, as well as completing the picture of RNA modification pathways. Detailed
characterization of all SPOUT MTases from model organisms may be the first important step towards this goal.

Methods
Sequence database searches, multiple alignments and
comparison of sequence-structure profile HMMs
Representative members of previously identified families
within the SPOUT superfamily (TrmH (SpoU),
GI:48425869; RlmB (YjfH), GI:24987276; YsgA,
GI:22218790; LasT, GI:12516936; YibK, GI:466744;

GI:11499808; Trm10, GI:39584992; RsmE, GI:18313154;
YbeA, GI:28374103; PF1588, GI:18977960) were used as
seeds in PSI-BLAST [77] searches of the non-redundant
(nr) version of current sequence databases (nr) and the
publicly available complete and incomplete genome
sequences with the expectation (e) value threshold for the
retrieval of related sequences set to 10-3. All retrieved
sequences were subsequently realigned using MUSCLE
[28,78] to the degapped profiles obtained from the multiple sequence alignments reported by BLAST. Additional
sequence alignments were done with MUMMALS [79].
Incomplete sequences were discarded (if the deletion
spanned > 30% of the alignment) or repaired using amino
acid sequences predicted from the available DNA
sequences of the corresponding genes. Manual adjustments were introduced into the alignments to preserve the
continuity of secondary structure elements, either
observed in crystal structures or predicted computationally (see below). The alignments were used to generate a
set of query profile-HMMs using HHmake from the
HHsearch package [25] and searched against the profileHHMs corresponding to alignments of protein families
obtained from the COG, KOG [80], and PFAM [81] databases. The comparison of the profile HMMs (including
protein sequences and consensus secondary structure)
was carried out using HHsearch [25], with default parameters. Results of the most recent CASP7 competition
(announced while this article was under review) demonstrated an outstanding performance of HHsearch (as a
HHpred server) in remote protein homology detection,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

which validates our choice of this method as the primary
tool for the analysis of the SPOUT superfamily.
Sequence clustering
To identify (sub)families of closely related sequences and
visualize similarities within and between all SPOUT
members we used CLANS (CLuster ANalysis of
Sequences), a Java utility that applies version of the Fruchterman-Reingold graph layout algorithm [27]. CLANS
uses the P-values of high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs)
obtained from an N × N BLAST search, to compute attractive and repulsive forces between each sequence pair in a
user-defined dataset. A 3D or 2D representation is
achieved by randomly seeding sequences in the arbitrary
distance space. The sequences are then moved within this
environment according to the force vectors resulting from
all pairwise interactions and the process is repeated to
convergence.
Structural alignment of SPOUT families
The representative SPOUT structures (Table 1) were first
superimposed using SwissPDBViewer [82]. The automatically generated sequence alignment based on this superposition was carefully analyzed and verified manually, to
identify all homologous positions and maximize the
number of aligned residues between as many structures as
possible, provided that there was a rational basis for the
alignment. At all times, the alignment was guided by
direct visual inspection of the structures. The resulting
high-quality alignment was used as a starting point to add
computationally modeled structures for those families,
which lacked experimental structural information. In a
few cases, the confrontation of the multiple structure
alignment has lead to slight revisions of the model (e.g.
rebuilding it with small residue shifts). Because of significant structural divergence of the N-terminal Rossmanoidal part of the SPOUT fold and the uncertainty of many
models in this region, we decided to retain only the knotted part of the structure, comprising four strands and two
helices. As a result, we obtained a high-quality multiple
sequence alignment of a structurally conserved region
common to all SPOUT proteins, comprising at least one
representative from each family analyzed in this work.
Subsequently, we 'extended' this alignment by adding
more members for each family, based on sequence alignments constructed independently for each family. We
believe this alignment is of sufficient quality to serve as a
'gold standard' for studying the SPOUT superfamily.
Phylogenetic analyses
MrBayes MPI version 3.1.2 [58] was used to carry out a
Bayesian analysis of data. A combined analysis was preformed using both the sequence alignment for family representatives (only the confidently aligned knotted region)
and features as defined in Table 2. Features were encoded

Page 27 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:73

as standard unordered characters. The sequence dataset
was modeled with a gamma distribution of substitution
rates, using the default approximation of four rate classes
for each. Preliminary runs with MrBayes using a mixture
of model priors demonstrated conclusively that priors
based on the substitution rates from the BLOSUM matrices [83] provided best fit to the sequence data. Therefore,
the BLOSUM model was used to provide substitution priors for the sequence partition of the data. A Metropoliscoupled Markov-chain Monte-Carlo analysis was preformed with 2.000.000 generations, two runs and eight
chains (four per run). The Markov chain was sampled
every 100 generations. Convergence of runs was confirmed by average standard split deviation factor that falls
under the recommended value of 0.01. The final tree was
obtained after removing the first 25% of samples. Analogous calculations were carried out for the sequence alignment and the feature matrix alone. These runs used
identical parameter settings to those for the mixed model
for the corresponding datasets.
The phylogenetic tree for the supercluster was inferred for
200 representative members of COGs 0219, 0565, and
566, using the alignment of a complete catalytic domain
(not only the knotted part, but also the Rossmanoidal Nterminus). Representative members were selected from all
members of the supercluster using the 'purge' option of
the Gibbs sampler [84], with the BLOSUM62 score of 300
as a threshold for maximal sequence similarity to include
any two sequences in the output file. A Minimum Evolution analysis carried out with MEGA 3.1 [85] (with pairwise gaps deletion and either Dayhoff or JTT matrices) was
sufficient to infer a tree with pre-defined subfamilies
grouped into monophyletic branches, thus the Bayesian
analysis was not attempted. Since the bootstrap test tends
to become progressively more conservative as the number
of sequences in the tree increases, we assessed the stability
of the tree using the interior branch test [86], which is
believed to have virtually the same statistical properties as
the bootstrap test irrespective of the number of sequences
used.
Protein structure prediction
Secondary structure prediction and tertiary fold-recognition was carried out via the GeneSilico meta-server gateway [26]. Secondary structure was predicted using a
consensus of PSIPRED [87], PROFsec [88], PROF [89],
SABLE [90], JNET [91], JUFO [92], PORTER [93], SSPRO2
[94] and SAM-T02 [95]. Solvent accessibility for the individual residues was predicted with SABLE [90], ACCPRO2
[94], and JNET [91]. The fold-recognition (FR) analysis
(attempt to match the query sequence to known protein
structures) was carried out using PDBBLAST (local implementation of a PSI-BLAST [77] search against sequences of
proteins from the PDB), HHSEARCH [25], FFAS03 [96],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/73

FORTE [97], SAM-T02 [95], 3DPSSM [98], INBGU [99],
FUGUE [100], mGENTHREADER [101], and SPARKS
[102]. Target-template alignments reported by these
methods were compared, evaluated, and ranked by the
PCONS server [103] to identify the preferred modeling
templates and the consensus alignment.
Homology modeling and model assessment
The alignments between the sequences of the selected representatives of all COGs of unknown structures and the
structures of selected templates identified by Pcons were
used as a starting point for modeling of the members of:
COG0565, COG4752, COG1303, COG1818, COG1772,
COG4080, COG1901, COG2419, COG2428 and
COG1756 tertiary structure using the "FRankenstein's
Monster" approach [104,105], comprising cycles of
model building, evaluation, realignment in poorly scored
regions and merging of best scoring fragments. The positions of predicted catalytic residues and secondary structure elements were used as spatial restraints. This
methodology was described in great detail in a number of
our previous papers on MTases and other enzymes, the
readers are encouraged to check out the recent articles
describing the modeling of RNA MTases TrmJ [30] and
HEN1 [106]. The 'FRankenstein's monster' approach was
objectively found as one of the most accurate methods for
template-based modeling of protein structures in the
rankings of CASP5 and CASP6 [107,108]. For the evaluation of models we used PROQ [109,110], and a MetaMQAP method recently developed in our group [111],
which allow predicting the deviation of individual residues in the model from their counterparts in the native
structure. Models were evaluated and corrected if certain
regions were not modeled confidently (e.g. we were not
certain of the alignment), and exhibited poor PROQ or
MetaMQAP scores.

In this analysis, modeling had only a supporting role for
the generation of high-quality alignments, and regions
that could not be modeled reliably were left 'unfinished'.
Therefore, the models of individual proteins are not
shown. They can be, however, obtained from the corresponding author (J.M.B.) upon request.
