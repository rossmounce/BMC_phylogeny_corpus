An intein with genetically selectable markers
provides a new approach to internally label
proteins with GFP
Richard Ramsden, Luther Arms, Trisha N Davis and Eric GD Muller*

Abstract
Background: Inteins are proteins that catalyze their own removal from within larger precursor proteins. In the
process they splice the flanking protein sequences, termed the N-and C-terminal exteins. Large inteins frequently
have a homing endonuclease that is involved in maintaining the intein in the host. Splicing and nuclease activity
are independent and distinct domains in the folded structure. We show here that other biochemical activities can
be incorporated into an intein in place of the endonuclease without affecting splicing and that these activities can
provide genetic selection for the intein. We have coupled such a genetically marked intein with GFP as the Nterminal extein to create a cassette to introduce GFP within the interior of a targeted protein.
Results: The Pch PRP8 mini-intein of Penicillium chrysogenum was modified to include: 1) aminoglycoside
phosphotransferase; 2) imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase, His5 from S. pombe ; 3) hygromycin B
phosphotransferase; and 4) the transcriptional activator LexA-VP16. The proteins were inserted at the site of the lost
endonuclease. When expressed in E. coli, all of the modified inteins spliced at high efficiency. Splicing efficiency
was also greater than 96% when expressed from a plasmid in S. cerevisiae. In addition the inteins conferred either
G418 or hygromycin resistance, or histidine or leucine prototropy, depending on the inserted marker and the yeast
genetic background. DNA encoding the marked inteins coupled to GFP as the N-terminal extein was PCR amplified
with ends homologous to an internal site in the yeast calmodulin gene CMD1. The DNA was transformed into
yeast and integrants obtained by direct selection for the intein’s marker. The His5-marked intein yielded a fully
functional calmodulin that was tagged with GFP within its central linker.
Conclusions: Inteins continue to show their flexibility as tools in molecular biology. The Pch PRP8 intein can
successfully tolerate a variety of genetic markers and still retain high splicing efficiency. We have shown that a
genetically marked intein can be used to insert GFP in one-step within a target protein in vivo.

Background
Inteins are small proteins naturally found either
embedded within a larger precursor protein (cis-acting
inteins), or split between two pro-proteins (trans-acting
inteins). They have the unique ability to self-catalyze
their excision from the pro-protein(s) and in the process
form a peptide bond between the flanking amino acid
sequences that reside at the N-and C-terminal boundaries with the intein [1,2]. These flanking regions adjacent to the intein are referred to as exteins, analogous
to the terminology for introns and exons. An intein acts

autonomously, splicing together the exteins without the
need of a co-factor or an assisting complex. Since splicing is post-translational, for cis-acting inteins a single
open reading frame driven by a single promoter
expresses two distinct mature protein products: the
spliced exteins and the intein.
The first intein described, Sce VMA1, was found in a
subunit of the vacuolar H + -adenosine triphosphatase
complex of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[3,4]. Currently over 500 inteins are known, found in
over 200 species of microorganisms in over 70 different
proteins [5]. Present in all three phylogenetic domains
of life, inteins in Eukaryotes are predominantly found in
fungi and unicellular alga [5].

A homing endonuclease is often present within
cis-acting inteins. The splicing and endonuclease
domains are structurally and functionally distinct, as
shown both by the crystal structure of Sce VMA1 [6]
and the conservation of splicing following the deletion
of the homing endonuclease [1,7]. In addition minimal
or mini-inteins lacking the homing endonuclease occur
naturally or have been engineered to be as small as 143
amino acids [8,9].
The use of inteins in molecular biology, biotechnology
and drug discovery has recently been reviewed [10-12].
The broad spectrum of applications for inteins is in part
due to the minimal constraints placed on the sequence
of the exteins. The only absolute requirement is the presence of cysteine, serine or threonine at the downstream
splice junction in the C-terminal extein. There are no
known size constraints. Splicing efficiency is reduced if
the extein domains are unfolded or have poor solubility,
but in vitro even this can usually be overcome with
detergents or refolding regimes [13]. The immediate
flanking sequence of the intein can affect splicing efficiency to varying degrees [14], but a variety of sequences
are tolerated. Thus the inherent tolerance of inteins
allows them to be adapted to splice proteins of diverse
character.
In this study the flexibility of inteins has been
exploited to investigate the potential for inteins to direct
in vivo gene modification, specifically the tagging of an
internal region of a protein with GFP. The microscopy
group of the Yeast Resource Center is focused on using
Förster resonance energy transfer, FRET, to study the
organization of large protein complexes in vivo [15-18].
A limiting step for FRET studies is identifying regions
within proteins that can accept a GFP-related fluorescent protein tag. As a first step towards overcoming this
limitation, we engineered genetic markers within the
Pch PRP8 intein that provided a way to internally tag
proteins in one step in yeast. The Pch PRP8 intein was
chosen for its robust, temperature-independent splicing
activity [9,19] and the engineered inteins continued to
display very high splicing efficiency.

independent proteins, when expressed in E. coli, had
active trans-splicing activity [20].
Given the tolerance of the “E” position for change, this
site in the Pch PRP8 intein was chosen for the insertion
of genes encoding genetically selectable enzymes. These
enzymes were: 1) aminoglycoside phosphotransferase; 2)
imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase from S. pombe;
and 3) hygromycin B phosphotransferase. They confer
G418/kanamycin resistance, histidine prototrophy and
hygromycin resistance in the appropriate yeast genetic
background, respectively. In addition the gene encoding
the transcriptional activator LexA-VP16 [21] was
inserted. These proteins share in common a modest size
(216, 269, 280 and 341 amino acids for His5, G418 R ,
LexA-VP16 and HygR, respectively) all below the typical
size of homing endonucleases (350-450 aa). Perhaps
more importantly the N-and C-terminal ends of each
protein are proximal to each other [22-25]. A schematic
diagram of these constructs is shown in Figure 1.
We used the experimental system of Elleuche et al.
[19] to test whether the Pch PRP8 intein with inserted
markers could splice. In their system GST is the
N-terminal extein and a 6 × His-tag is the C-terminal
extein. The embedded intein is expressed in E. coli and
splicing results in the production of GST-6 × His and
the released intein.
We confirmed the robust splicing activity of Pch PRP8
intein (Figure 2, lane 2). GST-6 × His and the released
intein are clearly visible in SDS-PAGE, and the identity
of spliced GST-6 × His was confirmed by Western blot
analysis with anti-6 × His and anti-GST antibodies. The
addition of cloning sites flanked by flexible protein
linkers at position E did not impair splicing since the
free inteins and the GST-6 × His were clearly visible in
SDS-PAGE with no evidence of unspliced products
(Figure 2, lane 3).
The modified inteins with the 4 different selection
marker cassettes also showed highly efficient splicing

During the course of their initial characterization of the

sequence of the intein with PRP8 inteins from other
species. The position of a presumptive lost homing
endonuclease was identified from a gap in the
alignment. This position, designated “E”, later was
shown to tolerate a deletion of six amino acids without
loss of splicing activity [9]. In addition the intein could
be split in half at this position and the resulting two

Figure 2 The marked Pch PRP8 inteins splice at high efficiency when expressed in E. coli. SDS-PAGE and Western blots of whole cell
lysates of E. coli carrying plasmids expressing the modified inteins. The N-and C-terminal exteins are GST (29 kD) and 6 × His (3 kD), respectively.
The markers inserted within the intein are indicated above each lane in the gel. Plasmid pGPch-1 is the starting vector with an unmodified Pch
PRP8 intein, and CS-linker refers to pGPch-1 with a cloning site and linkers. The predicted molecular weights (kDa) of the inteins are: Pch PRP8
(18), Pch PRP8-cloning site + linker (19); Pch PRP8-G418R (49); Pch PRP8-His5 (42); Pch PRP8-HygBR (57); Pch PRP8-LexA-VP16 (51). Pch PRP8-LexAVP16 migrates anomalously. GST-6 × His is ~30 kD. Expression of the inteins was driven by a tac promoter and was induced in lanes 2-7 with 0.2
mM IPTG. Western blot analysis was performed as described in Methods. The strong band at ~30 kD is the spliced extein, GST-6 × His. Plasmids
in the host E. coli strain: Lanes 1 and 2, pGPch-1; Lane 3, pRR01; Lane 4, pRR02; Lane 5, pRR03; Lane 6, pRR04; Lane 7, pRR05.

(Figure 2, lanes 4-7). Based on the ratio of spliced products to larger, unspliced proteins in the Western blots,
the splicing efficiencies ranged from ~88% for the Pch
PRP8 Hyg R -intein to almost 100% for the His5-and
LexA-VP16-inteins. Thus the Pch PRP8 intein tolerated
the insertion of four different proteins at the vacant
endonuclease site, maintaining nearly complete excision
and splicing activity in this system.
The marked Pch PRP8 inteins splice in yeast and confer
selectable genetic traits

To determine whether the modified inteins would
function in yeast we constructed a new panel of yeast
CEN4/URA3 plasmids that contained the marked
inteins expressed under the control of the GAL1
promoter. For these plasmids the N-terminal extein

was GFP containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS)
and the C-terminal extein was the FLAG peptide,
DYKDDDDK. Just as in the previous E. coli plasmids,
the extein/intein junction encodes five N-and four
C-terminal extein residues of the P. chrysogenum Prp8
protein. The spliced product is NLS-GFP-FLAG (33
kD) and the released intein carries the selectable
genetic marker or a transcription factor. NLS-GFP provided a simple way to follow expression and proper
folding of the extein.
In agreement with the results in E. coli, all of the
modified inteins when expressed in yeast displayed high
efficiency splicing (Figure 3). Based on the limits of
detection in the anti-GFP Westerns, we estimate that
the efficiency of splicing is greater than 96% for the
modified inteins.

Figure 3 Marked Pch PRP8 inteins splice and allow genetic selection in yeast. The inteins described in Figure 2, but with different exteins,
were expressed in yeast under the control of the GAL1 promoter. For expression in yeast, the N-extein was GFP with a nuclear localization
signal, and the C-extein was a FLAG epitope tag. The spliced extein product is NLS-GFP-FLAG (33 kD). The molecular weights of the Pch markerinteins are given in Figure 2. However in the anti-GFP and anti-FLAG Westerns there is no clear evidence for unspliced or partially spliced
products of higher molecular weight than the spliced product, such as seen in Figure 2. A. Western blots showing the high efficiency of splicing

Lane 4, pRR22; Lane 5, pRR23; Lane 6, pRR24; Lane 7, pRR25. Analysis was performed as described in Methods. The genetic markers of the inteins

band was apparent in all lanes, including the protein extracts from the vector alone and NLS-GFP expression in lanes 1 and 2. B. Five-fold serial
dilutions of the various yeast strains were prepared and spotted onto SGal-ura medium, SGal-ura medium lacking histidine or leucine, or SGal-ura

Concomitant with splicing the intein is released from
the precursor protein. The inteins did not inhibit growth
and provided resistance to G418 or hygromycin in cells
expressing the Pch PRP8 G418R -intein or the HygB Rintein, respectively (Figure 3B). Likewise the Pch PRP8
His5-intein was able to complement the mutation in
HIS3 in this genetic background (Figure 3B). Finally the
Pch PRP8 LexA-VP16-intein was able to drive expression of a LEU2 gene that had 2 lexA operator sequences
within its promoter and confer selectable leucine prototrophy to the yeast strain. Thus in all cases each marker
remained functional within the context of the excised
intein.
Direct integration of the marked inteins at the CMD1
locus

Having established that the intein remained active and
the embedded markers functional in yeast, we next
examined whether the marked inteins could provide a
method to introduce GFP within the coding sequence of
a targeted gene. For our test we chose CMD1, the gene
encoding yeast calmodulin [26]. Calmodulin contains
two globular EF-hand calcium-binding domains separated by a flexible linker. The design of the experiment
is presented in Figure 4. Briefly the GFP-Pch PRP8 marker-intein cassette was PCR amplified using oligonucleotide primers with ends homologous to the center of the

In the bottom panel are the two proteins produced after splicing: 1)
calmodulin with GFP inserted between S79 and N80, and 2) Pch
PRP8 intein with genetic markers inserted at the vacant
endonuclease site. The junction between L2 and L5 is the splice
site. L2 and L5 contain 5 and 4 amino acids from the original Pch
Prp8 extein sequences. For a description of the linker sequences see
Methods. EF refers to the calcium-binding EF-hand domains. The
sizes of the regions are drawn for clarity and are not to scale.

CMD1 gene encoding the central linker region. Transformation and direct selection for the markers within
the inteins isolates cells in which the Pch PRP8 GFPintein cassettes were inserted by homologous recombination between amino acids 79 and 80 of calmodulin.
Transformation with DNA from the Pch PRP8 G418R, His5-and HygBR-inteins produced transformants with
the selected auxotrophic or antibiotic resistance, while
the Pch PRP8 LexA-VP16-intein did not yield transformants. Since the level of expression of the intein is
dependent on the level of CMD1 expression we conclude that the LexA-VP16 was not at a level to fully
activate lexAop6-LEU2 gene expression in strain YL [6,4]
LU. However in agreement with the previous results
from yeast episomal expression, the recovery of resistant
or prototrophic cells from the other Pch PRP8 markedinteins again showed that the intein domain did not
impair the activity of the selection markers.
In our experimental design the intein was initially
transformed into a diploid strain so that transformants
could be recovered even if the integration of the intein
impaired the expression or activity of calmodulin.
Diploid transformants were sporulated and the tetrads
dissected to yield four haploids, two with the intein
insertion and two without. The results of the tetrad analysis are shown in Figure 5A. The Pch PRP8 His5-intein
CMD1 insertions grew at the same rate as wild-type,
but both the Pch PRP8 G418 R -and HygB R -inteins
impaired growth.
Associated with the impaired growth was evidence of
inefficient splicing (Figure 5B). The Pch PRP8 His5intein was effectively spliced from calmodulin, producing Cmd1-GFP at high efficiency (lane 3). On the other
hand, the G418 R -intein (lanes 4,5) and HygB R -intein
(not shown) were not. Different isolates showed varying
levels of accumulation of unspliced product (lanes 4 and
5). The slow growth and phenotypic variation of the
G418R and HygR isolates precluded further analysis and
in any case meant that these inteins were not suitable
for tagging Cmd1.
Calmodulin concentrates at sites of cell growth and at
the spindle pole body in yeast [27-29]. The wild-type
localization pattern was seen for Cmd1 with the internal
GFP-His5-intein (Figure 5C). In agreement with the
published results, unbudded cells had calmodulin in
puncta at the cell membrane. In newly budded cells calmodulin formed a patch at the bud tip that dispersed as
the bud grew. Preceding cytokinesis calmodulin was
concentrated at the bud neck. Localization at the pair of
spindle pole bodies is best seen in the medium budded
cell in Figure 5. For comparison the online Yeast
Resource Center Public Image Repository [29] contains
over 2000 images of yeast showing the localization of
CMD1 tagged with different fluorescent proteins.

Discussion
Inteins are widely used in biotechnology to manipulate
proteins. The capacity of inteins to break and form peptide bonds has been exploited to develop a range of
methodologies from a routine procedure to purify proteins, to more advanced semi-synthetic applications that
assemble proteins for NMR, crystallography and
mechanistic studies. These uses and others have been
recently reviewed [10,11,30].
The use of inteins as genetic tools is still an emerging
area of research. Temperature-sensitive inteins [31-33],
light-activated inteins [34], and inteins controlled by
small molecules [35-37], provide a way to control protein activity by controlling when a protein that has been
interrupted by an intein is spliced together to yield its
mature form. Conditional protein assembly by inteins in
vivo is a promising method to generate temperaturesensitive mutants, and target when and where a protein
is functional in a cell.
Here we add a new role for inteins in genetic manipulations, as a genetic marker with the unique property of
self-excision. The engineered intein marks the expression of the protein into which it is embedded and yet
after splicing is not a part of the mature protein. We
demonstrate in yeast the use of a Pch PRP8 His5marked intein to deliver, in one step and in vivo, GFP
within a targeted protein without disturbing the function of the protein. In principle, the method could be
extended to other protein tags, and adapted to other
organisms.
We created a family of genetically marked inteins
based on the PRP8 intein of Penicillium chrysogenum.
PRP8 inteins have an ancient heritage and are widespread [19,38-40]. However they are not found in S. cerevisiae. The Pch PRP8 intein and the native yeast VMA1
intein are sufficiently divergent (21% sequence identity)
to preclude homologous recombination between the two
during the transformation step. For comparison the S.
cerevisiae HIS3 and the S. pombe his5+ genes share 58%
sequence identity and yet do not recombine during integrative transformation [41]. The sequence divergence,
the fact that the Pch PRP8 intein is well characterized
[9,19,20,39], splices at high efficiency across a broad
range of temperatures [19] and lacks a DNA binding
domain led to its choice in our studies.
The primary sequence of the Pch PRP8 mini-intein
shares sequence similarity with other inteins [20]. Thus
its three-dimensional structure likely conforms to the
canonical Hedgehog/Intein (HINT) protein scaffold
[42-48]. The HINT module has a flat horseshoe shape
with a series of b-strands forming the framework. The
active-site is centered at the interior base or “toe” of the
horseshoe. Endonucleases if present in the intein are a

Page 7 of 11

separate domain located away from the active site region
at the “heel” of the horseshoe.
Here we show that the Pch PRP 8 intein, and presumably other inteins, have a remarkable capacity to accept
foreign protein domains at the region of the structure
where the homing endonuclease resides in full inteins.
High splicing efficiency was observed for all of the
inserted single domain proteins that were used for
genetic markers. We attribute the success to several factors. An alignment of the Pch PRP8 intein with the
Synechocystis sp. DnaB and the Mycobacterium xenopi
GyrA inteins shows that the insertion site for our
genetic markers is located in disordered loops in the
crystal structures of both of these inteins [42,44]. Thus
the region of insertion is inherently flexible and unstructured. In addition, one shared feature of the proteins
used for markers is that their N-and C-termini are proximal [22-25]. The exit of the inserted protein domain
out of the intein and its return occurs nearby in space
and would tend to minimize strain in the structure of
the intein. Since the majority of single domain proteins
have some region of their two termini within 5 Å
[49,50] and termini are consistently found at the surface
of the protein [51], we predict that many single domain
proteins could be inserted into inteins without detriment to splicing efficiency.
Three enzymes and a transcription factor were used as
genetic markers to modify the Pch PRP8 intein. In pilot
experiments all four modified inteins showed high splicing efficiency, both in E. coli and yeast, and in yeast
the proteins within the excised inteins were active and
enabled growth under conditions of selection. However
when these inteins were used to deliver GFP within calmodulin only the strain tagged with the Pch PRP8 His5intein grew normally. Under selective conditions transformation with the Pch PRP8 LexA-VP16-intein did not
yield any transformants, and the G418 R -and Hyg R inteins yielded cells with poor growth and diminished
splicing efficiency. The disruption of calmodulin function was surprising, given the pilot results, and is not
understood. It is possible that the unspliced products
which accumulate interfere with growth. We are actively
investigating ways to boost the level of stable protein
and the efficiency of splicing through changes in codon
usage and the composition of the linkers between the
various domains. In addition, given the success of the
Pch PRP8 His5-intein, we are constructing other inteins
with metabolic markers that may require lower levels of
expression.
Our intein based method to insert the gene encoding
GFP within an ORF offers several advantages over other
PCR-based methods available in yeast. Other methods
[52-54] introduce a gene with its own promoter that

Ramsden et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/71

must be first be removed before the GFP is correctly in
frame. Thus a second recombination event is required,
either catalyzed by the induction of Cre-recombinase or
by a rare natural recombination event that is isolated by
genetic selection, to remove the genetic marker with its
associated promoter. In addition the Cre-recombinase
based system leaves behind within the ORF a peptide
sequence coded for by the remaining loxP site, a
sequence that can disrupt activity (unpublished). The
introduced gene also temporarily interrupts the expression of the target protein. With the intein-based method
integration and tagging occur in one step. Since the
marked inteins are inserted in frame, expression of the
target is only disrupted during recombination. Given
these advantages marked inteins show great promise
and complement other available methods.

Conclusions
We have shown that the Pch PRP8 intein can incorporate a variety of selectable genetic markers and still
exhibit high splicing activity. This led to the development of a simple method to insert GFP within the
interior of a protein in yeast. This novel use of an
intein has the potential to provide a way to add, substitute, or delete domains within targeted proteins in a
single step in yeast. In addition it may find application
in other systems as well, such as recombineering, a
method that is also based on genetic manipulation
through recombination.
Refinement of this method is underway at the Yeast
Resource Center. Primary areas to investigate will be the
effect of codon optimization, the utility of other selection markers, and cassette development for other useful
tags such as the FRET partners YFP and CFP.
Methods
Strains and media

KGY315 [55] (MATa/MATa, ade2-1oc/ade2-1oc, ADE3/
ade3Δ100, can1-100/can1-100, CYH2s/cyh2r, his3-11,15/
his3-11,15, leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112, trp1-1/trp1-1, ura3-1/
ura3-1) was derived from W303 [56]. YL(2, 4)LU
(MATa, his3, trp1, leu2::lexAop2-LEU2, ura3::lexAop4SPO13TATA-URA3) is a reporter strain for LexA-VP16
expression [21]. YL(6, 4)LU is the same as YL(2, 4)LU
except that there are 6 lexAop sequences before LEU2.
LAY18-2C was derived from KGY315 in which the Cterminus of CMD1 was tagged with GFP as described at
the Yeast Resource Center web site http://depts.
washington.edu/yeastrc/pages/fm_3.html. Escherichia
coli strain Tuner™(DE3) (EMB, San Diego, CA) was
used for expression and XL10-Gold ® (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA) for routine cloning.
Yeast were grown in either synthetic dextrose minimal
media (SD) or synthetic galactose minimal media with

Page 8 of 11

appropriate supplements, or yeast peptone dextrose-rich
medium (YPD) with added antibiotics [17]. E. coli was
grown in NZCYM medium with antibiotics.
Plasmid construction

Plasmid pGPch-1 (gift of Stefanie Pöggeler) [19] was
the source of the Pch PRP8 intein and contains an
N-terminal extein of glutathione S-transferase (GST)
and a C-terminal extein of a 6 × His epitope tag. pRR01
is derived from pGPch-1. The ΔE sequence [9],
5’-GGCGCCGATGATTCGGCT-3’, coding for GAD
DSA, was replaced with 5’-GGCGCCGCAG GTGCAG
GTGC AGGTGCAGCT AGCGCAGCAGGTACCG
CGGG TGCTGGTGCT GGTGCTTCGG CT-3’ (NheI
and KpnI sites underlined), to code for the protein
sequence GAAGAGAGAASAAGTAGAGAGASA. Six
codons within the intein sequence were optimized for
expression in yeast by site-directed mutagenesis using
the QuikChange® protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA):
Leu2 (CTC to TTG); Gly5 (GGG to GGA); Leu8 (CTC
to TTG); Arg10 (CGA to AGA); Arg46 (CGC to AGA);
and Arg49 (CGC to AGA). Numbering is relative to Cys
(in the sequence CLAK) at position 1.
Plasmids pRR02-05 were derived from pRR1. The
G418R gene, the HygR gene, the his5+ gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the lexA-VP16 fusion were PCR
amplified from pBS7, pBS4, and pDH5 (YRC, University
of Washington) [57] and pBS LexA::VP16-SV40 (gift of
Tzumin Lee, Janelia Farm Research Campus) [58],
respectively. The ORFs were amplified with NheI and
KpnI ends and inserted at the NheI/KpnI junction in
pRR01. All amplifications for cloning were carried out
using VentR® DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA).
Plasmids pRR11-15 and pRR21-25 include the intein
sequence from the corresponding marked inteins in the
pRR02-05 series. However the N-extein is either GFP or
GFP with a nuclear localization signal, NLS-GFP, and
the C-extein is a FLAG ® epitope. In addition protein
linker sequences have been inserted at the junctions
between ORFs. These linkers, L2-L5 in Figure 4, encode
the following protein sequences, with adjacent
sequences in parentheses: L2, (...LYK)-GAGAGAGAGAG-(FWEKACLAK...); L3, (...KGA)-AGAGAGAA(SG...); L4, AGAGAGA-(SAQ....); and L5, (SGFE)-GSG.
The underlined sequences are from the N-and Cterminal exteins of P. chrysogenum Prp8.
As described in Table 1 these constructs were cloned
into 3 base plasmids: pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham
Bioscience, Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany);
pET-Duet modified to contain only one promoter
(EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), and pBM258 [59].
The complete DNA sequences are deposited in
Genbank [60].

All plasmids were constructed in this study except pGPch-1 [19]. In the table the promoter that drives expression of the extein-intein is indicated.

Episomal expression of inteins in E. coli and yeast

Expression in E. coli was performed in Tuner™ (DE3)
with pLysSRARE to express rare tRNAs. Bacteria were
grown to early log phase in NZCYM medium
supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) then induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 17 h at 20°.
Culture densities were measured with a Klett-Summerson Colorimeter.
For plasmid-based expression in yeast from the GAL1
promoter, the strain YL (2,4) LU was used with various
plasmids based on pBM258. Cells were grown overnight
at 30°in S-medium -ura + 2% raffinose. When cells
reached a turbidity of 20 Klett units, galactose was
added to a final concentration of 2% and growth was
continued to 100 Klett units.
Western blot analysis and the estimation of splicing
efficiency

Equivalent amounts of cells were pelleted, precipitated
with 10% TCA [61], resuspended in sample buffer and
separated by SDS-PAGE. Three identical gels were
prepared: one directly stained by Coomassie® Brilliant
Blue for detection of total protein and two transferred
to Immobilon™ (Millipore, Billerica, MA) for Western
blot analysis. Antibodies were either directed against
GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),
Penta-His (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), GFP (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN) or the FLAG epitope (antiFLAG® M2, Sigma-Alrich, St. Louis, MO). Antibodies
were detected using Alexa Fluor 680 anti-IgG secondary
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and visualized on an Odyssey

Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln,
NE). The Odyssey software was used to quantify band
intensity. To estimate the limits of detection for the
anti-GFP antibody, Western blot analysis was performed
on serial dilutions of extracts from strain YL (2,4) LU
expressing NLS-GFP from plasmid pRR26.
Genomic integration of marked inteins into the CMD1
locus

The intein cassettes were amplified from the pRR11-15
plasmids using the Expand Long Template PCR System
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Primers included a 40 base
extension homologous to the target CMD1 gene, a
short linker sequence encoding L1 and L5 in Figure 4,
and ~ 23 bp homologous to the ends of the intein
sequence. The sequences of the primers were: 5’-TAGTGAATTTTTGGCTCTGATGTCTCGTCAACTCAAA
TCA GGTTCAGGT AGTAAAGGAG AAGAACTTTT
CACTG-3’ and 5’-ATACTTTAAAAGCTTCTAGTAGTTCTTGTTCAGAGTCATT TCCAGATCC TT
CGAAACCA CTGTTGTGCA G-3’ in which bold
sequence is homologous to the intein cassette and
underlined is homologous to the CMD1 site of insertion.
The amplification and integration protocols are
described at the Yeast Resource Center web site http://
depts.washington.edu/yeastrc/pages/fm_3.html. KGY315
was the host except in the case of the transformation of
the LexA-VP16-intein, which was transformed into YL
[6,4] LU.
Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a DeltaVision® imaging system (Applied Precision, Issaquah,
WA) as previously reported [17]. Protein extraction and

Ramsden et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:71

Western blot analysis were performed as described
above using anti-GFP and anti-calmodulin antibodies
[62]. The correct integration of the inteins was confirmed by four different PCR reactions using the genomic DNA as template and primer pairs from these
regions: 5’ UTR of CMD1 as forward primer (f.p.) ×
GFP as reverse primer (r.p.); GFP (f.p.) × C-terminal
intein (r.p.); C-terminal intein (f.p.) × 3’ UTR of
CMD1(r.p.); and 5’ UTR of CMD1 (f.p.) × 3’ UTR of
CMD1(r.p.).
