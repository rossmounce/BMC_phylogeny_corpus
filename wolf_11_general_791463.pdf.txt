General lack of global dosage compensation in
ZZ/ZW systems? Broadening the perspective
with RNA-seq
Jochen BW Wolf1,2*, Jarosław Bryk1

Abstract
Background: Species with heteromorphic sex chromosomes face the challenge of large-scale imbalance in gene
dose. Microarray-based studies in several independent male heterogametic XX/XY systems suggest that dosage
compensation mechanisms are in place to mitigate the detrimental effects of gene dose differences. However,
recent genomic research on female heterogametic ZZ/ZW systems has generated surprising results. In two bird
species and one lepidopteran no evidence for a global dosage compensating mechanism has been found. The
recent advent of massively parallel RNA sequencing now opens up the possibility to gauge the generality of this
observation with a broader phylogenetic sampling. It further allows assessing the validity of microarray-based
inference on dosage compensation with a novel technology.
Results: We here expemplify this approach using massively parallel sequencing on barcoded individuals of a bird
species, the European crow (Corvus corone), where previously no genetic resources were available. Testing for
Z-linkage with quantitative PCR (qPCR,) we first establish that orthology with distantly related species (chicken,
zebra finch) can be used as a good predictor for chromosomal affiliation of a gene. We then use a digital measure
of gene expression (RNA-seq) on brain transcriptome and confirm a global lack of dosage compensation on the Z
chromosome. RNA-seq estimates of male-to-female (m:f) expression difference on the Z compare well to previous
microarray-based estimates in birds and lepidopterans. The data further lends support that an up-regulation of
female Z-linked genes conveys partial compensation and suggest a relationship between sex-bias and absolute
expression level of a gene. Correlation of sex-biased gene expression on the Z chromosome across all three bird
species further suggests that the degree of compensation has been partly conserved across 100 million years of
avian evolution.
Conclusions: This work demonstrates that the study of dosage compensation has become amenable to species
where previously no genetic resources were available. Massively parallele transcriptome sequencing allows reassessing the degree of dosage compensation with a novel tool in well-studies species and, in addition, gain
valuable insights into the generality of mechanisms across independent taxonomic group for both the XX/XY and
ZZ/ZW system.

Background
Sex determining mechanisms have evolved many times
independently and range from environmental or social
clues to genetic hard-wiring [1,2]. The two most common forms of chromosomal sex determination are the
male heterogametic XX/XY system and the ZZ/ZW

system, where females are the heterogametic sex.
A widely accepted model posits that in the course of
evolution an autosomal chromosome acquired a sex
determining locus and was henceforth doomed to
degrade by mutational silencing and deletions to a point
where it now only harbors a handful of essential genes
[3]. This results in a large-scale sexual imbalance in
gene dose, which, if not countered, should entail severe
detrimental effects [4-6]. Compensating mechanisms are
thus expected to be in place that reduce the disparity in

sex-linked gene expression and thereby mitigate the
effect of sexual imbalance in gene dose. It thus did not
come as a surprise that diverse epigenetic dosage compensation mechanisms have been discovered in several
XX/XY systems as dissimilar as Drosophila, Mus and
Caenorhabditis and much progress has been made to
understand their evolutionary basis [7].
The recent embarquement on genome wide-research
on female heterogametic ZZ/ZW systems, however, has
generated unexpected results that reinstated much interest in the phenomenon [8-10]: two bird species, chicken
and zebra finch, seem to entirely lack a global dosage
mechanism [11,12]. Though varying across life stages
and tissues [13,14], m:f ratios of Z-linked gene expression consistently deviate from unity. Microarray studies
as well as quantitative PCR (qPCR) based studies suggest values somewhere in between 1 (full compensation)
and 2 (absence of compensation). This indicates either a
lower efficiency in dosage compensation, or that the
buffering capacity of gene interaction networks alone
can compensate for dosage differences [15]. Effective
regional dosage compensation has been described
around the male hyper-methylated (MHM) locus in
chicken [16], but no such regional patterns are found in
zebra finch [14].
Independent evidence for a lack of wholesale dosage
compensation comes from the Lepidopteran Bombyx
mori [17] and has prompted the idea that species with
ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes are fundamentally different
from male heterogametic XX/XY systems in the way
they deal with differences in gene dosage [10]. At present, such an inference may, however, be premature, as
phylogenetically independent sample size is low (two
bird species, one moth). It thus remains an open question, if ZZ/ZW systems in general have evolved similar
chromatin-modifying mechanism as in XX/XY systems
[18], or if the general buffering capacity of protein
interaction networks described for unbalanced dosage
of autosomal genes in partial aneuploids [19,20] sufficiently counteracts the detrimental effects of dosage
differences in the heterogametic sex. Broader taxonomic sampling is needed to understand the diverse
mechanisms by which ZZ/ZW species deal with gene
dosage imbalances, but also to test for the generality of
effective compensation mechanisms in further XX/XY
systems [21].
The rapid advances in sequencing technology over the
last few years open up this possibility and allow validating microarray-based inference with a novel methodological tool. Xiong et al. 2010 [22] recently applied RNAseq data in the context of dosage compensation. Using
datasets on well established models such as worm and
mouse, they reach the conclusion that apparent compensation of gene dosage differences between the

Page 2 of 10

X chromosome and autosomes may simply reflect an
artifact of the microarray technique. RNA-seq data suggested no dosage compensation of the active X chromosome. This striking result clearly demonstrates that the
addition of a novel technology to the study of dosage
compensation will prove valuable and has the potential
to even overthrow current belief.
RNA-seq further allows addressing dosage compensation in a much broader set of taxa on a genome-wide
scale [reviewed in [23]]. In contrast to microarrays
which are traditionally restricted to models organism
with rich genomic resources, massively parallel transcriptome sequencing yields sequence information and
concomitantly provides a digital measure of gene
expression for basically any species [24]. In principle,
this allows inferring gene identity by using orthology
relationships to related species with annotated genomes
and at the same time determine expression levels.
We here demonstrate the applicability of such an
approach for the study of dosage compensation in a
non-model bird species, the European Crow (Corvus
corone). Using RNA-seq data from massively parallel
pyrosequencing we examine patterns of autosomal and
Z-linked gene expression in brain and address how
RNA-seq based estimators of dosage compensation
compare to values obtained from microarray or qPCR
experiments. We discuss the findings with special reference to the results from the two other bird species and
highlight the potential and the limitations of this
approach.

Results and discussion
Conserved synteny

Karyotypes and synteny have been surprisingly well conserved during more than 100 million years of avian evolution [25]. This allows using orthology information
from phylogenetically distant bird species with annotated genomes to assess with high confidence on which
chromosome a gene is located. As knowledge on chromosomal affiliation is pivotal to the study of dosage
compensation, we explicitly tested this assumption. We
took a subset of 21 putatively Z-linked genes as inferred
by 1:1 orthology with chicken and zebra finch and verified Z-linkage by comparing the copy number of a gene
relative to an autosomal control with qPCR. Our prediction was that the ratio of copy number of any Z-linked
gene to an autosomal gene should be equal to 0.5 in
females (ZW) and to 1 in males (ZZ). Since differences
in amplification efficiency between the Z-linked locus
and the autosomal control may lead to slight deviations
from theses values, the more decisive measure is the
male-to-female ratio (m:f) which is 1 for autosomal loci
and 2 for Z-linked loci (E [ZZconc/ZWconc.] = 2). Of the
21 genes tested, 20 showed the ratio expected for a

Z-linked locus and one gene (ENSTGUG00000017495)
was inferred to be autosomal (Table 1). This gene is
homologous to asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, which is
annotated as Z-linked in both zebra finch and chicken.
Several lines of evidence suggest that autosomal linkage
in crows is real and not simply owing to a methodological artifact: the gene has no annotated orthologue on
the W chromosome neither in chicken nor in zebra
finch, all six independent primer combinations yielded
consistent results (Table 1) and sequence data for the
three longest PCR amplification products all correctly
mapped to the Z-linked 1:1 orthologue in zebra finch
and chicken. We also PCR-amplified seven exon-exon
junctions of ENSTGUG00000017495, and in all cases
obtained products lengths consistent with the presence
of introns and of similar size as expected from intron
length in zebra finch (R2 = 0.93, p < 0.001). This suggests that this gene did not undergo retrotransposition,
but may instead have entirely moved from an ancestral
Z chromosomal state to an autosomal location in the
lineage leading to crow.
In birds, movement of complete genes (including
introns) between sex chromosomes and autosomes
seems to be rare, but it does happen. During more than
100 mya of evolution between chicken and zebra finch
approx. 2% (15/745) of 1:1 orthologues have moved
between the Z chromosome and autosomes (BioMart
ENSEMBL Genes 57). Assuming half the divergence
time between crows and zebra finch, one would expect
syntenic disruption for ~1% of Z-linked genes. Under
this premise, finding one aberrant gene in a set of 21 is
not unexpected (p = 0.37, Fisher exact test).
Concluding, orthology relationships between zebra
finch and chicken are on the whole a good indicator of
chromosomal affiliation of a gene in crows and allow for
analyses of gene expression on a chromosome-bychromosome basis. This opens the door to dosage compensation analyses in this species where an annotated
genome is not available. Nonetheless, one should be
aware that synteny is not perfect, and Z-linkage may be
wrongly inferred for a small number of genes. While
this may slightly influence the m:f expression ratio on
the Z, it will not compromise the general validity of sexspecific expression analyses.
Dosage compensation

Compared to gonads and other somatic tissue, brain is
less susceptible to sex-specific expression patterns [11]
and should thus be better suited to concentrate on
effects of dosage differences between the sexes rather

than on sex bias in expression owing to sexual selection
as e.g. in gonads (but see [26] describing the weak relationship between sexual antagonism and sex bias in
gene expression). We therefore used brain transcriptome
data to examine genome-wide patterns of sex bias in
expression levels. From a total of 7564 transcripts for
which orthology with chicken or zebra finch could be
established, we obtained a digital measure of gene
expression and inferred the gene’s chromosomal location on the basis of orthologous relationships. Due to
the high degree of conserved synteny (see above) the
general results are unaffected of whether zebra finch or
chicken are used as a reference. To reduce sampling
variance for genes with very low sequencing coverage, a
subset of 3556 moderately to highly expressed genes
was used to explore the patterns of sex biased expression across autosomes and sex chromosomes.

For the 156 Z-linked genes, male expression was on
average 1.36 times higher than female expression (95%
CI: 1.20-1.55). This is significantly less than the expected
two-fold difference for complete absence of dosage compensation, but differs significantly from 3400 autosomal
genes with a mean m:f ratio of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.97-1.02).
Slight bimodality in the distribution of m:f ratios of
Z genes centering around 1 and 1.36 may indicate
discrete differences in the degree of compensation for
different classes of genes (Figure 1). Mean m:f estimates

across different autosomes were similar (range: 0.891.10, Figure 2). Only the Z chromosome significantly
deviated from expected unity (Figure 2; p < 0.001).
These results lend support to the hypothesis that the
overall pattern of ineffective dosage compensation may
indeed be a general pattern in birds. Our RNA-seq
based estimates of m:f ratios compare rather well with
values obtained from microarray studies in other bird
species. Ellegren et al. 2007 [11] report a mean m:f ratio
of 0.97-1.04 in autosomes and 1.42 for sex chromosomes in somatic tissue of chicken. Itoh et al. [12]
report mean m:f ratios of 0.99/0.99 in autosomes and
1.40/1.23 in sex chromosomes of chicken and zebra
finch, respectively. A microarray study on the Lepidopteran Bombyx mori suggests a mean m:f ratio of 1.41 for
sex chromosomes of somatic tissue, which is very similar to the estimates in chicken. However, Itoh et al. [12]
suggested that microarray data may underestimate the
degree of sex-bias, as estimates of m:f ratios in half a
dozen of Z-linked genes were considerably higher (~2)
using qPCR. Our study adds information with a third
independent method. The concordance of our RNA-seq
based estimates with previous microarray-based data
from other bird species is in contrast with findings from
Xiong et al. 2010 [22] who report a striking difference
between microarray and RNA-seq based estimates of
X- to autosomal expression ratios. Being a digital measure of expression RNA-seq is accurate across a wider
range of expression levels than in microarrays [27] and
estimation variation seems to be considerably lower
[22]. Still, it shall not be concealed that that potential
statistical biases exist [e.g. [28]] and that accuracy
depends on proper mapping and coverage, and that GC

content and the gene set used (which in turn can be a
function of coverage) influence expression ratios. More
detailed studies contrasting expression patterns from
microarray analyses and RNA-seq data are clearly
needed in the context of dosage compensation to assess
the relative bias associated with each method.
Regardless of which methodology is applied, the
degree of dosage compensation suggested by m:f ratio
values is below 1.5 for all avian species and one lepidopteran. This is similar to what has been observed in autosomal aneuploids and artificially induced imbalances of
autosomal genes where dosage differences are also partially compensated [29]. This may suggest that intrinsic
gene network resilience, auto-regulation through negative feedback and competition for limited regulatory factors [5] may sufficiently counter the imbalance in gene
expression due to gene dosage differences in the heterogametic sex. Studies on the effects of autosomal gene
dose, e.g. like those recently conducted in Drosophila
[19,20], are highly important to evaluate the contribution of gene network resilience to mitigate potential
dosage effects.
Upregulation of female expression

As seen above, m:f ratios of less than two indicate some
degree of compensation either by passive resilience of
gene interaction networks or by a specifically evolved
mechanism. Lower than expected m:f ratios can either
be achieved by up-regulation of female or by downregulation of male Z-linked genes. The former scenario
is more plausible though, as in the course of sex chromosome evolution, dosage imbalance in the heterogametic sex should have increasingly experienced counterselection.
In males, log2 expression levels of Z-linked genes (Z)
were lower in tendency, but not significantly different
from those of autosomes (A) (mean ± 95% CI: Z m =
6.14 ± 0.24; Am = 6.22 ±, 0.06; Zm:Am = 0.95, 95% CI:
0.77-1.16)., In females, expression of Z-linked genes was
significantly lower than of autosomal genes (mean ±
95% CI: Z f = 5.86 ± 0.24; A f = 6.21 ± 0.06.). A Z f :A f
ratio of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64-0.95) is significantly above
the ratio given by the number of chromosomes and suggests up-regulation of Z-linked genes relative to autosomal genes in females.
Up-regulation of female Z-linked expression rather
than a down-regulation of Z-linked genes in males has
also been suggested for zebra finch (Zm:Am = 0.9-1.1; Zf:
Af = 0.65-0.9) [14] and is theoretically predicted by a
verbal model from Birchler et al. [30] that posits a predominant role of negative trans-acting effects. This
model is based on the observation that in most cases
trans-acting regulatory genes seem to act as repressors
rather than activators and reduce the expression of target genes (e.g. white locus in Drosophila) [30]. Reduced

Page 5 of 10

dosage in such a trans-acting repressor gene would consequently lead to increased expression of the target
gene. Translated into the context of sex-specific dosage
compensation this would mean that trans-acting regulatory genes located on the Z should show on average
increase the expression of their target genes in the heterogametic sex. In heterogametic females, where
Z dosage is reduced compared to ZZ males, target genes
are consequently expected to be up-regulated. If target
genes are locally confined to the vicinity of the trans-acting gene on the Z chromosome, an up-regulation of
Z specific genes in females rather than a down-regulation
in males should indeed be observed. This fits the observation in zebra finch [14] and is consistent with our data.
However, the assumption that target genes are confined
to the vicinity of the trans acting gene within the same
chromosome is arguably too restrictive. If target genes
are similarly present on autosomes one would also expect
up-regulation of autosomal target genes in heterogametic
females. A male-to-female ratio in autosomal expression
(Am:Af) of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.93-1.08) estimated from our
data, similarly observed for zebra finch and chicken [14]
does not indicate a large-scale up-regulation of autosomal genes in females.
Degree of compensation and level of expression

Previous studies have reported a relationship between
the degree of sex bias and the level of expression, but
the patterns are inconsistent between species. In zebra
finch, male biased genes (m:f ≫ 1) have higher expression than unbiased genes in males, but lower expression in females [14,16]. A different pattern has been
observed in silkworm where there was no difference
between biased and unbiased genes in males, but lower
expression for male-biased genes in females [17]. In
chicken, Melamed & Arnold [16] find no difference
between male-biased and unbiased genes for females,
but higher expression levels for male-biased genes in
males [16].
In male crows, male-biased genes (m:f > 2) are higher
expressed than unbiased genes (0.8 < m:f < 1.2) (Figure 3;
ANOVA: F2,98 = 18.6, R2 = 0.27; Bernoulli post-hoc test:
p < 0.001). In females, expression of male-biased and
unbiased genes are indistinguishable, while expression of
female-biased genes (m:f < 0.5) may be slightly reduced
(ANOVA: F2,98 = 6.70, R2 = 0.12; Bernoulli post-hoc test:
p = 0.046). This pattern largely follows the observation of
Melamed & Arnold [16]. Under a model where dosage
compensated genes have on average a lower level of
expression than non-compensated genes it would accordingly suggest that partial compensation may be initiated
by females [16]. Such a scenario makes sense, since detrimental dosage effects are present only in the heterogametic sex and should entail a selective response in
females.

Figure 3 Relationship between sex bias in gene expression and
expression level. Relationship of male-to-female ratios (m:f) with
male (white) and female (gray) expression levels. While male
expression is significantly higher for genes with high m:f ratio (m
[ale]-biased) the opposite is indicated for genes expressed in
females. Genes with a low m:f ratio (f[emale]-biased) are slightly
more expressed in females. Asterisks indicate standard Type I error
thresholds. Boxes include the 2nd and 3rd quantile; whiskers extend
to the most extreme data points that lie within 1.5 times the
interquartile range from the box; points depict extreme values
beyond that boundary.

However, the interpretation of the relationship
between levels of gene expression and sex bias is not
straightforward. High plasticity in expression levels
depending on age and tissue and additional effects of
sexual selection can create complex patterns. This together with differences in statistical power - may be
reflected in the discrepancy of observations between
studies.
Conservation of m:f ratios across avian lineages

Itoh et al 2010 [14] compared m:f ratios across different
tissues in chicken embryos and across different tissues
and life-stages in zebra finch. Average correlation coefficients were considerably higher for Z linked genes (0.89
and 0.76 for chicken and zebra finch respectively) than
for autosomal genes (0.32 and 0.08 respectively). This
pattern may point towards a compensation mechanism
that is robust across tissues and developmental stages.
A similar conclusion can be drawn from cross-species
comparisons. While no correlation between zebra finch
and chicken could be found for autosomal genes, significant but weak correlations (mean r = 0.19) were found
across tissues and life-stages between the two species.
We compared sex bias in gene expression for age and tissue- matched samples of adult brain from zebra
finch [31], chicken [13] and crows for Z-linked genes.
We restricted the analysis to 41 unique Z genes that
were present in crows and for which m:f ratios were
available for ortholgous genes in zebra finch and
chicken. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.3 to 0.4

(Table 2) and were similar between crows and zebra
finch when compared to the more distantly related
chicken (r = 0.39, 0.40). The correlation of crow m:f
ratios to the more closely related zebra finch was lower
(r = 0.30). This is surprising at first sight, but confidence
intervals for r largely overlap. Autosomal m:f ratios were
available only for a 1265 orthologous between zebra
finch and crow. Consistent with the comparison
between chicken and zebra finch, the correlation was
lower than for the Z chromosome (r = 0.11).
The fact that the correlation values for both the
Z chromosome and autosomes are relatively high compared to previous studies (see above) may partly be
explained by using tissue-and age-matched samples. It
may, however, also reflect the conservative, rather highly
expressed gene set that was selected by mapping success
of crow contigs and 1:1 orthology between chicken and
zebra finch. Pairwise comparison between chicken and
zebra finch with a larger gene set of 109 genes, indicated
a slightly lower correlation (r = 0.34) and could point
towards the fascinating possibility that expression levels,
gene sequence and dosage compensation may co-evolve.
Overall, cross-specific comparison of sex-biased gene
expression on the Z chromosome suggests at least some
degree of conservation across more than 100 million
years of avian evolution and opens up an interesting
avenue for comparative studies once m:f ratios are available for additional species.
Localized effects of dosage compensation

It has been suggested in chicken that dosage compensation in birds may be locally restricted to the evolutionary older stratum of the Z chromosome and that the
distal end of the younger stratum harbors a concentration of non-compensated genes [16]. Such a mechanism,
however, seems to be absent in zebra finch [14]. Under
the assumptions that bird chromosomes are not
only syntenic [32], but have undergone only minor
intra-chromosomal rearrangements [25], we should in
principle be able to study localized effects of dosage
compensation also in non-model bird species. Extensive

studies on linkage in two passerine species suggest that
only minor rearrangements have occurred on the Z
chromosomes between galliforms (chicken) and passerines (flycatcher: [33], great reed warbler [34], blue tit
[35], Siberian Jay [36]), but two other passerine species
where linkage information is available suggest large
scale rearrangements on the Z [37,38]. Accordingly, patterns of m:f ratios differ strongly in crows depending on
whether chromosomal gene locations are taken from
orthologues in chicken or zebra finch (Figure 1 in Additional file 1). This discloses a clear limitation of the
comparative approach using genetic non-model species.
Even in avian taxa, where synteny is generally high [25],
it will be difficult to pin down localized effects of dosage
compensation unless detailed information on gene order
is available. Therefore, species where multi-generational
samples of related individuals are available and allow
pedigree-based approaches for building detailed linkage
maps will be prime candidates for future research. Alternatively, obtaining a draft version of a genome with long
continuous scaffolds is possible by massively parallel
sequencing alone [39]. This opens up the unprecedented
possibility of linking gene expression profiles to the physical, if not exact chromosomal location, so at least large
scale scaffold information in basically any species.

Conclusions
The lack of global dosage compensation in all ZZ/ZW
systems that have so far been investigated reinstated
much interest in studying the relationship between gene
dosage and sex biased gene expression. So far, the study
of dosage compensation has been limited to model
organisms where a wealth of genetic tools is available.
The advent of next generation sequencing techniques
allows broadening the phylogenetic sample which will
be central to our understanding how dosage compensation mechanisms evolve. We here exemplify this
approach for a bird species, the European crow (Corvus
corone), where previously no genomic resources were
available.
In a first step, we established via qPCR that synteny to
distantly related species with annotated genomes (zebra
finch and chicken) is high. This allowed us placing crow
contigs on the correct chromosome on the basis of
orthology relationships. We then generated 454 transcriptome data for eight male and female individuals
from which we derived a measure of digital gene expression (RNA-seq). Our data confirms the global lack of
dosage compensation on the Z chromosome. In contrast
to striking differences between microarray- and RNAseq-based X-to-autosomal-expression values recently
observed by Xiong et al. 2010 [22], our estimates of
male-to-female expression difference on the Z that compare well to previous microarray-based estimates in

Page 7 of 10

birds and lepidopterae. The data further indicates that
female up-regulation of Z-linked gene expression is
responsible for partial compensation and establishes a
link between the level of expression and sex-bias of a
gene.
A potential limitation of our data set was the low read
coverage, which introduced additional sampling variance
and reduced statistical power. However, as technology
progresses, this will be countered with an increased
amount of sequencing data. Higher coverage data will
also allow separating the effects of individual genes and
relate them, for instance, to gene ontology terms.
A more fundamental limitation, however, is given by the
lack of gene order information that can only be inferred
from other species with considerable uncertainty. Gene
order information is important to address if localized
mechanism of dosage compensation exist as has been
suggested for the MHM locus in chicken. This challenge
can be met by focusing on species with high quality
linkage maps or by de novo assembly of a large number
of reads into long scaffolds. The latter option now
seems to be within reach even for individual labs [39].
Data on more species will eventually allow comparative
analyses on the evolution of sex-biased gene expression.
An indication from this study that the degree of compensation is partly conserved for over 100 million years
of avian evolution makes this exciting prospect.

Methods
Taxonomic considerations

The Eurasian crow (Corvus corone) has two distinct colour morphs which are generally referred to as semispecies [40]: the all black carrion crow (Corvus [corone]
corone) and the gray-coated and gray-bellied hooded
crow (Corvus [corone] cornix). Phylogenies based on
mtDNA [41] and several hundred nuclear markers (JBW
Wolf, unpublished data), as well as population genetic
studies based on RFLPs [42], microsatellites [43] and
SNP data [44] fail to separate the two morphs. As
dosage compensation is expected to be a feature shared
not only on the species level, but potentially for birds
and maybe even ZW systems in general, it is warranted
to treat carrion and hooded crows as one species for the
purpose of this study. We still conducted separate analysis for the morphs which qualitatively yielded the same
results.
Transcriptome sequencing

Wolf et al. 2010 [44] pyrosequenced barcoded cDNA
samples from brain of 11 wild caught sub-adult crows
(~2 years old) on a Roche 454 FLX sequencer. The
resulting 856 675 raw reads from all individuals were
assembled de novo into 19 552 contigs from which 7637
orthologues could be identified with zebra finch and

Wolf and Bryk BMC Genomics 2011, 12:91
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/91

chicken. For each of these genes individual expression
levels were estimated as reads per million base pairs per
kilo base exon (RPKM). For details of sampling regime,
laboratory procedures and data processing see Wolf
et al. 2010 [44]. Note that the individuals have been
sampled in the wild and differences in age and environmental condition is expected to add variance to the
expression data set. All results are therefore conservative
and are likely to reflect rather strong effect sizes.
Verification of Z-linkage with qPCR

In crows, inferences on chromosomal locations hinge on
the plausible assumption of conserved synteny with
other bird species [45]. To verify Z-linkage, we picked a
subset of 21 crow genes for which orthology could be
established with unique genes in zebra finch (Bio Mart,
ENSEMBL 57). For each gene we aligned the coding
sequence of zebra finch with all orthologous crow contigs mapping to the gene using CODONCODE
ALIGNER VERSION 3.0.1. (CodonCode Corporation)
and designed one to a maximum of six exonic primers
with predicted product lengths of 50-170 bp using the
software PRIMER3 [46] (Table 1 in Additional file 1).
In order to identify an appropriate control gene to
which the signals from the putative Z-genes could be
normalized, we compared amplification efficiency and
variability of 12 putative autosomal genes selected on
the basis of orthology to zebra finch and chicken. Two
putative autosomal genes, ENSTGUG00000002932 and
ENSTGUG00000013338 that showed similar amplification efficiency in both populations of samples, average m:f ratio of 1 and smallest Ct variability across
samples were selected as normalizing genes. Results
reported in Table 1 were normalized to the signal of
ENSTGUG00000002932, and they were subsequently
confirmed with ENSTGUG00000013338 (data not
shown).
Amplification efficiency was assayed for 12 primer
pairs amplifying 6 putative autosomal control genes and
for 11 primer pairs amplifying 5 putative Z-linked genes
by amplification of 4-log10 serial dilution of the template DNA (100 ng-100 pg). All samples were run in triplicates. For testing of the putative autosomal genes, we
used a mix of template DNA from eight samples; for
the putative Z-linked genes, we tested 4 samples, 2 from
each population and sex. Primers used in these assays
and amplification efficiencies are reported in Additional
file 1 (Table 2 and 3, respectively).
qPCR reactions were run in triplicates on a total of
eight individuals from both carrion and hooded crow
populations (4 males and 4 females) with 5 or 10 ng
DNA as a template using the FastSYBR protocol and
chemistry (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 7900HT
machine (Applied Biosystems). Data was analyzed with

Page 8 of 10

the ΔCt method. The investigator was blind to the sexes
of the animals tested.
The qPCR approach enabled us to measure the concentration of the putative Z linked genes relative to a
putative autosomal reference gene. Deviations from the
predicted mean ratio of 1 for males (ZZ), and 0.5 for
females (ZW) are expected due to differences in the
amplification efficiency of Z-linked primers and the
autosomal control. More important than the absolute
values for inference of Z-linkage is the ratio of mean
male to mean female concentration: E (ZZconc/ZWconc.)
= 2. We used independent t-tests for each primer to
assess the statistical significance of the difference.
Dosage compensation analysis
a) Individuals and gene set

In our sample of the same eight barcoded individuals
used in the qPCR analysis (two adult specimens from
each sex and taxon) we find a total of 7564 transcripts
for which orthology with chicken or zebra finch can be
established. While the longer reads of the 454 technology are suitable for de novo transcriptome assembly,
average per gene coverage for this data set is relatively
low (6.3 reads per individual and gene). To reduce sampling variance for estimates of mean sex-specific gene
expression we therefore restricted the analyses to genes
that were expressed at above mean expression levels in
at least two males and females and where log2(m:f
ratios) did not exceed ±4. This results in a core set of
3556 moderately to highly expressed genes (11.5 reads
per individual and gene). Further reduction of the gene
set (i.e. all 1301 genes expressed in all eight individuals)
would improve the estimates, but introduces a bias
against Z-linked genes, as lowly expressed Z linked
genes are often not expressed in females (due to a lack
of dosage compensation). In the final set of 3556 genes,
no such bias can be observed and - apart from a slight
over-representation of genes on chromosome 2, 26 and
27 - the fraction of genes included for autosomes and
the Z chromosome follows the expectation from zebra
finch (Table 4 in Additional file 1). We therefore consider the 3556 gene set used as a good compromise
trading-off equal genomic representation and precision
in expression estimates.
b) GC content and RNA-seq

PCR amplification during next generation sequencing
library preparation is not equally efficient across all
genomic regions and depends on sequencing context.
A relationship between GC content and RNA-seq estimates of gene expression is therefore expected and has
been reported elsewhere [39]. To estimate the effect of
GC content on expression we took GC values
from zebra finch as a proxy for the GC content of a
crow gene, since contigs are often only gene stubs.

Wolf and Bryk BMC Genomics 2011, 12:91
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/91

Page 9 of 10

This assumption seems warranted as GC content is
highly correlated even between chicken and zebra finch
(r = 0.88, p > 0.001) that are twice as divergent. We find
a significant relationship between GC content and male
gene expression (F3212 = 254.5, p < 0.001), but no relationship with female expression (F3212 = 0.40 p > 0.05).
This results in a significant relationship between GC
content and the m:f ratio of gene expression (F 3212 =
755.4 p < 0.001). This discrepancy is surprising and may
possibly be explained by slight differences in coverage
between males (11 reads per gene) and females (12
reads per gene) and the relative impact of GC bias in
regions of higher and lower coverage.
GC content varies strongly between micro- and
macro-chromosomes in birds and, unless controlled for,
the observed GC bias in expression ratios leads to an
underestimation of m:f ratios on large chromosomes
(including Z) and overestimation of m:f ratios on small
micro-chromosomes. As there is no indication for a biologically real difference in m:f ratios between chromosomes [11,12], the influence of GC was statistically
removed. Analyses without controlling for GC qualitatively yield the same results though the m:f ratios of the
relative GC-poor Z chromosome are lower.

We would like to thank Nicole Thomsen and Elke Bustorf for excellent
assistance in the lab and to several members of the Department of
Evolutionary Biology for helpful discussions. Funding was provided by
VolkswagenStiftung grant I/83496 (JW) and through the Max-Planck Society
(JW, JB). We are grateful to Judith Mank and Youichiro Itoh who provided
expression data for chicken and zebra finch.

Statistical evidence for decreased overall efficiency in
dosage compensation was established as follows. First,
we took the mean expression value for each sex and
gene and calculated the m:f ratio. In the case of complete dosage compensation and equal overall expression
in males and females this ratio is expected to be 1 across
all autosomes and the Z chromosome alike. In the
absence of any dosage compensation the ratio should be
1 for autosomes and 2 for genes on the Z chromosome.
Data were normalized by log2 transformation which
centres the expected values around 0 (log2(1) = 0) and 1
(log2(2) = 1). Deviations from the 0 baseline were tested
in a linear regression framework. M:f expression ratios
were regressed against chromosome identity as the categorical variable. By dropping the intercept an F-test
tests the null hypothesis that all means are equal to 0
(no dosage compensation) and confidence intervals
(Bonferroni corrected for the number of chromosomes)
of the parameter estimates can be used to assess which
of the chromosome deviates from 0. To account for
samples size differences across chromosomes, the
regression was weighted by the number of genes.
The Gaussian kernel density function shown in Figure 1
uses the algorithm implemented in the R density () function. The shape of the curve is robust to modifications
of the default parameters even when different smoothing
kernels were used.

To prepare the data for the correlations across avian
species (Table 2), we started with the chicken Unigene
IDs reported in Tomaszycki et al. 2009 [30] for zebra
finch (7299 genes) and obtained 1:1 orthologues
between zebra finch and chicken Ensembl gene IDs
(BioMart ENSEMBL Genes 59). In cases where multiple
Unigene IDs corresponded to single Ensembl gene IDs,
we took the average m:f ratios for a given Ensembl IDs
and obtained a list of 3042 zebra finch - chicken 1:1
orthologues for which we had m:f ratios in zebra finch.
We then assigned chicken m:f ratios from Mank et al.
[13] (590 genes, unpublished) and crow m:f ratios (3556
genes) to this set, arriving at core set of 41 1:1:1 orthologues between chicken, zebra finch and crow.
