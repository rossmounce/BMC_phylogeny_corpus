Abstract
Background: Guanylyl cyclases (GCs) are responsible for the production of the secondary
messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which plays important roles in a variety of
physiological responses such as vision, olfaction, muscle contraction, homeostatic regulation,
cardiovascular and nervous function. There are two types of GCs in animals, soluble (sGCs) which
are found ubiquitously in cell cytoplasm, and receptor (rGC) forms which span cell membranes.
The complete genomes of several vertebrate and invertebrate species are now available. These
data provide a platform to investigate the evolution of GCs across a diverse range of animal phyla.
Results: In this analysis we located GC genes from a broad spectrum of vertebrate and
invertebrate animals and reconstructed molecular phylogenies for both sGC and rGC proteins.
The most notable features of the resulting phylogenies are the number of lineage specific rGC and
sGC expansions that have occurred during metazoan evolution. Among these expansions is a large
nematode specific rGC clade comprising 21 genes in C. elegans alone; a vertebrate specific
expansion in the natriuretic receptors GC-A and GC-B; a vertebrate specific expansion in the
guanylyl GC-C receptors, an echinoderm specific expansion in the sperm rGC genes and a
nematode specific sGC clade. Our phylogenetic reconstruction also shows the existence of a basal
group of nitric oxide (NO) insensitive insect and nematode sGCs which are regulated by O2. This
suggests that the primordial eukaryotes probably utilized sGC as an O2 sensor, with the ligand
specificity of sGC later switching to NO which provides a very effective local cell-to-cell signalling
system. Phylogenetic analysis of the sGC and bacterial heme nitric oxide/oxygen binding protein
domain supports the hypothesis that this domain originated from a cyanobacterial source.
Conclusion: The most salient feature of our phylogenies is the number of lineage specific
expansions, which have occurred within the GC gene family during metazoan evolution. Our
phylogenetic analyses reveal that the rGC and sGC multi-domain proteins evolved early in
eumetazoan evolution. Subsequent gene duplications, tissue specific expression patterns and
lineage specific expansions resulted in the evolution of new networks of interaction and new
biological functions associated with the maintenance of organismal complexity and homeostasis.

Background
Guanylyl cyclases (GCs) are responsible for the production of the secondary messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP plays important roles in a
variety of physiological responses such as vision, olfaction, muscle contraction, homeostatic regulation, cardiovascular and nervous function [1]. GCs are multi-domain
proteins, which occur in two forms: receptor guanylyl
cyclases (rGCs) and soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGCs). The
phylogenetic relationships among GC isoforms of vertebrates and invertebrates have not been thoroughly investigated. We have used whole genome sequence data to
investigate the evolution of GCs across a diverse range of
animal phyla. Our analyses reveal that the GC family has
undergone several lineage specific gene expansions, most
notably in nematodes, echinoderms and vertebrates.
rGCs were first isolated in the echinoderms, where they
are involved in chemotaxis between egg and sperm cells
[2]. Seven different classes of rGC genes have been found
in mammals, each represented in humans by a single
gene. Two of these genes (GC-D and GC-G), are considered to be pseudogenes in humans [3], while the remaining five genes encode functional rGCs. Two of these, GCA and GC-B, are targets for the natriuretic peptides – a
family of polypeptide hormones that act to reduce blood
volume by stimulating natriuresis and diuresis in the kidney [4]. The GC-C receptor was first described as the target
for heat-stable enterotoxin secreted by pathogenic strains
of Escherichia coli [5]. GC-C is expressed in the intestine
where it is involved in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance and its endogenous ligands have been identified as uroguanylin and guanylin [6]. Retinal rGCs (GC-E
and GC-F) play a critical role in vision, as they enhance
the synthesis of cGMP in a negative Ca2+ modulated feedback loop. These retinal rGCs are regulated by small Ca2+binding proteins that detect changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+
concentration and act through the cytoplasmic domain of
the protein [7]. Homologues of all the mammalian rGCs
have also been detected in teleost fish [8].
The genome of Drosophila melanogaster contains six predicted rGC genes and the Anopheles genome is predicted to
have an orthologue of each of these six genes [9]. One rGC
gene has been cloned from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta [10] and one from the silkmoth Bombyx mori
[11]. The physiological roles of rGCs in insects are not
well characterised, but it has been established that the B.
mori rGC, BMGC-1 is regulated in the flight muscles in a
circadian fashion [12]; that the M. sexta neural-specific
rGC, MSGC-II is most similar to the vertebrate retinal guanylyl cyclases and is inhibited by Ca2+ [13] and that the
rGC protein, Gcy76C, is required for axonal repulsion in
D. melanogaster [14]. Thus it seems likely that in insects, as
in vertebrates, rGCs play important roles in a variety of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/26

physiological responses. The Caenorhabditis elegans
genome contains at least 25 predicted rGC genes [15,16].
The expression patterns often of these genes have been
investigated, and all ten are expressed in subsets of C. elegans sensory neurons. Mutant phenotypes have been
described for two of these rGC genes: odr-1 [16] and daf11 [17] and in both cases chemosensory signalling is
affected.
rGCs contain an extracellular binding domain, a single
membrane-spanning domain, a protein kinase homology
domain (KHD) and intracellular coiled-coil dimerization
and catalytic domains (Figure 1). The KHD has significant
similarity with known protein kinases but contains no
kinase activity; it functions as a negative regulatory element whose deletion by mutagenesis gives rise to a constitutively active GC receptor [18]. The region between the
cyclase domain and the KHD forms a coiled-coil domain,
enabling the formation of dimeric proteins which are considered to be the minimal catalytic unit for human rGC
enzymes [19].
sGCs are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells
where they affect a variety of important physiological
functions including smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation, neuronal signal transduction, blood platelet reactivity and phototransduction [20]. They are activated by
nanomolar concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), a freely
diffusible membrane permeant gas. In mammals sGC typically forms a heterodimer composed of an α- and a βsubunit, each of which contains a regulatory domain, a
coiled-coil domain and a cyclase domain (Figure 1). The
human genome encodes two sGC α-subunit and two sGC
β-subunit genes. The N-terminal portion of the β-subunit
constitutes the heme-binding domain that confers NO
sensitivity to the enzyme. Upon activation of the sGC by
NO the GC activity is accelerated by 100–300 fold [21]. At
the C-terminus of each subunit is a well-conserved catalytic domain. Contained between the heme-binding and
catalytic regions is a dimerization domain responsible for
heterodimer formation. A prokaryote heme binding protein family with significant sequence identity to the heme
binding domain of eukaryotic sGCs has been identified
[22]. This heme-binding family was found in various bacterial lineages, but among the eukaryotes was detectable
only in the animal lineage. Among the residues conserved
in the prokaryote sequences are the histidine residue
which covalently binds the heme prosthetic group and a
YxS|TxR motif which has also been implicated in heme
binding [23]. sGC heme-like domains from the obligate
anaerobe Thermoanaerobacter tengcongenesis and the facultative anaerobe Vibrio cholerae have been cloned [24]. That
study found that V. cholerae protein bound NO, whereas
the T. tengcongenesis protein is capable of forming a stable
O2 complex and has NO binding characteristics similar to

myoglobin and other O2 sensors This heme-binding family has therefore been named H-NOX (Heme-Nitric oxide/
Oxygen binding) [24] and is made up of two domains, the
H-NOB (Heme NO Binding) and H-NOBA (Heme NO
Binding Associated) [22]. The H-NOBA domain occurs
between the HNOB and the cyclase domains in animal
sGCs
[22].
The aim of the work reported here was to utilise whole
genome data from vertebrate and invertebrate animals to
describe a molecular phylogeny for both the soluble and
receptor GCs. The most notable features of the resulting
phylogenies are the number of lineage specific rGC and
sGC expansions that have occurred during metazoan evolution. These lineage specific expansions have resulted in
great diversity within the signal transduction and cellular
communication pathways which are regulated by this
functionally diverse multi-domain GC protein family.

Results
Receptor GC phylogeny
The most striking aspect of our phylogenetic reconstruction for the rGC gene family represented in Figure 2, is

that the majority (21 out of 25) of the C. elegans rGC genes
form a robust lineage-specific clade with strong support
(0.96 Bayesian posterior probability (BPP)). According to
our phylogenetic hypothesis this nematode group is a sister clade to a large strongly supported (0.97 BPP) clade of
rGC genes containing vertebrate GC classes (retinal rGC
receptors, sensory organ rGCs and the enterotoxin/guanylin rGCs) and a group of insect rGCs. The vertebrate atrial
natriuretic peptide receptors form a distinct clade (1.00
BPP). Sequence similarity between the GC-A and GC-B
natriuretic receptors is high and these rGCs group together
as sister taxa. The natriuretic receptors may share a common ancestor with two insect clades as these sequences
are grouped together with relatively high support (0.94
BPP). Also included as a sister group to one of the insect
clades is a single rGC sequence from the echinoderm Stichopus japonicus. These observations suggest that natriuretic rGC regulation may have originated from basal
invertebrates after nematode divergence, as no C. elegans
orthologues are found within this clade. An alternative
hypothesis is that C. elegans may have lost these natriuretic receptors but this would appear to be a less parsimonious explanation.
Of the remaining nematode rGC sequences, GCY-11,
GCY-15 and GCY-21 group together with strong support
(0.98 BPP). This small nematode clade is located beside
insect and echinoderm sperm rGCs. The supports for
these inferences are weak (0.52 BPP), but it is evident that
this nematode rGC group is highly divergent and it may
be evolving at a faster rate when compared to the other
nematode rGC sequences and indeed with the other rGC
genes in this dataset. The remaining nematode rGC
sequence, GCY-12, is grouped beside an insect clade with
strong support (0.99 BPP) and this insect/nematode clade
is positioned beside the echinoderm sperm-specific clade,
but with relatively weak support (0.80 BPP). The echinoderm sperm-activating rGC sequences included in this
analysis group together in a single lineage-specific clade
with maximum support (1.00 BPP).
We investigated the chromosomal locations of the C. elegans rGC genes and compared these with their phylogenetic positions. We observed large clusters of genes from
the major C. elegans specific clade on chromosomes II, IV
and V (Figure 3). Our analysis revealed that there is a general correlation between the chromosomal and phylogenetic positions of these genes, implying that the C. elegans
rGC gene expansion resulted from intrachromosomal
gene duplications. There are some exceptions, for example
gcy-9 and odr-1 are located on chromosome X but they are
grouped phylogenetically with gcy genes located on chromosome IV; similarly gcy-17 is located on chromosome I
and is most closely related to genes located on chromosome V, and gcy-22, which is located on chromosome V

groups with genes from chromosome II. The incidences
where phylogenetic and chromosomal positions are not
congruent are most probably the result of interchromosomal recombination.
EST database searches
To investigate the possibility of finding orthologues of C.
elegans lineage specific GC proteins throughout the Phylum Nematoda we performed a database search of the
nematode EST database NEMBASE and the Brugia malayi
genome from The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR).
From this analysis we identified 30 matches from 15 different nematode species, which span four of the five
major clades of the Phylum Nematoda for which
sequence data is available (Table 1). These 30 matches
contain orthologues of the C. elegans receptor and soluble
GC genes. This finding implies that the distinct groups of

C. elegans GC genes identified in our phylogenies are not
specific to C. elegans alone but are common to all nematodes, a finding that will only be verified when more
whole nematode genomes become available. Orthologues of all C. elegans GC genes were located within the
C. briggsae genome. No homologues of the nematode specific GC genes were detected in the Schistosome or Tardigrade EST databases.
Partial cyclase domain phylogeny with particular
reference to echinoderms
A previous study has shown that echinoderms have many
diverse guanylyl cyclase isoforms [25]. However the
sequence data used in that study contained only 121
amino acid positions from the highly conserved cyclase
domain. To investigate the relationships between these
echinoderm sequences and our dataset, we aligned the

selected nematode genes with the echinoderm sequences.
Examination of the phylogenetic tree derived from this
alignment showed a large number of polytomies (Figure
4). This result is unsurprising, as the alignment is quite
short and highly conserved. Consequently the alignment
lacks enough phylogenetic information to infer deep

branching relationships. There are a small number of
highly supported clades however. For example individual
vertebrate classes are grouped beside one another with relatively high support (93% and 94% bootstrap support
respectively). Similarity particular isoforms from the same
echinoderm species are found grouped together. For
example Asterias amurensis, Brissus agassizii, Stichopus
japonicus and Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus isoforms are

grouped together (Figure 4). There does not appear to be
any differentiation between rGC sequences isolated from
the testes or ovaries of these echinoderm species, thus
there is no evidence for organ specific clades. For example
A. amurensis rGC sequences isolated from the testes and
ovaries are grouped within the same clade to the exclusion
of other rGC sequences. Based on our phylogeny we can
say that there are lineage specific expansions of guanylyl
cyclases within the echinoderms, however we do not have
enough sequence data at our disposal to properly quantify
these expansions.
Soluble GC phylogeny
The sGC genes of vertebrates and nematodes have undergone a less extensive gene expansion than the rGC genes,
resulting in a smaller sGC dataset. Interestingly the sGC
phylogeny also reveals a highly supported (0.99 BPP)
Caenorhabditis specific clade (Figure 5), which contains
five of the seven C. elegans sGCs. The C. elegans sGC genes
are located on chromosomes I, IV, V and X (Figure 5).
With the exception of gcy-32 and gcy-34 which both reside
on chromosome V and group together on our phylogenetic tree, no other relationship between phylogenetic
position and chromosomal linkage was observed for the
C. elegans sGC family. The C. elegans specific sGC group is
a sister clade (0.99 BPP) to the vertebrate β-2 sGCs. The
two vertebrate α classes (α-1 and α-2) form a robust clade
(0.95 BPP) and the insect α genes form a highly supported
(0.99 BPP) sister clade to these vertebrate α-sGC classes.
Grouped with the insect α-sGC clade are sequences from
two mollusc taxa (Limax marginatus and Aplysia californica). All of these vertebrate, insect and mollusc α class
sGCs are contained within a large robust clade (0.94 BPP).
The insect β-1 genes form a distinct group which is a sister
clade to the vertebrate β-1 genes (0.99 BPP). According to
our inference the vertebrate β-1 class is more closely
related to the vertebrate α classes than to the vertebrate β2 class, as it forms a sister clade (0.92 BPP) to the group
containing the vertebrate and invertebrate α sGC
sequences.

Two sGC sequences from C. elegans, GCY-31 and GCY-33,
group with atypical insect sGCs which have a reduced
affinity for NO. One of these sGCs is the M. sexta β-3 protein, which has been shown to lack two cysteine residues
important for NO sensitivity [13,26]. The other three D.
melanogaster sGC proteins (Gyc-88E, Gyc-89Db and Gyc89Db) in this clade also display weak NO binding capabilities and function as molecular oxygen sensors [27]. C.
elegans sGC genes also lack critical aa residues required for
NO activation in mammalian sGC β-subunits [28] and
the sGC, GCY-35 from C. elegans binds molecular oxygen
[29]. The grouping of these nematode sGCs with an NO
insensitive insect GC clade at the base of the sGC phylogenetic tree suggests that NO regulation by sGCs may be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/26

an evolutionary novelty, which occurred early in metazoan evolution. Since the insects M. sexta and D. melanogaster also contain NO sensitive sGC subunits (located
as a sister clade to the vertebrate β-1 genes), the origin of
NO regulation by sGCs most probably postdates the
divergence of nematodes but predates arthropod divergence.
H-NOX phylogeny and alignment
Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the H-NOB domains
from Nostoc and Anabaena were the most closely related
prokaryotic sequences to the animal sGC heme binding
domain [22]. Our phylogenetic tree of H-NOB domain
sequences from animal sGCs and various bacterial lineages (Figure 6) confirms this observation and also supports the postulate that the sGC H-NOB domain was
acquired by horizontal transfer from a cyanobacterial
source [22]. Sequence analysis of the H-NOX family from
anaerobic bacteria (which are predicted to bind O2, based
on results with T. tengcongensis) identified three conserved
residues, Trp-9, Asn-74 and Tyr-140, which were absent
from the H-NOB domains of facultative aerobes and vertebrate sGCs that do not bind O2 [30]. Using mutational
analysis it was found that Tyr-140 was essential for the stabilisation of O2 binding in T. tengcongensis H-NOB [31].
The crystal structure of T. tengcongensis H-NOB shows that
Tyr-140 is located within the distal part of the heme
pocket and is the only polar residue in the lining of the
distal heme pocket [32]. It has also been shown that the
introduction of a Tyr residue into the non-polar distal
heme pocket of the following H-NOB domains: Legionella
pneumophila (at position 142) and rat β-1 sGC (at position
145) results in proteins with acquired capacity for binding
O2 [31]. A multiple sequence alignment of the H-NOB
domains from the basal sGC clade and the nematode specific sGC clade with prokaryote H-NOB sequences is
shown in Figure 7. This alignment shows the high degree
of sequence conservation between cyanobacterial H-NOB
sequences and the sequences in the basal animal sGC
clade. All H-NOB sequences share the following conserved residues: His-102 which is the proximal ligand for
the heme iron [32,33]; Pro-115 which makes hydrophobic contact with the heme pyrolle D ring [32]; Ile
[Val|Leu]-5 which makes hydrophobic contact with the
pyrolle A ring [32] and the YxS|TxR motif (Tyr-131, Ser133, Arg-135) which is involved in hydrogen bonding
interactions with the propionate groups of the heme protophorphyrin [23,32]. Interestingly our alignment also
shows that in the predicted distal pocket region sequences
from the O2 sensitive basal sGC clade have a Tyr residue at
position 141 while the nematode specific clade has Tyr at
position 138 (with the exception of GCY 37 which has
Phe-138). However all β-1 and β-2 sGC sequences, which
bind NO, lack a Tyr residue in the predicted distal pocket
region, and have a non-polar I1e residue at position 141.

Discussion
Guanylyl- and adenylyl cyclases are multi-domain proteins that display a wide range of structural forms.
Prokaryotes possess six classes (I-VI) of adenylyl cyclases
(ACs), five of which exhibit a variety of structurally
unique catalytic domains that are absent from eukaryotes
[34]. The class III purine nucleotide cyclase domain is
present in all eukaryotes, however the diversity observed
in eukaryotes for this class is only a small subset of the
class III multi-domain cyclase proteins found in prokaryotes [35]. In prokaryotes GCs are less abundant than ACs.
To date only a single candidate prokaryote GC gene has
been found (Cya2) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis
[36]. Some authors postulate that the relative stability of
cGMP, in comparison to cAMP, may have contributed to
the absence of cGMP in bacteria, where a rapid turn-over
of signalling molecules is required [35]. There is no evidence for GC genes in any of the complete yeast genomes,
nor have they been reported so far in other fungi [34].
Similarly, while class III cyclases appear to be abundant in
the chlorophyte algal antecedents of land plants, they are
absent in flowering plants [34]. Five class III purine nucleotide cyclase genes have been detected in the Dictyostelium
discoideum [37]. Class III cyclases have also been detected

in several other phylogenetically divergent protistan
phyla, however the diversity of structural forms displayed
by these cyclases suggests that they are of paraphyletic origin [34,38]. The catalytic domains of class III ACs and GCs
from metazoans appear to be monophyletic [38,39].
Functional similarities between the catalytic domains of
metazoan ACs and GCs have also been demonstrated. For
example, targeted replacement of two amino acids in the
guanine-binding pocket of the rat retinal GC-1 receptor
changed its specificity from GTP to ATP, while retaining
its capacity to be activated by Ca2+-binding proteins [40].
Based on whole genome data and individual studies it is
apparent that rGCs are a highly successful and diverse protein family which are utilised by vertebrate and invertebrate animals for a variety of roles in signal transduction
and organismal homeostasis. The accretion of additional
domains to the class III cyclase domain (especially the
extracellular receptor, transmembrane and regulatory
domains, Figure 1) has resulted in a very successful multidomain rGC protein. This modular arrangement has facilitated the evolution of novel physiological rGC signalling
pathways in different animal lineages through modifications to the receptor and regulatory domains. Subsequent
gene duplications have further expanded and refined
these pathways leading to several lineage specific gene
expansions of rGC genes. Among these expansions is a

Page 11 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:26

large nematode specific rGC clade comprising 21 genes in
C. elegans alone; a vertebrate specific expansion in the
natriuretic receptors GC-A and GC-B; a distinct vertebrate
specific expansion in the guanylyl GC-C receptor and an
echinoderm specific expansion in the sperm rGC genes.
Similar domain accretions and lineage expansions have
also occurred in the sGCs, but the intracellular localisation of sGCs restricts the diversity of extracellular ligands
which can activate them to membrane permeant molecules such as NO and O2. Despite this, NO is an important
signalling molecule involved in the regulation of diverse
physiological mechanisms in the vertebrate cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems. The synthesis of NO by
nitric oxide synthases (NOS) is controlled by complex
intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as post translational
modification, co-factor and substrate compartmentalization, phosphorylation and specific interactions with other
proteins such as calmodulins [41,42].
The D. melanogaster genome contains five genes encoding
sGC subunits. Two of these genes, Gycα-99B and Gycβ100B, encode α- and β-subunits which form a conventional heterodimeric NO-sensitive sGC, whereas the
remaining three genes encode subunits with reduced sensitivity to NO [43]. An sGC subunit from Manduca sexta
was the first example of a sGC which exhibited enzyme
activity without the need for co-expression of additional
subunits. This M. sexta sGC is insensitive to NO [26] and
forms active homodimers [44]. The genome of C. elegans
contains seven predicted sGC genes, but unlike D. melanogaster, a nitric oxide synthase gene has not been
detected in the C. elegans genome [45]. The sequences of
all seven C. elegans sGCs are more similar to the β-subunits of mammalian guanylyl cyclases than to the α-subunits. However, while the C. elegans sequences conserve the
heme-binding histidine residue, they lack two critical
cysteine residues required for NO activation in mammalian sGC β-subunits [28]. GCY-35 is required by C. elegans
for avoiding hyperoxic conditions and unlike canonical
NO-sensitive sGCs, it can bind oxygen [29]. Similarly the
D. melanogaster atypical sGCs have also been shown to
function as molecular oxygen sensors [27].
In invertebrates with external fertilization, chemotaxis is a
key event in guiding sperm to conspecific eggs. The jelly
coat of echinoderm eggs releases species specific spermactivating peptides [46] and echinoderm sperm have specific rGCs for these chemotactic molecules. Activation of
sperm rGCs leads to a rapid, large but transient rise in
cGMP and mediates ion fluxes across the sperm membrane. This in turn affects flagellar motion and the direction of movement [47,48]. According to our phylogenetic
hypothesis (Figure 2) echinoderm sperm rGCs form a distinct lineage-specific clade within a larger clade of invertebrate rGCs. Whether other invertebrates with external

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/26

fertilization use rGC signalling has not been established.
In mammals with internal fertilization sperm chemotaxis
is also a critical component of the fertilisation process, but
here chemotactic responses depend on G protein coupled
chemoreceptors. Interestingly, evidence is accumulating
that sperm maturation and the acrosome reaction are
induced in mammalian sperm by stimulation of an NOsensitive sGC [49].
The natriuretic receptors GC-A and GC-B appear to be a
vertebrate specific novelty – each represented by a single
gene in mammals. Their ligands, the natriuretic peptides
(NP), also comprise a small protein family. Available data
indicate that there is a single NP and a single NP receptor
in the jawless Agnathan fish [50,51]. Both the ligand and
the receptor family differentiated during fish evolution in
response to selection pressure to achieve body fluid
homeostasis in osmotically variable aquatic environments. The medaka fish and puffer fish genomes contain
six NP genes [51] together with two GCA and one GCB
receptor genes [52]. This level of complexity in natriuretic
peptide signalling has not been retained in mammals, as
mammalian genomes possess three NP genes and two
rGC natriuretic receptor genes. It has been proposed that
a reduction in the number of natriuretic ligands and their
receptors in amniotes was associated with the transition
from an osmotically variable aquatic environment to dry
land, where the most important aspect of body fluid regulation became the retention of water [51]. These vertebrate natriuretic rGCs are found within a larger clade,
which also contains insect rGC sequences (Figure 2).
Based on the available data it is impossible to determine
if these insect receptors are involved in insect natriuresis.
However, the Bombyx mori rGC found in this clade is
expressed in the antennal lobe [11], therefore its function
is more likely to be involved in chemoreception. The GCC receptor, although also involved in salt regulation in the
intestine, seem to have an independent phylogenetic origin from the natriuretic GC receptors.
In mammals the functional sGC unit is an α/β heterodimer which binds one heme group per dimer. Selective binding of NO at the heme iron activates the enzyme
to convert GTP to the second messenger cGMP. The selectivity displayed by NO sensitive sGC is remarkable, considering that the heme in sGC is identical to that in the O2
storage and transport proteins and that the concentration
of O2 is higher by 3 orders of magnitude than NO in
eukaryotic cells [30]. Our phylogenetic reconstruction
shows the existence of a basal group of NO insensitive
insect and nematode sGCs which are activated by O2,
implying that the primordial eukaryotes probably utilized
sGC as an O2 sensor. The M. sexta MsGC-3 subunit from
the basal clade forms active sGC homodimers [26,44], as
also does its D. melanogaster homologue Gyc-88E [43,53],

Page 12 of 18

while the C. elegans genome lacks sGC α-subunit genes.
However, there is genetic evidence that the β-subunit like
sGC proteins GCY-35 and GCY-36 of C. elegans can function as α/β-like heterodimers [54]. Thus the initial form of
the eukaryote O2 sensitive sGC may have been a
homodimer, with subsequent evolution and diversification of the α and β lineages leading to the formation of
heterodimers, a shift to NO sensitivity and diversification
of function.
Phylogenetic analyses suggest that that the sGC H-NOB
domain was acquired by horizontal transfer from a cyanobacterial source [22]. The H-NOB domain of facultative
aerobic bacteria and the cyanobacteria is predicted to bind
NO [30] and it is clear from Figure 7 that both Anabaena
and Nostoc lack the Tyr-140 residue which is essential for
the stabilisation of O2 binding in the T. tengcongensis HNOB. Thus the primordial eukaryotes probably obtained
a cyanobacterial H-NOB domain which was sensitive to
NO; substitution of one of the hydrophobic residues in
the distal heme-binding pocket by a Tyr residue in the primordial animal sGC H-NOB domain would have
changed the ligand specificity to O2. Subsequent replacement of the Tyr residue in the distal heme pocket by an I1e
residue in the β-1 and β-2 sGC lineages would have regenerated an NO sensitive sGC. Once NO sensitive sGCs
evolved, they acquired additional physiological functions,
including regulation of vascular and non vascular smooth
muscle relaxation and vascular homeostasis [55], antimicrobial and anti tumor activity [56] as well as roles in neuronal survival and synaptic maintenance [57].
Lineage specific expansion of both the rGC and sGC gene
families has occurred in nematodes, the largest of these is
a rGC expansion comprising 21 genes (Figure 2). All seven
C. elegans sGC are expressed in sensory neurons [15,29]
but in addition gcy-35 has a wider distribution, being also
expressed in pharyngeal and body wall muscles and the
excretory cell [29]. The available expression patters for the
rGC genes also implicate them in nervous system function. Previously it has been demonstrated that five rGCs
are specifically expressed in sensory neurons or interneurons in C. elegans [15]; expression of the rGCs gcy-5, gcy-6
and gcy-7 was observed in the ASE neurons which detect
water soluble cues. The rGC gene, odr-1, is expressed in a
subset of chemosensory neurons and is essential for
responses to all volatile odorants sensed by the AWC neurons [16]. Similarly the rGC gene daf-11 is expressed in a
number of sensory neurons and daf-11 mutants have
defects in dauer pheromone response and in their ability
to detect certain odors. The sGC, GCY-35, has been shown
to mediate oxygen sensation in C. elegans [29]. Thus both
sGCs and rGCs have been shown to have central roles in
chemosensation in C. elegans. The chemosensory system
of nematodes displays many differences from the olfac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/26

tory systems of vertebrates and insects [58], largely resulting from the relatively small number of olfactory neurons
in nematodes. C. elegans has only twelve pairs of sensory
neurons within each of its two olfactory amphid organs.
However the relative lack of anatomical complexity in the
nematode sensory nervous system appears to have been
compensated during nematode evolution by an increased
functional complexity and multitasking capacity of individual sensory neurons [58]. For example, individual
olfactory neurons express multiple odor receptors, multiple heterotrimeric G protein α subunits, multiple GCs and
they display a wide range of other, often-novel, mechanisms for signal integration within individual neurons. In
consequence, lineage specific gene expansions are particularly noticeable in nematodes for neuronal gene families. For example the largest and most diverse nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor gene family is that of C. elegans
[59]; novel families of potassium channels have been
identified in C. elegans [60]; a nematode specific expansion in the heterotrimeric G protein α-subunit gene family
has been documented [61] and G protein coupled chemoreceptor genes comprise the largest gene family in C. elegans [62]. Additionally, asymmetric expression patterns of
neuronal genes increases the discriminatory power and
olfactory potential of C. elegans [63]. One such example is
the asymmetric expression of rGC genes in the bilaterally
symmetrical ASE taste receptor neurons [64]. In adult
worms the rGC genes gcy-6 and gcy-7 are only expressed in
left sided ASE neurons, whereas gcy-5 is expressed only in
right hand sided ASE neurons. This asymmetry of rGC
expression correlates with a functional asymmetry of the
left and right ASE neurons and thereby increases the odor
discrimination capacity of the nematodes [65].
The chromosomal position of all "paranome genes" in C.
elegans has recently been reported [66]. The "paranome" is
defined as the set of all duplicate genes in a genome [66].
These authors found that duplications within the C. elegans genome are generally intrachromosomal while in S.
cerevisiae they are usually interchromosomal. Chromosome V appears to have undergone a high degree of selfduplication in C. elegans, as 48.9% of its 4,792 genes are
paranome members. C. elegans chromosomes II and IV
also have a high percentage of paranome genes: 31.6%
and 33% respectively [66]. Three of the seven sGCs and
seven of the 25 receptor GCs reside on chromosome V, a
finding that supports these previous observations [66].
The chromosomal location of all GCs in C. elegans is
closely correlated with phylogenetic position on our
reconstructed trees (this is especially true for rGCs).
Analysis of eukaryotic proteomes has shown that all but a
small proportion of the eukaryotic protein repertoire is
formed from protein domains which have been extant
since the origin of eukaryotes [67]. This trend is also

apparent for the sGC and rGC proteins where the prokaryote progenitors of the Class III purine nucleotide cyclase,
the H-NOX family of domains and the kinase homology
domains have been identified. The conservation of the
linear order of the individual domains of the rGC and
sGC proteins, respectively, together with the extent of
sequence identity across the entire lengths of these proteins from both vertebrate and invertebrate animals
strongly suggests that each protein family is of monophyletic origin. The rGC and sGC proteins detected in the
protistan systems investigated to date are more closely
related in terms of sequence identity and domain topology to adenylyl cyclases (ACs) [38,68,69]. Metazoan
membrane bound ACs are composed of two membrane
domains, each consisting of six transmembrane helices.
Each membrane domain is followed by a catalytic domain
and the two catyalytic domains function as a functional
heterodimer with a single catalytic pocket [70]. In Dictyostelium discoideum the GC gene, DdGCA, encodes a protein
with 12 transmembrane helices and two cyclase domains,
[67], a configuration also found in the GCs of malaira parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the ciliates Paramecium
and Tetrahymena [38]. By contrast, membrane bound GCs
of metazoans have only one single helix transmembrane
domain and one cyclase domain. Thus the animal rGC
and sGC families appear to have evolved after the divergence of the animal and protistan lineages. No rGC and
sGC sequence information is currently available for the
parazoa, so it is not known if the animal GCs evolved
before the divergence of the parazoa and eumetazoa. The
evolution of novel genes by the amalgamation of individual functional domains has been a frequent route for the
emergence of new signal transduction and cell communication mechanisms in metazoans [71-75]. The modular
arrangement of the sGC and rGC proteins has facilitated
the evolution of novel signalling pathways in animal lineages through modifications to the receptor domains and
by combining the cGMP product of GC activation with
distinct downstream effectors such as cGMP dependent
protein kinases, cGMP-gated ion channels and phosphodiesterases. The sGC, while sensitive only to membrane permeant NO or O2, has coevolved with a very
sensitive and complex NO production system which provides a very effective local cell-to-cell signalling system.
Our phylogenetic analysis reveals that once the rGC and
sGC multidomain proteins had evolved in the animal lineage subsequent gene duplications, tissue specific expression patterns and lineage specific expansions resulted in
the evolution of new networks of interaction and new biological functions associated with the maintenance of
organismal complexity and homeostasis.

Conclusion
GCs are responsible for the production of the secondary
messenger cGMP, which plays important roles in a variety

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/26

of physiological responses such as vision, olfaction, muscle contraction, homeostatic regulation, cardiovascular
and nervous function. There are two types of GCs in animals, soluble sGCs which are found ubiquitously in cell
cytoplasm, and receptor GC forms which span cell membranes. We have reconstructed molecular phylogenies for
both sGC and rGC proteins. The most notable features of
the resulting phylogenies are the number of lineage specific rGC and sGC expansions that have occurred during
metazoan evolution. Among these expansions is a large
nematode specific rGC clade; a vertebrate specific expansion in the natriuretic receptors GC-A and GC-B; a vertebrate specific expansion in the guanylyl GC-C receptor, an
echinoderm specific expansion in the sperm rGC genes
and a nematode specific sGC clade. The nematode specific
GC genes identified within this study have expression and
localisation patterns specific to sensory neurons. This
expansion of the molecular diversity in individual neurons may compensate for the relative lack of anatomical
complexity in the nematode sensory nervous system.
Our phylogenetic reconstruction also shows the existence
of a basal group of nitric oxide (NO) insensitive insect and
nematode sGCs which are activated by O2. This suggests
that the primordial eukaryotes probably utilized sGC as
an O2 sensor, and that the ligand specificity of sGC later
switched to NO which provides a very effective local cellto-cell signalling system.
Our phylogenetic analysis of animal and bacterial H-NOB
domain sequences supports the hypothesis [22] that this
domain originated from a cyanobacterial source. It has
been shown that the introduction of a polar Tyr residue
into the non polar distal pocket of the H-NOB domain is
sufficient to change its binding specificity from NO to O2.
Our alignment of H-NOB domain sequences shows that
non-polar residues only line the predicted distal pocket
region of the β-1 and β-2 sGC sequences, which bind NO.
However, all sequences from the basal sGC clade and the
nematode specific clade which bind O2 have a Tyr residue
in the predicted distal pocket region (with the exception
of GCY-37 which has a conservative Phe substitution).
These observations support the hypothesis that the presence of a Tyr residue in the distal pocket of the H-NOB
domain is necessary for O2 binding, and is used to kinetically distinguish between NO and O2 [31,76].

Methods
Sequences and alignments
sGC and rGC homologues were located by performing
multiple BLASTP [77] searches with a cut off expectation
value (E-value) of 10-7 against GenBank. In each case
putative C. elegans GC proteins were used as the query
sequence. The complete pufferfish and honeybee
genomes are not yet deposited in GenBank. These were

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:26

obtained from ensembl [78]. Multiple BLASTP searches
were performed again with putative C. elegans GC proteins
used as query sequences against these genomes, sequences
with significant E values were added to our dataset for
phylogenetic analysis. In total, 38 sGCs and 82 rGCs from
many diverse genera were located (see additional file 1 for
accession numbers). Both sets of proteins were aligned
using ClustalW 1.81 [79] using the default settings. All
alignments were corrected for obvious alignment ambiguity. The resultant sGC alignment contained 1714 aligned
positions and the rGC alignment contained 2021 aligned
positions.
A previous study has shown that echinoderms have many
diverse GC isoforms [25]. To investigate the relationships
between these echinoderm sequences and our dataset, we
aligned the corresponding region of the rGC cyclase
domain of all human, mouse, D. melangaster and A. gambiae GC genes with the echinoderm sequences. We also
aligned the cyclase domain of particular nematode guanylyl cyclase proteins (GCY-11, GCY-12, GCY-15, GCY-21)
to the echinoderm cyclase domain. The resultant alignment was edited by eye.
The H-NOB domain of various aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were compared to eukaryotic H-NOB domains.
Domains were aligned using ClustalW 1.81 and edited by
eye (Figure 7). Accession numbers for additional bacterial
sequences can be found in additional file 1.
Gene tree reconstruction
Bayesian trees for the sGC and rGC proteins were constructed using MRBAYES 3.0B4 [80]. Among site rate variation was modelled by a discrete approximation to a
gamma distribution (4 categories) and a proportion of
invariant sites, the shape parameter and proportion of
invariant sites was allowed to vary through the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain. In total, four MCMC
chains were run for 3 million generations, trees were sampled every 100th generation. Plots of likelihood versus
generation for both gene families revealed that all chains
reached stationarity after 200,000 generations therefore
200,000 trees were discarded as a burnin for both alignments. Clade probabilities for each phylogeny were determined using the sumt command of MRBAYES 3.0B4.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/26

ogenetic trees for both the partial cyclase domain (Figure
4) and H-NOB domain (Figure 6) were constructed in an
identical fashion.
EST database searches
Using each C. elegans GC gene as a query sequence, we
performed exhaustive TBLASTN [77] database searches
with a cut off expectation value of 10-7 against the nematode EST database NEMBASE [83] and the Caenorhabditis
briggsae genome at Wormbase [84]. The version of NEMBASE used contained 130,184 clustered ESTs from 37 different nematode species from four of the five major
nematode clades [85]. All statistically significant EST
sequence hits were extracted and subsequently searched
locally against the C. elegans proteome [86] using BLASTX
with a cut off expectation of 10-7. Significant hits were
confirmed by manual inspection of BLAST alignments.
The purpose of this approach was to confirm orthology
between the nematode EST sequences and the C. elegans
protein sequences. The presence or absence of nematode
specific genes within the 37 species of nematodes found
in NEMBASE was noted. The Brugia malayi genome was
obtained from The Institute of Genomic Research [87].
Database searches of this genome using BLASTP revealed
that this species contains a number of putative GC genes
(Table 1).

Using the same methodology as above, nematode specific
genes were used to search the schistosome [88] and tardigrade [89] EST databases. No orthologues were found for
the nematode specific group of GC genes in these additional database searches.

Authors' contributions
All authors were involved in the design phase. DMO
sourced all known nematode guanylyl cyclase proteins
and DF located subsequent proteins from GenBank, completed genomes and EST databases. DF and DMO performed all EST database searches. DF and DMO
performed the phylogenetic analysis and chromosomal
locations of nematode genes. AMB directed the project
and provided advice on all analyses. All authors were
involved in the drafting of the manuscript and approved
the final manuscript.

Additional material
For completeness we also constructed maximum likelihood phylogenies for both protein families. Appropriate
protein models were selected for each family using the
software program MODELGENERATOR [81]. One hundred bootstrap replicates were then carried out with the
appropriate protein model using the software program
PHYML [82] and summarised using the majority-rule consensus method. Supports from the maximum likelihood
analyses were comparable to the Bayesian analyses. Phyl-
