Background
HTLV-1 is endemic in parts of Africa and the highest
prevalence (5%) in West Africa has been reported in
Caio, a rural area in Guinea-Bissau. It is unknown
which HTLV-1 subtypes are present in this community.
Objective
To compare local HTLV-1 sequence variation and to
describe the phylogeny of the virus in the Caio
population.
Methods
The complete Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) region of
HTLV-1 samples from children and adults was
sequenced. Socio-demographic data were obtained from
routine census data and from interviews. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed to characterize the viruses.
Results
The complete 800-bp LTR sequences from 38 HLTV-1
infected adults and 8 children were obtained. Strikingly,
sequences from many unrelated individuals showed
100% nucleotide identity (e.g. one group of 10 individuals had identical sequences). Phylogenetic analysis
demonstrated that 45 of the sequences belonged to the
cosmopolitan subtype A, subgroup D. One sequence,
Caio4046, was divergent and formed a significant cluster
with the STLV-1 sequences from the Central African
Republic and Senegal and with a recently identified
HTLV-1 strain from a Cameroonian hunter (tentatively

designated subtype G) [1] and belonged to a woman
without known monkey contact.

Conclusions
Markedly conserved HTLV-1 strains of the cosmopolitan subtype A, subgroup D, predominate in this rural
community. However, HTLV-1 subtype G is also present. This subtype has not been described before in a
non-hunter or in West Africa and suggests this subtype
may be more widespread than previously thought. Additional sequencing can give more information about the
frequency of this subtype in Caio.
