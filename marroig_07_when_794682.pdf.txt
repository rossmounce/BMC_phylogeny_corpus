Abstract
Background: How are morphological evolution and developmental changes related? This rather old and
intriguing question had a substantial boost after the 70s within the framework of heterochrony (changes
in rates or timing of development) and nowadays has the potential to make another major leap forward
through the combination of approaches: molecular biology, developmental experimentation, comparative
systematic studies, geometric morphometrics and quantitative genetics. Here I take an integrated
approach combining life-history comparative analyses, classical and geometric morphometrics applied to
ontogenetic series to understand changes in size and shape which happen during the evolution of two New
World Monkeys (NWM) sister genera.
Results: Cebus and Saimiri share the same basic allometric patterns in skull traits, a result robust to sexual
and ontogenetic variation. If adults of both genera are compared in the same scale (discounting size
differences) most differences are small and not statistically significant. These results are consistent using
both approaches, classical and geometric Morphometrics. Cebus is a genus characterized by a number of
peramorphic traits (adult-like) while Saimiri is a genus with paedomorphic (child like) traits. Yet, the whole
clade Cebinae is characterized by a unique combination of very high pre-natal growth rates and relatively
slow post-natal growth rates when compared to the rest of the NWM. Morphologically Cebinae can be
considered paedomorphic in relation to the other NWM. Geometric morphometrics allows the precise
separation of absolute size, shape variation associated with size (allometry), and shape variation nonassociated with size. Interestingly, and despite the fact that they were extracted as independent factors
(principal components), evolutionary allometry (those differences in allometric shape associated with
intergeneric differences) and ontogenetic allometry (differences in allometric shape associated with
ontogenetic variation within genus) are correlated within these two genera. Furthermore, morphological
differences produced along these two axes are quite similar. Cebus and Saimiri are aligned along the same
evolutionary allometry and have parallel ontogenetic allometry trajectories.
Conclusion: The evolution of these two Platyrrhini monkeys is basically due to a size differentiation (and
consequently to shape changes associated with size). Many life-history changes are correlated or may be
the causal agents in such evolution, such as delayed on-set of reproduction in Cebus and larger neonates
in Saimiri.

Background
Since Gould's publication of Ontogeny and Phylogeny
[14] a wave of renewed interest in the role of development
in generating evolutionary novelties spread through biology. Heterochrony, evolutionary modifications in the
rates and/or the timing (onset and offset) of development
[2], become widely recognized as an important agent of
evolutionary change [26]. The study of heterochrony,
while interesting per se, does not take us any closer to
understanding the developmental, genetic, and physiological processes underlying evolutionary change [29].
Yet, the study of heterochrony, even when using size in
place of time, may be quite helpful in understanding evolutionary diversification (see criticisms in [13]). Allometry, the differential and relative growth of organismal
parts may be conceived as a size-based "heterochrony"
[26]. Heterochrony addresses trait change relative to time
and allometry examine trait change relative to others traits
(usually size), the latter being a comparison of heterochronic results to one another [26].
Size and shape are important biological properties of
organisms arising from their genetic basis in complex
association and sometimes interaction with the external
and internal environment. Usually, a large fraction of the
variability in morphometric data is due to size variation
among individuals. Scaling effects might result in shape
changes associated with changing size due to allometric
relationships among traits, unless all morphological components grow or scale at the same rates (isometry). A long
tradition in morphometrics has been to regard size as a
nuisance factor in comparisons of organisms with several
methods being used to adjust size before comparisons
(e.g. [3,39,32,20]). The rationale behind this approach is
to regard size as a plastic feature of organisms and shape
changes, unassociated with size (non-allometric), as
adaptive [40]. Another motivation for developing methods allowing the separation of size and shape was the
need to compare forms with very different sizes [41]. Yet,
size is as much a property of organisms as is shape, with
important functional and ecological implications. For
example, a simple increase in skull size (and concomitant
allometric shape changes) might result in larger animals
being able to handle larger and harder food items and
therefore explore new resources or niches. Here I present
a study of size and shape variation in two New World primates, the squirrel (Saimiri) monkeys and capuchin
(Cebus) monkeys. The approach used here combines traditional and geometric morphometrics, comparative analyses of life-history data and statistical analyses of size and
shape differences to understand the evolution of these
two sister genera.
The subfamily Cebinae, as used here, refers to the two
modern genera, Saimiri and Cebus, which are united on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/20

the basis of dental morphology and proportions, overall
cranial morphology and others skeletal features [9]. There
is now a consensus that these two genera are indeed living
sister clades based on recent phylogenetic studies
[34,33,35]. Adult squirrel monkeys weigh less than 1.0 kg,
on average (males 858 g and females 715 g) while capuchins usually weigh 3 times more (males 2,912 g and
females 2,042 kg). Capuchins occur throughout the Neotropical region occupying virtually all types of forested
habitats, from mangroves and disturbed forests to wellpreserved Amazonian and Atlantic forests. Squirrel monkeys occur throughout the Amazon region to Central
America, but not in the Cerrado and Atlantic forests, also
occupying a great variety of forested habitats. Group sizes
usually range from 6 to 30 individuals in Cebus while
Saimiri had group size ranging from 10 to up to 75 individuals, and sometimes both genera mix together in foraging parties. Besides, both genera share some unique lifehistory patterns in New World Monkeys (NWM), with relatively heavy brains for their body weight [15].
Here I present a study of the morphological variation in
Cebus and Saimiri, focusing on the allometric patterns, differentiation and evolution of size and shape in Cebinae.
Ontogenetic and static allometric patterns and shape (free
of size) variation are compared in order to describe similarities and differences in skull variation between genera.
Finally, these results are compared to life-history traits
and ecology of NWM to understand the Cebinae morphological evolution. All these approaches converge to a simple picture: Cebus and Saimiri evolved from a common
ancestor basically diverging in size. This divergence follows a common ontogenetic trajectory which is basically
revealed by the fact that evolutionary allometry (those differences in shape associated with size differences among
lineages) and ontogentic allometry (shape changes associated with size differences during the ontogeny on each lineage) are highly correlated and morphologically describe
the same changes in the skull. This size evolution might
be caused by life-history changes like a delayed on-set of
reproduction in Cebus.

Results
Static and ontogenetic allometry
Table 1 shows the multivariate allometric coefficients
(ACs), corresponding standard deviations obtained from
the bootstrap, and the lower and upper 95% confidence
limits for each genus. Results for each sex analyzed separately are nearly equal to those presented here pooling
both sexes within each genus and for simplicity are not
presented. Those ACs with confidence limits not encompassing one (isometry) were considered either negatively
(below 1) or positively (above 1) allometric. Eleven of the
17 neural traits (65%) and 9 of the 23 facial traits (39%)
are negatively allometric in Cebus and the same figures for

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:20

Saimiri are 13 in 17 (76% neural) and 11 in 23 (48%
facial). Conversely, 2 of the 17 neural traits (12%) and 6
of the 23 facial traits (26%) are positively allometric in
Cebus and the same figures for Saimiri are 3 in 17 (18%
neural) and 8 in 23 (35% facial). Allometric vector repeatabilities are 0.99 for both genera and therefore sampling
error is negligible in judging vector correlations. Allometric vector repeatabilities were also quite high in the subadult sample (t = 0.98 for Saimiri and t = 0.99 for Cebus)
and therefore sampling error should have a negligible
impact upon the vector similarities. The following vector
correlations were obtained: Saimiri adult × Cebus adult =
0.968, Cebus adult × Cebus young = 0.978, Saimiri adult ×
Cebus young = 0.963, Saimiri young × Saimiri adult =
0.951, Cebus young × Saimiri young = 0.981, Cebus adult
× Saimiri young = 0.980. Furthermore, the following averages and confidence interval were observed in the correlation of each vector against its 100 random permutation
sample: Saimiri young = 0.773 (0.707–0.84), Saimiri adult
= 0.82 (0.759–0.88), Cebus young = 0.808 (0.736–0.88),
Cebus adult = 0.769 (0.697–0.842). Therefore all allometric vector correlations are higher that expected by the correlation of any two size vectors. Additionally, table 1 also
show the PC1total extracted from the V/CV of the natural
log-transformed data used in the MASS correction. This
PC1 accounts for 90% of the total variation in the data
and is quite similar (r = 0.954) to an isometric vector (all
elements equal to 1/390.5). Also, this PC1total is quite similar to the size vectors representing within genus variation
(r = 0.936 with Saimiri and 0.912 with Cebus).
Differentiation with and without size
A MANOVA was performed on the 39 measurements
using sex, genus, and sex by genus interaction as independent variables in order to determine whether sexual
dimorphism needs to be accounted for in the analyses.
Five hundred sixty-four individuals were analyzed and significant multivariate (Wilk's Λ = 0.016; df = 39, 522; P <
1.0 × 10-5) and univariate (all P < 1.0 × 10-4) differences
between the genera were found. There was also significant
multivariate differences in sex (Wilk's Λ = 0.462; df = 39,
522; P < 1.0 × 10-5). Thirty-five variables presented univariate differences in sex significant at P < 1.0 × 10-3, two were
significant between 1% and 5% (BA-OPI and OPI-LD)
and two were found non-significant (LD-AS and BR-LD).
Moreover, there was also significant multivariate sex by
genus interaction (Wilk's Λ = 0.741; df = 39, 522; P < 1.0
× 10-5) and 33 significant sex by genus interaction (31
with P < 0.001 and 2 with P < 0.05) in the univariate tests.
There is strong evidence for differentiation between the
two genera, the two sexes and for the interaction of sex
with genus. Additionally, an ANOVA performed on size
(first principal component extracted from the V/CV matrix
of the LN transformed data accounting for 90% of the
total variance) show significant differences between the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/20

two genera (MSgenus = 530.27, F = 14228.63, P > 10-5),
between the two sexes (MSsex = 10.70, F = 287.21, P > 105) and also significant interaction between effects (MS
genus*sex = 0.39, F = 10.48, P = 0.001), all effects with 1 degree
of freedom (error term with d.f = 560 and MSerror = 0.037).
Therefore all analyses below were done independently for
both sexes, except where specifically noted, allowing also
to properly control for interespecific variation within each
genus.
The MANOVA performed on the original unscaled variables using 309 complete male skulls with genera and species nested within genera as factors was highly significant
(Wilk's Λ = 0.021; df = 39, 252; P < 0.0001) with the single
canonical variate (Table 2) separating completely the two
groups (Figure 1). Correlations between CV scores and
skull measurements are also presented in Table 2. Based
on the correlations between variables and function, the
CV is a size factor because all the significant correlations
are positive, except for BR-LD. CV has large contributions
from both neurocranial and facial traits. The MANOVA
performed on the 255 complete female skulls with genera
and species nested within genera as factors was also highly
significant (Wilk's Λ = 0.032; df = 39, 198; P < 0.0001)
with the single CV (Table 2) also separating the two
groups completely (Figure 1). Correlations between CV
scores and skull measurements are also presented in Table
2. The two CV's (males and females) are very similar with
a vector correlation between them of 0.90. The MANOVA
results with species nested within genus indicate that only
one trait (BR-LD) does not show significant differences
between the two genera (using the conservative Bonferroni correction of the significance level P = 0.05/39) in the
univariate F-tests for both, males and females (Table 3).
Results from the MANOVA done upon the MASS corrected data are quite different from the analyses upon the
original unscaled data. While the CV (Table 2) is also
highly significant for males (Wilk's Λ = 0.413; df = 39,
252; P < 0.0001) the two genera are now widely overlapping (Figure 1). The same pattern holds for females, with
the CV (Table 2) being also significant (Wilk's Λ = 0.642;
df = 39, 198; P < 0.0001), the scores of the two groups
widely overlapping (Figure 1). Moreover, correlations of
the variables with the CV, for both males and females, are
now very small with around half of them being significant
(Table 2). The MANOVA results with species nested
within genus shows only two traits (IS-PNS and PM-ZS)
with significant difference for the females (again using the
Bonferroni correction) and six traits with significant differences in the males (IS-PNS, NA-FM, NA-PNS, PT-FM,
ZI-ZYGO, PNS-APET, Table 4).
Interestingly, the MANOVA performed upon the MASS
corrected data to test for genus, sex and sex by genus

Multivariate allometry coefficients (AC), theirs standard errors (SE AC) and 95% confidence limits (L1 and L2) for both genera based on the first
principal component extracted from each genus within-group V/CV matrix. PC1 vectors were normalized and each coefficient divided by (1/39)1/2
to obtain the AC. Standard deviation estimates obtained from bootstrap analysis. Allometric coefficients with L1 higher that one (isometry) were
considered to be positively allometric with general size (shown in bold and underlined) and conversely, AC with L2 lower that one were considered
to be negatively allometric (bold and italic) with size. ACs with confidence limits encompassing 1.0 were considered to be isometric with size
(normal font). The last column show the first principal component extracted from the whole sample (Cebus+Saimiri) and used in the MASS
transformation.

Results from the GLM analyses for each sex using unscaled data with "genus" as a factor and "species" nested within genus as independent factors.
For each trait is presented the Sum of Squares (SS), degrees of freedom (df), Mean Square (MS), F value and the associated probability (P). Significant
differences in bold.

MASS corrected data.
effects shows only a small interaction of the factors, with
only 3 traits (IS-PM, PM-ZS and LD-AS) deemed significant. Also, few traits are significant between genera (ZIZYGO, BR-PT, PM-MT). Conversely, 17 of the 39 traits
show significance differences between the sexes using the
conservative Bonferroni threshold.
Heterochrony and life-history
Figure 2 shows the regression between the ages of first
reproduction against adult weights, after correcting for
non-independence between points due to shared history
(phylogeny). Notice that Cebus is the only genus deviating
significantly from the regression line. This indicates that
capuchins have a delayed on-set of reproduction in relation to the other genera given that its age of first reproduction is larger than expected for a NWM of its size.
Likewise, Figure 3 shows the regression between the birth
weights against body weight (the result is the same if skull
size is used instead of body weight). Notice that squirrel
monkeys deviate significantly from the regression line.
This indicates that Saimiri babies are born heavier than
expected for a NWM with its body size. Figure 4 shows the
regression of the age at weaning against adult body
weight. Squirrels monkeys seem to lie slightly below the
95% confidence interval of the regression line indicating
that they are weaned earlier than expected for a NWM of

its size. Conversely, capuchins seem to deviate from the
regression line in the upper direction, suggesting that they
are weaned later that expected for a NWM of its size. Figure 5 show the regression of the fetal growth rate (birth
weight/gestation length) against adult body weight.
Saimiri and Cebus lie slightly above the regression line.
These patterns seem to be robust to within genus between
species variation in life-history data. Unfortunately, complete information on life-history traits is not available for
all species within each genus as well as solid phylogenetic
hypotheses for all species within each of the two genera.
Growth trajectories
I tested the assumption of size as a proxy for age by
regressing size (PC1) against developmental age codes
([30], ages 1 to 6) separately for males and females. Cebus
data was used because the juveniles and sub-adult sampling is much more extensive in this genus and have sex
information available. Both regressions were highly significant (P < 0.00001) and the multiple R was 0.80 for
females and 0.82 for males. Similar analyses in Saimiri
(but ignoring sex dimorphism due to lack of sex in most
of the juvenile and sub-adult sample) show also a similar
multiple R (0.81). Furthermore, for Cebus apella at least
there is available information for absolute age (in
months) for each age class based on dental eruption (see

Figure 2
Comparative phylogenetic regression of life-history traits
Comparative phylogenetic regression of life-history traits. Plot of the age of first reproduction against adult weight in
New World Monkeys controlling for shared history (phylogeny). The regression line and 95% confidence limits were obtained
from the method described in Garland and Ives (2000) and implemented in package PDAP in MESQUITE.

Table 2 in [30]). Therefore is possible to calculate the correspondence between absolute size, time and age classes.
Age classes and the natural log of age (in months) present
a correlation of 0.97 for males of Cebus apella. Absolute
time and size are also highly correlated (0.82) again indicating that size is a reasonable proxy to time. Given that
absolute age is not available for the genus Saimiri, I use
dental age classes here in the paper as a "developmental
marker" and absolute size as an estimate of time.
Comparison of the growth trajectories are summarized in
Figure 6 and Table 5. Most traits present a linear trajectory
in the ln-scale, but some exceptions occur. Two general
patterns are evident: 1) simple extension/truncation of the
growth trajectory (Fig. 7a, 7b) 2) a step along the size
(time) axis causing a shift in the otherwise parallel trajectories with Saimiri above (Fig. 7c, d). Most traits conform
to one of these two patterns with a few exceptions. A

group of such exceptions correspond to those traits which
present very low correlation with size (Table 5) including
traits LD-AS, BR-LD, OPI-LD, BA-OPI (Fig. 7e,f). Twentysix traits (67% of all traits) can be assigned to pattern 1
(simple extension) and nine traits (23%) to pattern 2
(step along the size axis) (see Table 5).
Geometric morphometrics
Centroid size is highly correlated with PC1 score derived
from the linear distances (R = 0.999, P < 0.0001). Also,
centroid size and PC1 score are linearly related when both
are in ln scale. Therefore I use the natural log of the centroid size as a measure of absolute skull size. Figure 7
show the plot of the first PC-3D against centroid size [see
Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This PC1-3D basically represents allometric variation in shape associated
with size, accounting for 51.5% of all variation in shape.
Starting from the smaller values (Saimiri young's), mor-

phologically PC1-3D represents a lowering of the cranial
vault with a large dislocation of landmark BR to a more
posterior position as well as a relatively smaller posterior
cranial base with a large dislocation of landmark LD to a
more anterior position. Therefore, a major change
described by this PC1-3D is that involving the neurocranium, with changes in the height of the vault associated
with the base/back of the skull, involving landmarks LD,
BR and to a lesser extent AS. These landmarks are dislocated from a more posterior (LD) and lateral (AS) position in Saimiri babies to a more anterior (LD) and medial
position (AS) in Cebus adults. Those changes in landmarks
BR and LD dominates the PC1-3D which can be easily
observed from a vector of changes in landmarks coordinates comparing the upper and higher limits of variation
described by PC1-3D (Table 6). Another change in shape
associated with PC1-3D is in the face, being more prog-

nathic (landmarks IS and PM) in the upper end (Cebus),
with a longer and slender palate (landmark MT) and the
zygomatic arch (more robust and lateral – landmarks ZI
and ZYGO). Also associated with this PC1-3D is the dislocation of landmarks PT and TSP to a more medial position
resulting in a more slender skull in Cebus (Figure 7). Figure 8 present the plot of the second PC-3D against size.
This PC2-3D is basically an ontogenetic vector accounting
for 15.6% of all variation in shape. The PC2-3D represents
(again starting from the smaller values – Cebus and Saimiri
young's) a relative decrease in the neurocranium region
with landmark BR once more involved but this time being
dislocated to a forward and lower position. Also, an
enhanced prognathism resulting from landmarks IS and
PM being dislocated forward and upward. Another
change involves landmarks MT and ZI being dislocated
forward and to a lower position resulting in a palate

region comparatively smaller, face more prognathic and
with a more robust pre-zygomatic region. Also, the cranial
base is to some extent relatively smaller with landmark
TSP being dislocated to a more posterior position and
closer to landmarks APET, BA, TS and JP. Contributing to
PC2-3D is also, and again, a dislocation of landmarks LD
to a more anterior position and AS to a more medial position, exactly the same change described in PC1-3D. So, to
some extent changes in shape described by PC1-3D and
PC2-3D are similar (Table 6).

Both PC1-3D and PC2-3D are highly correlated with size
variation within each genus (Table 7). Also, PC1-3D and
PC2-3D are also highly correlated between them within
each of the two genera. PC1-3D is also highly correlated
with size among genera (R = 0.98, P < 10-5), while PC2-3D
scores are uncorrelated (R close to zero) with both size
and PC1-3D among genera (as expected because PC1 and
PC2 are by definition extracted as orthogonal vectors). All
other PC's variables are uncorrelated with size (from PC3
to PC 40).

Only the PC1-3D presents significant differences between
Cebus and Saimiri (t = 53.97, df = 231.6, P < 10-5) and
this difference holds for all age classes analyzed separately. All other PC's variables, that cumulatively account
for 97% of all shape variation (from PC2 to PC 40) do not
present any significant differences between the two genera.

Discussion
Sexual dimorphism in Cebus and Saimiri is well marked,
either in the original traits or the MASS corrected data.
Indeed, 33 of the unscaled traits show significant sexual
dimorphism in Cebus and 30 in Saimiri, using the conservative Bonferroni threshold. After removing scale differences, MASS corrected data show 17 traits with significant

sexual dimorphism in Cebus and 11 in Saimiri (again
using the 0.05/39 threshold). Males in both genera are
larger than females, but skull size dimorphism is more
evident in Cebus (on average females are 66% of the males
size) while in Saimiri females are on average 82% of the
males. Besides, both sexes share a high similarity in their
allometric vector correlation (0.948 in Cebus and 0.945 in
Saimiri). Altogether these results suggests that sexual
dimorphism in Cebinae is not simply a function of size
related differences. In other words, if females were to grow
to the same size as males in either Saimiri or Cebus, sexual
dimorphism in shape would still be evident. Therefore
nearly all analyses were performed separately for each sex.
Differences between the two genera are massive (Figure 1)
considering the original data, with Mahalanobis D2 distances pointing out the complete separation of the two
groups in both sexes (D2males = 1299 and D2females = 1374).

Conversely, there is a wide overlap between both genera
considering the MASS corrected data (Figure 1) with very
low D2 distances (D2males = 3.84 and D2females = 1.74).
Moreover, 38 of the 39 original traits show significant differences (P > 10-5) between the two genera in both sexes.
Conversely, only two traits show significant differences
between the two genera after correcting for scaling differences (MASS data) in females. Males present a slightly
larger differentiation with 6 traits showing significant differences between the genera in the MASS corrected data.
Taken together these results suggest that most of the differences between Cebus and Saimiri are related to size.
Indeed, the only trait in the original scale not showing significant differences between the two genera (BR-LD) is the
only one not influenced by size (Table 1 PC1total). This is
an interesting result given that these two landmarks BR
and LD are by far the most influential in the shape
changes described by PC1-3D and PC2-3D. In fact, given

that PC1-3D is the axis of major differentiation between
Saimiri and Cebus, and that BR is dislocated to a more posterior and lower position while LD is dislocated forward
that explain why the linear distance between the two landmarks is basically the same in both genera, despite the
huge size difference between them. This can also be
observed in the additional on-line material [see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], particularly on the lateral view. After removing scale differences from the data
(MASS correction) the large differences between the two
genera nearly disappear, with only a small differentiation
being observed. These results from the Euclidean distances analyses are totally consistent with the results
obtained from the geometric morphometrics approach.
Moreover, these results also show that males are some-

what more differentiated than females, after removing
scale differences. In short, for the most part, squirrel monkeys are scaled down versions of capuchins, or vice versa.
Allometric vectors are much more similar than expected
by chance in all comparisons as indicated by the comparisons of observed vectors correlations against its random
permutations. This can be quantified by the angles
formed between those allometric vectors, with observed
angles ranging from 11.18° to 18.01°, well below the
minimum expected angle of 28.36 ° from the random
permutations. Given strong similarity in the allometric
vectors of Cebus and Saimiri, and that most of the differences between them are size-related, it is seems clear that
during the evolutionary diversification of these two sister

genera size plays a major role. Conservation of allometric
patterns in Cebus and Saimiri suggest that they simply follow the same growth patterns but evolved to attain different adult final sizes (Figure 6a, b). This conclusion is
reinforced by the results of the geometric Morphometrics
approach where the absolute magnitude of changes in
landmarks position along PC1-3D and PC2-3D between
consecutive age classes within Saimiri and Cebus are compared. All vectors of change are similar either within or
between genus and present vectors correlation above 0.97,
which again is well above the expected range from the random permutation tests (0.60–0.87).
In a size-based scheme for heterochrony (see page 42 in
[26]) this would suggest that Saimiri evolved its small size
by some sort of ontogenetic scaling or allometric progenesis or conversely, Cebus evolved its larger size by hypermorphosis, or both processes were involved since the

genera diverged from their last common ancestor. At
present is impossible to know the direction of change or
in other words, which is the ancestral condition and
which derived. Furthermore, both processes might have
happen while both genera diverged from an ancestor of
intermediate size.
Yet, despite conservation of allometric patterns, a broader,
and perhaps more interesting, picture arises when we look
at the comparison of growth trajectories (Table 5). Comparison of growth trajectories suggests two general and
diverse underlying changes in development (Figure 6).
Pattern one corresponds to an extension/truncation of the
growth trajectory and occurs in 67% of all traits (Fig. 7a,
b). Pattern two corresponds to a translation (see Fig. 4a in
[31]) or height of otherwise parallel trajectories (Fig. 7c,
d) and accounts for 23% of all traits. Therefore, developmental changes involved in the Cebus-Saimiri evolution

seem to be to a larger part mix of two different heterochronic patterns: progenesis-hypermorphosis and prepostdisplacement if we take a classic Morphometrics
approach.
But, what light can be shed on this discussion by the
results of the geometric morphometrics approach? First, is
clear that the PC1-3D is an allometric size vector with a
correlation of 0.97 with absolute size (centroid size). This
is also the axis of major differentiation between the two
genera and in fact the only one where they do not overlap
and present a significant difference on a series of t-tests
performed upon each of the first 40 PC's of the 3D analyses. These results are quite similar to the ones obtained
with the canonical variate analyses done upon the original
and the MASS data and basically reinforce the point that
Cebus is a scaled-up version of Saimiri.

Also, the orientation of the PC1-3D is basically the same
between the two genera (regression slope of PC1-3D
against centroid size: k = 0.273, 95% CI 0.249–0.298 for
Cebus and k = 0.265, 95% CI 0.217–0.314 for Saimiri).
Second, PC2-3D is also an allometric vector with a high
correlation with size if the focus is the within genus variation (r = 0.81 in Cebus and r = 0.70 in Saimiri). Indeed,
PC2-3D is also highly correlated with PC1-3D (r = 0.77 in
Cebus and r = 0.87 in Saimiri). Furthermore, the orientation of the PC2-3D is also basically the same between the
two genera (regression slope of PC2-3D against size: k =
0.351, 95% CI 0.312–0.389 for Cebus and k = 0.293, 95%
CI 0.231–0.356 for Saimiri). Considering all these results
both PC's 3D can be interpreted as allometric vectors. In
other words, PC2-3D represents ontogenetic allometry
(Fig. 8) while PC1-3D represents evolutionary allometry
(Fig. 7). In fact, changes in both PC's seem to some extent

similar involving basically the neurocranium, face and
zygomatic regions and it is not a surprise that both represent allometric variation.
What these results inform us about the evolution of Cebus
and Saimiri? First, almost all differentiation between these
two genera is related to size/scaling. Second, these differences either in scale (absolute size) or shape associated
with size (allometry) follow a common evolutionary trajectory (Fig. 7). This last point is also totally supported by
the correlation between absolute size, the axis of differentiation between the two genera (CV1), and PC1-3D (all
R's larger than 0.98). Thirdly, ontogenetic variation in
shape in one genus is parallel to the ontogenetic variation
in the other. In other words, ontogenetic allometry follows a common and parallel trajectory between Cebus and
Saimiri (Fig. 8) while the latter genus obviously start from
a different point due to the huge difference in absolute
size among them (Saimiri newborns weight 109 g while
Cebus newborns weight 235 g). Fourthly, ontogenetic and
evolutionary allometries are correlated. Considering all
these findings together it seem correct to conclude that the

evolution of these two genera results from developmental
changes tweaking with body size and that nearly all differences observed among adult morphologies are a consequence of this size scaling. It is impossible at this time to
polarize this change and in fact, it might well be the case
that after the split from their common ancestor Cebus and
Saimiri both diverges in opposite directions, Cebus scaling
up and Saimiri scaling down.
What role might life-history evolution play in triggering
those morphological changes? Figure 2 show that Cebus
has a delayed on-set of reproduction. This is consistent
with 67% of the traits growth trajectories and with the
hypermorphic condition of Cebus and suggests that the
extension of the growth trajectory was attained by delaying the age of first reproduction. Conversely, figure 3
shows that Saimiri neonates are born heavier than
expected for a NWM of its size and this suggests that the
height observed in the trajectories, where Saimiri is translated above Cebus (23% of all traits) might be explained
by this larger starting point for the post-uterine growth
period. Figure 4 also add another piece in this puzzle,

showing that Cebus infants are weaned later than expected
for a NWM of its size while the reverse is true for squirrel
monkeys. Delayed weaning and age of first reproduction
suggests that Cebus has a very slow developmental pattern
compared to the rest of the NWM. Early weaning in
Saimiri would suggest at first the reverse, but others factors
should be considered here in judging whether or not
Saimiri present a "fast" or " slow" life-history pattern.
Saimiri neonates are born relatively heavy and represent
almost 14% of the total weight of the mother, representing the largest pre-natal investment in NWM [11] in a single newborn (tamarins and marmosets which usually
have twins invest even more if we consider litter weight).
Squirrel monkey mothers also usually do not have support from group members in raising their infants which
should impose a heavy burden on them. Saimiri compen-

sate for this burden by a prolonged interbirth interval
[11]. Garber and Leigh also point out that in Saimiri "An
ontogenetic trajectory associated with large neonatal body
size and rapid neurological development may facilitate
early foraging independence, thus shifting metabolic costs
away from the mothers and to the developing individual".
After weaning, developing young follow a long and slow
growth trajectory [11], which in a way is similar to their
sister clade, Cebus. Figure 5 sheds additional light on this
point, because the Cebus/Saimiri clade is characterized by
the highest pre-natal growth rates among NWM, after
accounting for differences in adult body size (and historical relatedness). Because most of neurocranial growth
occurs during the pre- and peri-natal period, this faster
growth in capuchins and squirrel monkeys accounts for
the largest encephalization index in this clade within

NWM [15], which can also be observed in the very long
neural region in Saimiri and Cebus young's (Figures 7 and
8). Conversely, Cebus and Saimiri post-natal growth rates
are among the lowest among NWM (Table 8). Therefore,
summarizing all these life-history changes, the whole
clade of capuchin/squirrel monkeys might be characterized by fast pre-natal growth and very slow post-natal
growth. This is an interesting conclusion, because while
obviously Saimiri represents a paedomorphic (juvenilized) morphology and Cebus a peramorphic (adult like)
morphology when compared to one another, the whole
clade might be considered paedomorphic relative to
NWM as a whole.

Conclusion
Saimiri and Cebus represent a unique radiation within the
NWM in many aspects. The differentiation of these two
genera from their common ancestor is, to a large extent,
due to size evolution. Most morphological differences
between these two genera are related to scaling. Furthermore, this scaling is to a large extent due to a simple extension/truncation of growth, but also includes pre- and
post-displacement. Several life-history changes seem correlated to, or perhaps are even causal of the morphological diversification of Cebus and Saimiri; such as delayed
on-set of reproduction in Cebus, faster pre-natal growth
rates and delayed weaning in Cebus, and accelerated weaning in Saimiri. Post-natal life-history is also slow in both
genera relative to other NWM.

for species and sexual variation. Additional 41 specimens
were discarded because they lost sex information (NM =
309 and NF = 255 for males and females).
An additional sample of 161 sub-adult and juveniles
Cebus and 90 Saimiri skulls of varied age were also measured. Dental eruption sequence for all New World Monkeys was described in detail by [8]. I use the same
developmental age (DA) criteria described in [30] and
DA6 correspond to adult specimens. The following samples sizes were available for Cebus: DA1 (N = 25), DA2 (N
= 22), DA3 (N = 41), DA4 (N = 13), DA5 (N = 60), DA6
(N = 379); and for Saimiri: DA1 (N = 9), DA2 (N = 2), DA3
(N = 4), DA4 (N = 10), DA5 (N = 65), DA6 (N = 226).
Young samples (DA1 to DA4) not always present sex or
species identification available and often lack any information regarding locality or accompanying skin that
would allow proper identification of species and sex. The
sampling here was as complete and throughout as possible but this lack of information result in a lack of power
to perform growth analyses controlling for sexual and
interespecific differentiation. However, most young and
sub-adult samples (DA1 to DA5) are concentrated on two
species, Cebus apella (99% of all specimens) and Saimiri
sciureus (81%). Because the major goal here is to understand the differentiation and evolution of size and shape
between the two genera the effect of uncontrolled sexual
and specific variation within each genus would be to
increase dispersion among points and consequently blur
any observed pattern among genera. Results presented
here are straightforward in this respect with a clear characterization of evolutionary and ontogenetic allometry (Figures 7 and 8) that seems robust for these other
uncontrolled sources of variation (sex and species).
The specimens are deposited at the following institutions:
American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), Museu de
Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo (MZUSP), Museu
Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (MNRJ), Museu Paranaense
Emílio Goeldi (MPEG) and National Museum of Natural
History (USNM). A complete list of measured specimens
sorted by taxon and museum collection may be obtained
from the author upon request. Only adult crania were
used in the subsequent analyses, except where specifically
noted. Specimens were considered adult when they had
fully erupted and functional dentition as well as closed or
fused spheno-occipital and/or spheno-ethmoid sutures.
Non-adult specimens correspond to a mixed age sample
containing all tooth stages from a completely deciduous
dentition to a permanent dentition except a functional
canine or third molar [8].
Three-dimensional co-ordinates were recorded for 36
landmarks (Figure 9 and Table 9) using a Polhemus
3Draw or a Microscribe 3Dx digitizer. A small scale exper-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/20

iment was performed measuring a sub-sample of 20 specimens twice in each of the two digitizers. No significant
differences were found between the digitizers. The general
procedure for measuring specimens follows [6]. A set of
70 linear measurements describing cranial morphology
was calculated from the co-ordinate values. This was
reduced to a set of 39 measurements, after averaging
measurements present on both sides of the skull (Tables 9
and 10). Whenever one of the skull sides was damaged,
preventing me from taking any particular measurement,
the other side is used. All results are presented in millimeters. All statistical analyses were performed using SYSTAT
11 (Richmond, CA).
A total of 564 adult and 251 juveniles skulls with all 39
measurements (without missing values) were used in the
analyses below. Juveniles were only used in the allometry
analyses and were not included in the differentiation analyses. In this study I tested for differences between the taxa,
the sexes and interaction between the sexes and taxa using
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Given that
squirrel and capuchin monkey species present sexual
dimorphism with males usually larger than females, sexes
were analyzed separately.
Analyses
Interespecific Differentiation – Differences among Cebinae skulls were examined using the general linear model
(GLM) module in SYSTAT 11 to perform a MANOVA and
canonical variate analyses. Moreover, because the sampling includes several species within each genus and is not
balanced in terms of the numbers of specimens per species, the MANOVA was performed for each sex with species nested within genus. In this way the between species
variation within genus is accounted for so that the
between genera differentiation is not inflated. Therefore
the general linear model includes genus and species
nested within genus as the two independent factors. For
estimating the degree of differentiation among Cebus and
Saimiri, Mahalanobis D2 distances between group averages in the canonical function were calculated.

Allometry and scaling correction – The first principal component extracted from the ln-transformed data pooled
within-group variance/covariance matrix of each genus
and sex was computed. Because sexual variation in allometric patterns were small, detailed comparisons of allometric coefficients are presented only for the two genera.
The thirty-nine standardized PC1 coefficient values of
each group were divided by (1/√39) to assess divergence
from isometry [16]. In order to compare allometric coefficients among Cebinae, it is important to determine the
associated error of those values. A bootstrap procedure
was used to set 95% confidence limits (L1 and L2) to the
allometric coefficients (AC's) (see page 34 in [22]). A hun-

Landmarks recorded in Cebinae primates skulls using the three-dimensional digitizer. The designation A (anterior) or P (posterior) after the
landmark name indicates in which position(s) the landmark was recorded. Landmarks are also identified in Figure 9. The order that each landmark
was recorded is also presented (see additional movies material).

dred bootstrap samples of N = 300 were taken and used to
set up 95% confidence limits to AC's. Allometric coefficients with L2 below 1.0 were considered to be negatively
allometric and conversely those AC's with L1 above 1.0
were considered positively allometric. For the juveniles a
hundred bootstrap samples of N = 101 for Cebus and N =
26 for Saimiri were used to set 95% confidence limits to
AC's.
The overall similarity of the allometric patterns is quantified with vector correlations, which measure similarity of
vector orientation in a p-dimensional space (p being the
number of traits). Vector correlations are equal to the
cosine of the angle between vectors. The expected range of
vector correlations commonly occurring among 39-element vectors by chance alone is -0.4 < r < 0.4 [1] with an
average of 0.127 and a standard deviation of 0.095. Additionally, because there is a sampling error associated with
each estimated allometric vector we use a self-correlation
procedure to calculate allometric vector repeatability
[6,23]. Allometric vector repeatability was estimated by
correlating the observed PC1 and each of the 100 PC1
obtained from a bootstrap sample of replicates. These correlations provide a distribution of self-correlation [4]. The
mean of this distribution is then used to measure allometry vector repeatability. To help judging how high allometric vector correlations are among genera and sex we
adjust the observed vector correlations for estimation

error by dividing the observed correlation by the square
root of the product of the two vector repeatabilities (see
[6,23]). I also use the strategy described by ([41], chapter
13, page 337) and compare each allometric vector to 100
random permutation of its elements. The rational underlying this approach is that if two vectors are "size" or "allometric" vectors with all elements positive, the range of
vectors correlations is actually much smaller that from
zero to one. Therefore every vector is permuted a 100
times and correlated with this random sample in order to
test, using the corresponding average and confidence
interval, whether or not correlation among any two vectors are indeed more similar that expected by chance
alone.
I also used another strategy to analyze the relationship
between size, shape and development based on [31]
restriction of the term heterochrony and his focus on
growth trajectories. Under this restriction heterochrony is
a uniform change in the rate or timing of some ontogenetic process, with no change in the nature of the biological interactions going on within that process [31].
Uniform changes in the growth trajectory (trait × time)
can be detected by comparing them (see Fig. 4 in [31]).
One caveat in the analyzes performed here is that neither
the Saimiri or Cebus data have time (age) available, given
that the specimens were wild caught. Therefore, I plotted
all 39 traits against skull size (all data ln-transformed in

order to linearize the relationship), assuming that size is
good proxy to time (see results for an indirect test of this
assumption). To help visualize whether or not trajectories
were linear and similar every plot included a LOWESS
smooth function with tension equal to 0.3 (SYSTAT 11,
Richmond, CA). The smoothing is produced by running
along the X values and finding predicted values from a
weighted average of nearby Y values. The surface is
allowed to flex locally to better fit the data.
Given variation in squirrel and capuchin monkey size
and, consequently, in allometric shape variation associ-

ated with those size differences, a normalization technique to scale data and remove allometric effects was
applied [20,24]. This method, which I will refer from now
on as "Multivariate Allometric Size-Scaling (MASS)", is
derived from theoretical equations of allometric growth
removing all the information related to size, not only scaling all individuals to the same size, but also adjusting
their shape to account for allometry [20]. Here I follow
Marroig and [24] modifying the [20] method by using the
first principal component (PC1) score of the natural log
data as the overall size measure and regressing all 39 traits
onto PC1. The [20] correction is
Y*i = Yi [X0/Xi]b
Where Yi and Xi are the values of a specific trait and overall
size (PC1 score) in individual 'i', respectively, Y*i is the
theoretical value for the trait at the average size, X0 is the
average antiloge of the PC1 scores, and 'b' is the PC1 coefficient for each of the 39 traits. Notice that 'b' is equal to
the regression coefficient of the trait Y upon the PC1
scores. After this correction, the original data of all Cebinae are scaled to the same size, also adjusting their shapes
for allometric scaling. These scale-corrected data were
used to explore whether differences among Saimiri and
Cebus were size dependent. This was done comparing the
results of the MANOVA using the original (unscaled) and
scale-corrected (MASS) data.
Geometric morphometrics
I also used a different approach to help visualize and test
for differences in size and shape among Cebus and Saimiri.
This geometric morphometrics approach was implemented using Morphologika, software developed by Paul
O'Higgins and Nicholas Jones (University of York, see
[27,7]). Detailed descriptions of Morphologika and the
geometric Morphometrics theory can be found elsewhere
[17,7,27,41]. The program uses generalized least squares
superimposition to register landmark data. Registration is
the basic procedure of translation, scaling, and rotation to
remove all information unrelated to shape [41]. The
resulting shape coordinates were subject to principal component analysis (PC's 3D from now on) in the tangent
space (the Procrustes tangent projection) to Kendall's
shape space [17,7]. What is important here is that this
approach allows the separation of absolute size (scale differences quantified by the centroid size), shape differences
due to allometry, and shape differences non-associated
with size. A sample of 279 skulls was used in this analyses
corresponding to all sub-adults and juveniles skulls and
adults of the two most abundant species of each genus.
Principal component scores were saved and used to test
for differences as well as to interpret biologically each PC.
One interesting feature in Morphologika is that the software allows the visualisation of the shape variability represented by the PCs which is achieved by reconstruction of

the skulls (landmarks) in real time at any point along each
PC axis.
The clear cut results in terms of separation and similarity
between ontogenetic and evolutionary allometries (see
below) arising from this geometric morphometric analysis, presents a new opportunity to develop a new
approach to the study of allometry, growth and development. Landmarks configurations were obtained for each
genus and age class along the PC1-3D and PC2-3D. The
absolute differences between each of those average configurations represent the amount of changes occurring in
each landmark along any period of the ontogeny. This
allows a quantification of the magnitude of changes in
each landmark throughout the ontogeny. Also, each of
these differences between age classes defines a vector of
changes in landmark position. Therefore is possible to
quantify and compare those changes in shape using again

vector correlation. These were calculated within each
genus for consecutive age classes (age1-age2 × age2-age3,
age2-age3 × age3-age4, and so on) as well as for similar
age classes between genera (Saimiri age1-age2 × Cebus
age1-age2, and so on). For those landmarks collected on
both sides of the skull, the average of absolute magnitude
of change was used in defining each vector. Therefore,
each vector has 22 elements.
Life-history
I also obtained life-history data from the literature
[15,11,9,19,28,37] for all New World Monkeys. Particularly, data on gestation length, body weight and skull size
(my own observations from museum specimens, both
skulls and labels), age at first reproduction, age at weaning, and birth weight, all transformed to natural log scale
to make their relationships linear. Fetal growth rate was
estimated by dividing the natural log of birth weight by

Page 24 of 26

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:20

the natural log of gestation length. Post-natal growth rate
was estimated by regressing the natural log of adult weight
by the natural log of the age of first reproduction (in days)
and using the regression slope as an estimate of the rate
(Table 8 show the life-history data). Association among
these variables was tested using the independent contrasts
(IC) method to account for the non-independence of phylogenetically structured data [12]. I use the module PDAP
[12] within the MESQUITE package [21] to obtain the correlation among variables. The phylogenetic tree used is
the same as in [25] based on [35]. Ideally, given that species within genus could vary in their life-histories, it
would be necessary to correct for such differences properly
accounting for phylogenetic relationships among species.
Unfortunately robust and complete (with all species) phylogenetic hypotheses at the species within-genus level are
not available for either Cebus or Saimiri. Also, not all species had life-history data available. These two pieces of
information would be necessary to estimate ancestor values for the life-history traits. Therefore, in order to at least
consider the range of variation in life-history among species within these two genera and check whether or not
results from these analyses are consistent I use the minimum and maximum values for each life-history parameter to test the robustness of these regressions.
