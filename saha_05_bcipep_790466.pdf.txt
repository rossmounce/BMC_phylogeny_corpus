Abstract
Background: Bcipep is a database of experimentally determined linear B-cell epitopes of varying
immunogenicity collected from literature and other publicly available databases.
Results: The current version of Bcipep database contains 3031 entries that include 763
immunodominant, 1797 immunogenic and 471 null-immunogenic epitopes. It covers a wide range
of pathogenic organisms like viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. The database provides a set of
tools for the analysis and extraction of data that includes keyword search, peptide mapping and
BLAST search. It also provides hyperlinks to various databases such as GenBank, PDB, SWISSPROT and MHCBN.
Conclusion: A comprehensive database of B-cell epitopes called Bcipep has been developed that
covers information on epitopes from a wide range of pathogens. The Bcipep will be source of
information for investigators involved in peptide-based vaccine design, disease diagnosis and
research in allergy. It should also be a promising data source for the development and evaluation
of methods for prediction of B-cell epitopes. The database is available at http://www.imtech.res.in/
raghava/bcipep.

Background
The antigenic regions of protein recognized by the binding sites of immunoglobulin molecules are called B-cell
epitopes [1]. These epitopes can be classified into two categories; i) conformational/discontinuous epitope, where
residues are distantly separated in the sequence and
brought into physical proximity by protein folding and,
ii) linear/continuous epitope, comprised of a single continuous stretch of amino acids within a protein sequence
that can react with anti-protein antibodies [2,3]. Most of
the B-cell epitopes were thought to be discontinuous.
However, in late 1980s it was shown that this conformational restriction is not a necessary condition for the production of protein-reactive anti-peptide antibodies [4].
The designing of the conformational epitopes is difficult

and so experimental B-cell epitopes largely include linear
epitopes. These linear epitopes can be exploited in the
development of synthetic vaccines and disease diagnosis.
A number of vaccines based on B-cell epitopes are currently under clinical phase trials against viruses [5], bacteria [6] and cancer [7]. These epitopes are also important
for allergy research and in determining cross-reactivity of
IgE-type epitopes of allergens [8].
A large number of B-cell epitopes have been reported in
the literature in last two decades. There is a need to collect
and compile these epitopes to evaluate the performance
of existing B-cell epitope prediction methods and to further develop better methods [9,10]. We have observed
that the performance of the existing physico-chemical

scales is not very high [11]. Recently, Blythe and Flower
examined 484 amino acid propensity scales in predicting
of B-cell epitopes and found that even the best set of scales
and parameters performed only marginally better than
random [12]. The evaluation of the existing scales indicates that there is a need to develop better methods by
using artificial intelligence techniques. The collection of
B-cell epitopes should help in deriving new scales for
accurate in silico prediction of linear epitopes. Also it will
help the immunologist to understand the complex nature
of immunogenic peptides and for the development of vaccines. There are many databases available on T-cell
epitopes [13-15]. In contrast, there are limited number of
databases on B-cell epitope for example JenPep [16,17]
and HIVDB [18]. Recently, JenPep has been superseded by
AntiJen 2.0, which has included peptides bound to MHC
ligand, TCR-MHC Complexes, T cell epitope, TAP, B cell
epitope molecules and immunological protein-protein
interactions. AntiJen also contains peptide library, copy
numbers and diffusion coefficient data. Though AntiJen
provides information about different types of peptides
(>24000 entries) from a single source but it provides limited information about B-cell epitopes and tools to analyze and retrieve the data. Recently, we have created a
comprehensive database, Bcipep, of B-cell epitopes. Latest
version of Bcipep contains 3031 entries, where each entry
provides detailed description of a B-cell epitope. Currently, we have covered only the continuous B-cell
epitopes. The aim of this database is to assist the scientific
community working in the areas of synthetic peptide vaccines (based on B-cell epitopes) and allergy research. The
database will complement the existing databases such as
AntiJen [16,17].
Availability
The database is available at http://www.imtech.res.in/

PEP (SRS version).

Database construction
The PostgreSQL relational database management system
(RDBMS) has been used for storing, retrieval and managing the data. The scripts, which provide interface between
user and database, were written in PERL, CGIPerl and
Pgperl. B-cell epitopes were collected from the literature
(PubMed, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/; ScienceDirect, http://www.sciencedirect.com/). A large number
of HIV epitopes were extracted from a book [18].

Database description
The aim of Bcipep database is to provide; i) comprehensive information about B-cell epitopes, ii) tools for extraction and analysis of this information and, iii) hyperlinks

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/79

to related databases. The overall architecture of Bcipep
database is shown in Figure 1.

Database information
General
This database provides compehensive information about
the linear B-cell epitopes which includes; i) amino acid
sequence of epitope, ii) source protein from which
epitopes were obtained, iii) experimental methods used
in accessing the immunogenic potential of epitopes, iv)
pathogen group (e.g., bacteria, virus, fungi, protozoa) of
source protein and, v) miscellaneous information in the
'Comment' field.
Immunogenicity and model organisms
The immunogenicity of a peptide is a semi-quantitative
measure of its immunogenic potency. In Bcipep it is
divided into three categories; i) immunodominant, if it
increases 2–3 folds anti-peptide antibodies in comparison
to reference or control (carrier protein, eg., BSA or KLH),
ii) immunogenic, if it enhances anti-peptide antibodies
by one-fold in comparison to reference, and iii) nullimmunonogenic, where no difference was observed when
compared to reference. This information is very important
for developing B-cell epitope prediction method. The
database also provides information about 'Model organism' used for immunization.
Antibodies and neutralization
The database provides full information about monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies produced against an
epitope. The information includes, isotypes of immunoglobin and name/number of monoclonal antibodies.
The database also contains information about neutralization potential of anti-peptide antibody, which is crucial
for considering a peptide for synthetic vaccine design.
Links to databases
The Bcipep provides hyperlinks to various sequence databases in order to provide detailed information about peptides in database. The 'database reference' field consists
name/code of protein available in SWISS-PROT [19]. The
'Antigenic structure' field consists of PDB codes [20] of protein structures having matching peptides. These PDB
codes are linked to OCA browser http://pdb.tau.ac.il/ in
order to provide detailed structure information of these
proteins. It also provides structure information about 242
antibodies, where each antibody is hyperlinked to PDB
database through the OCA browser. The 'Publication reference' field provides full information about related publications with link to PUBMED [21]. Bcipep is also linked to
MHCBN database [15] in order to identify the peptides
that are B-cell as well as T-cell epitopes.

Web tools
Bcipep has following major web-based tools for retrieval
and analysis of information in Bcipep database (Figure 1).
These web tools have been designed to facilitate the user
in retrieving information from database.
Keyword search
This option allows users to perform search on all fields of
the database ('Peptide Sequence', 'Source Protein', 'Publication Reference', 'Database Reference'). One can restrict the
keyword search on any specific field. It also allows users
to select the fields to be displayed. An example of keyword
search is shown in Figure 2a, where key word 'P26694' is
searched in any filed of database. The output/result of this
keyword search is shown in Figure 2b.

Peptide search
The database provides option to search a peptide in Bcipep. The tool will display full information about the peptides included in Bcipep. The server also permits users to
search their query sequence in any pathogen group.
Search can be restricted on the basis of immunogencity
that is immunodominant, immunogenic or null-immunogenic. An example of input and output of peptide
search is shown in Figures 3a and 3b respectively.
Mapping of T-cell epitopes
This server allows searching of peptide in Bcipep against
MHCBN database. The MHCBN database provides information about components of cell-mediated immunity
like MHC binders/non-binders, T-cell epitopes and TAP

binders [14]. The peptides related to cell-mediated
immunity can be mapped on resultant B-cell epitopes
obtained from keyword/peptide search by clicking on
'Peptide Sequence' field (Figures 2b and 3b). Thus, the
server is useful in identifying the potential B-cell epitopes
having T-cell epitopes (or MHC binders). The example of
mapping of MHCBN peptides on B-cell epitope (by clicking on peptides sequence field of Figure 3b) is shown in
Figure 4a. The full information of each map peptide can
be obtained by clicking on the mapped sequence. One
such example is shown in Figure 4a and 4b. The mapping
allows user to detect the regions in B-cell epitope having
promiscuous MHC binders (peptides that can bind to
large number of MHC alleles) or T-cell epitopes.
Peptide mapping
The peptides of Bcipep can be mapped on query sequence
using this option. The full information about mapped
peptide can be obtained by clicking on it. The tool will
assist the researchers in gaining knowledge about the
known immunogenic or non-immunogenic regions in

target protein of interest. The example input and output of
peptide mapping is shown in Figures 5a and 5b respectively. The users can specify the pathogen group and/or
immunogenicity level of peptides to be mapped on query
sequence. As shown in Figure 5b, the graphical mapping
of peptides/epitopes on query allows one to easily detect
the regions that bind to large number of B-cell peptides.
BLAST search
This tool allows users to search their query protein against
antigenic proteins maintained at Bcipep. The sequence of
1070 antigenic proteins has been obtained from SWISSPROT. The similarity search is performed using the
GWBLAST server http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/
gwblast/. The GWBLAST also allows users to analyze the
BLAST output like multiple alignments, phylogenetic
analysis.

Online data submission
The database has the facility to submit data to Bcipep online via Internet. Users can submit information about

their experimentally determined B-cell epitopes. We hope
that immunologists will submit their information on Bcell epitope in Bcipep, similar to the sequence data at GenBank and SWISS-PROT. The Bcipep team will add more
data from literature to maintain B-cell data up-to-date and
cross check the data submitted by users to maintain quality of the data.

Potential utility and limitations
One of the major challenges in the field of subunit vaccine
design is to identify the antigenic regions (B and T cell
epitopes) that can generate antigen specific memory cells.
Thus, the identification of regions/stretches on an antigen
from the data pool of known epitopes is an important
step in vaccine design. The Bcipep database would be very
useful as it consists of comprehensive information about
experimentally verified linear B-cell epitopes and tools for
mapping these epitopes on an antigen sequence. In case
query antigen contains known epitopes, this database
might aid in the wet experimentation and lower the cost
by reducing the overlapping repeats. This strategy is frequently used for the screening of transgenic proteins by
searching linear IgE-binding epitopes [22]. Unlike discontinuous epitopes, the linear epitopes are easy to design, as
they do not require tertiary structure information. Bcipep
also provides information on neutralizing B-cell epitopes
where an antibody generated against a B-cell epitope neutralizes the parent antigen. The current version of Bcipep
provides neutralizing information on about 1309 such Bcell epitopes. This information is very important for
selecting functional B-cell epitopes. This database also
provides a link with MHCBN to search for overlapping
regions of MHC binders and T-cell epitopes in the B-cell
epitopes. Thus, the user can identify both antigenic

regions that can activate B-cell and T-cell, which can lead
to the development of better vaccine. The epitopes in Bcipep can be used to derive the rules for predicting B-cell
epitopes.
The aim of designing synthetic linear peptides as epitopevaccine is to induce neutralizing antibodies against the
pathogen [23]. There are many reports that the linear Bcell epitopes were characterized as neutralizing antibodies
as in Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A (Btx
A)[24]. In Bcipep, there are 748 neutralizing anti-peptide
antibodies entries. However, in some cases these linear
epitope(s) fail to produce neutralizing antibodies and do
not give protective immunity. For instance, it has been
shown in the past that the antibodies against the synthetic
peptides and short recombinant proteins of approximately 100 amino acids of hepatitis E virus (HEV) do not
neutralize, suggesting that the HEV neutralization
epitope(s) is conformation dependent [25]. The elicitation of a bactericidal and protective immune response to
Borrelia burgdoferi decorin binding protein requires a
properly folded conformation for the production of functional antibodies [26]. Recently, Corcoran et al, 2004,
observed that B-cell memory is established and maintained against conformational epitopes of Parvovirus VP2
and against linear epitopes of VP1 but not against linear
epitope VP2 [27]. Thus, it is not necessary that the linear
B-cell epitope will always give rise to memory cells. One
should also check the neutralizing information of Bepitopes, as only 748 B-cell epitopes out of 1309 in Bcipep were able to neutralize the parent protein.
For an effective use of Bcipep, it is important to understand the limitation of linear B-cell epitopes and data in

Bcipep. The few limitations of current version of Bcipep
are; i) it does not cover discontinuous epitopes, ii) it has
limited number of unique peptides (1590) in 3031
entries and, iii) it contains peptides having only natural
amino acids. One should be careful in using linear B-cell
epitopes in developing epitope based subunit vaccine.
The organism used for immunization (information
included in the database) should also be taken into consideration, since immune response is T-helper cell (MHCII-peptide complex) dependant and B-cell epitope alone
may not generate protective antibodies [28]. In some
cases, the nature of the adjuvant used and the route of
immunization (information not included in the database) might also play important roles in the induction of
protective anti-peptide antibody response against the
pathogen [29-31].
