Abstract
Background: During the last decade, numerous microsatellite markers were developed for genotyping and to identify
closely related plant genotypes. In citrus, previously developed microsatellite markers were arisen from genomic libraries
and more often located in non coding DNA sequences. To optimize the use of these EST-SSRs as genetic markers in
genome mapping programs and citrus systematic analysis, we have investigated their polymorphism related to the type
(di or trinucleotide) or their position in the coding sequences.
Results: Among 11000 unigenes from a Clementine EST library, we have found at least one microsatellite sequence
(repeated units size ranged from 2 to 6 nucleotides) in 1500 unigenes (13.6%). More than 95% of these SSRs were di or
trinucleotides. If trinucleotide microsatellites were encountered trough all part of EST sequences, dinucleotide
microsatellites were preferentially (50%) concentrated in the 5' 100th nucleotides. We assessed the polymorphism of 41
EST-SSR, by PCR amplification droved with flanking primers among ten Citrus species plus 3 from other genera. More
than 90% of EST-SSR markers were polymorphic. Furthermore, dinucleotide microsatellite markers were more
polymorphic than trinucleotide ones, probably related to their distribution that was more often located in the 5'
UnTranslated Region (UTR). We obtained a good agreement of diversity relationships between the citrus species and
relatives assessed with EST-SSR markers with the established taxonomy and phylogeny. To end, the heterozygosity of
each genotype and all dual combinations were studied to evaluate the percentage of mappable markers. Higher values (>
45%) were observed for putative Citrus inter-specific hybrids (lime lemon, or sour orange) than for Citrus basic true
species (mandarin, pummelo and citron) (<30%). Most favorable combinations for genome mapping were observed in
those involving interspecific hybrid genotypes. Those gave higher levels of mappable markers (>70%) with a significant
proportion suitable for synteny analysis.
Conclusion: Fourty one new EST-SSR markers were produced and were available for citrus genetic studies. Whatever
the position of the SSR in the ESTs the EST-SSR markers we developed are powerful to investigate genetic diversity and
genome mapping in citrus.

Background
Simple Sequence Repeats are tandem repeat sequences
that are quite abundant in eukaryotes genomes [1].
Numerous genomic libraries enriched in SSR have been
established from many plant species [2-5]. Those repeat
sequences also called microsatellites (MS) present a
higher level of polymorphism and higher expected heterozygosity when compared with to other dominant (AFLP
and RAPD) or codominant markers (RFLP) [6]. Since SSRs
are ubiquitously present in genomes with randomly
occurrence, they are communally used as genetic markers
in many different plant species to unravel the interspecific
and intraspecific diversity [7-10].
In citrus, the number of published markers of genomic
SSRs is still limited [11,12]. Those markers were used for
genetic diversity assessment and for germplasm management [13,14]. A high-density microsatellite consensus
map is still lacking. The major goal of genetic mapping is
to localize genes or QTLs, involved in traits of interest that
are linked to molecular markers. Those molecular markers
can be used as a starting point for gene identification or to
reduce schemes of selection. One other way to address
this aim is to develop markers directly localized in the
coding sequences. ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags)
derived from cDNA libraries obtained from the genome
expression have been investigated for microsatellite
screening, in barley [15], wheat [16], rice [17], citrus
[18,19], sugarcane [20] and grape [21]. It is assumed that
those SSRs markers should enable to assess the molecular
evolution of the genes in which they are positioned.
Indeed, it has been observed that in ESTs, the flanking
region of SSRs are more conserved and can also be found
in related genera [22]. Thousands of EST-SSRs were identified in numerous species such as grape and cereal. A high
level of transferability was noted between rice, wheat and
barley [17]. In citrus, thousands of ESTs are now available
in databases. Recently, using public sequence databases
resources, Chen et al. [23], published the characterization
of 56 EST-SSR markers identified among 2295 citrus ESTs,
mappable in a progeny obtained from a cross between
sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osb.) and trifoliate orange
(Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.). If those two genotypes represent important resources of agronomical characters for
rootstock and cultivar improvement scheme, numerous
other citrus species offer a large panel of specific traits
interesting breeders or consumers. For example, Clementine (Citrus clementina Hort. Ex Tan.) is a model citrus crop
in Mediterranean area and sour orange (C. aurantium L.)
or Cleopatra mandarin (C. reshni Hort. Ex Tan.) are tolerant to abiotic constraints such as salt stress or calcareous
soils [24]. Citrus as many fruit trees have a juvenility
period with around 5 years of duration limiting the possibility to study the allelic segregation on a second generation of hybrids (F2 or BC). Consequently citrus genetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/287

maps are established on F1 progenies at interspecific [25],
and intergeneric levels [26-31]. To maximize the potential
for the development of EST-SSR based maps we need to
investigate the polymorphism and the heterozygosity of
these markers in different combined genotypes at the origin of F1 progenies. Another point of reflexion concerning
the polymorphism of SSRs in EST is the usefulness of the
derived markers such as STMS (Sequence Tagged MicroSatellite) in cultivar distinctness and in relationships
between varieties and species. The particular position of
these SSRs inside coding sequences may question the
genetic diversity information that we can extract from
those markers related to the putative influence of the
selection on the SSR polymorphism.
In a full-length clementine (Citrus clementina) ESTs database [19], we looked for SSR markers. Screening of 37 000
ESTs allowed us to identify about 1600 SSRs. We report
here the outline investigation of the polymorphism of
EST-SSR among a set of 16 citrus species covering a wide
range of citrus genetic diversity. We assessed also the mappability of these markers on our different progenies established for heredity studies. The effect of repeated motif
length (dinucleotide or trinucleotide) and their position
on the cDNA sequence, on their polymorphism are also
discussed.

Methods
SSR detection
SSR detection was undertaken on 11632 non-redundant
sequences generated by the StackPACK application
homepage [32] from 37 000 ESTs obtained from Nules
clementine. The MIcroSAtellite identification tool (MISA)
[33] was used to perform the search of 2 to 6 nucleotide
motif repeats into the unigene dataset. Dinucleotide SSRs
were identified with a minimum of six repeats and the
other types of SSR with a minimum of five repeats. The
maximum interruption between 2 SSRs to consider a SSR
as a compound one was set at 100 nucleotides. Perl script
modules linked to the primer modelling software Primer3
[34], were used to design primers flanking each SSR region
found. The primer product size range was chosen between
100 and 280 nucleotides. The optimum size of primers
was set to 17 nucleotides (range from 15 to 23 nucleotides) with an optimum melting temperature of 56.0°C
(range from 50 to 63°C). When possible, 3 pairs of primers were picked for each STMS. The localization of SSRs in
comparison with the coding sequence was estimated by
BLASTx analysis realised during initiation of the Clementine EST Database (ESTtik, CIRAD, Montpellier, France)
for assessing putative function to the unigene sequence.
The codon sequences were translated in nucleotide
sequences and then the SSR position related to the CDS
was elucidate and detailed as following: in 5'UTR, in CDS
or in 3'UTR.

Plant material
Sixteen citrus genotypes were investigated for microsatellite screening. Thirteen varieties from 10 species were chosen to represent the Citrus genus (Table 1). One accession
of the two other true citrus genera, Fortunella marumi and
Poncirus trifoliate and a related wild genus, Severinia buxifolia, completed the citrus sample set. All those accessions
are maintained in the INRA CIRAD citrus depository at
San Giuliano (Corsica, France).
EST functional annotation
Functional annotation of ESTs was based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotation [35], and performed of with
BLAST2GO [36]. B2G parameters were: NCBI non-redundant DB for BLAST search, 20 hits maximum for BLAST
result, 100 nt as minimum HSP-length to retain putative
annotating hits and default Evidence Code Weights for
Gene Ontology annotation that assigns high ECWs to
experimental-based and curate annotations while penalized electronic and non-curate annotations. Minimum
values for BLAST e-value and % similarity of the BLAST
result were e-06 and 55% respectively and ultimate annotation cut-off value was set to 55.

To provide a broad representation of the distribution of
gene product functions, the ESTs were organized in sets
according to broad GO ontology categories, as described
by the GO Slim Classification for Plants developed at
TAIR. GOSlim annotations of the Citrus ESTs were also
generated with the B2G software, using the plant GOSlim
mapping tool provided in TAIR. The GO Slim classification was performed for both the whole collection of 37
000 ESTs and the subset of sequences carrying SSRs.

SSR polymorphism analysis
Total DNA was extracted from leaf samples according to
the method developed by Doyle and Doyle [37]. Amplifications were performed according to Kijas et al. [11] in a
thermocycler (PTC 200, MJ Research) using 10 ng of
DNA, 0.5 μM of each primer and 0.8 unit of Taq polymerase (Goldstar, Eurogentec). The annealing temperature
was fixed for all primer pairs at 55°C (this condition was
taking account during the primer designing). Separation
of alleles was performed on a 6% polyacrylamide
sequencing gel containing 7 M urea in 0.5× TBE buffer at
60 W for 2 h to 3 h. Three microliters of PCR product was
mixed to an equal volume of loading buffer containing
95% formamide, 0.25% bromophenol blue and 0.25%
xylen cyanol, and 10 mM of EDTA. This mixture was
heated for 5 min at 94°C to denature the DNA before
loading. Gels were stained with silver nitrate following the
protocol detailed by Chalhoub et al. [38], for gel electrophoresis analysis and by comparison with the 10 bp DNA
standard ladder (Invitrogen).
Genetic diversity and data analysis
Four parameters of diversity were estimated for each locus
corresponding to a subset of 39 SSR markers: percentage
of polymorphic loci, the mean number of alleles per
locus, observed heterozygosity (H0), and the identifica-

tion rate (IR). H0 was estimated for each type of EST-SSR
marker. IR represents the degree of polymorphism of each
marker suitable for genotype distinctness and was calcun

lated as 1 ∑ Pi where Pi is the rate of identified genon
i =1

types across all individuals at i locus and n is the number
of observed loci. The value of IR varies between 1 (all the
individuals are distinct at all loci) and 0 (all individuals

have a same molecular profile at any locus). An ANOVA
was applied as statistical analysis to test the effect of the
SSR features on diversity parameters.
To determine the genetic diversity structure and relationships between species we scored the SSR profile at 41 loci
for each citrus sample by coding the presence (1) and the
absence (0) of each allele. Genetic distance between each
citrus genotype was estimated by calculating the Dice dissimilarity index [39]. A dendrogram was constructed with
the Neighbour joining method [40]. This analysis was performed with the "DARwin" software developed by CIRAD
(Montpellier, France). We have calculated the percentage
of heterozygous loci of each of the 15 genotypes (Severinia
buxifolia was not included in this analysis) and also the
percentage of polymorphic and monomorphic heterozygous loci between each pair of genotypes. The percentage of mappable loci in each hypothetical genotype
association was estimated by the addition of the rate of
heterozygous loci from two parents and avoiding to taking account twice the commune markers.

Results
EST-SSRs frequency and GO representation
1692 SSRs (excepted mononucleotide unit) were identified among 11 391 unigenes from 37 000 EST clones. We
first analyzed the type nucleotide repetition in the SSRs.
Some unigenes contained more than one microsatellite
sequences and at the end, 1501 unigenes (13%) had at
least one SSR. Functional characterization of ESTs was performed assigning Gene Ontology annotations [35], with
the BLAST2GO software [36]. To provide a general representation of the annotation, the Slim GO Classification
was obtained (see Materials and Methods), for both the
whole set of ESTs and the subset displaying SSRs. ESTs
with SSRs were present in every major Slim GO category,
and no significant differences could be found with respect
the whole EST collection (Fig. 1).

The different SSRs found among our Clementine EST
library and their frequency were: the most common trinucleotide repeats (53.9%) followed by dinucleotide repeats
(37.6%), tetranucleotide repeats (3.7%), hexanucleotide
repeats (2.4%) compound repeats (2%) and the less
abundant pentanucleotide repeats (0.4%).

Distribution of di or trinucleotide SSRs on ESTs
The SSRs display preferential location along EST
sequences from clementine EST database [19] was, with a
high concentration of these before the 100th nucleotide
from the 5' extremity (75%). The analysis of the SSR type
showed a difference on distribution along the EST
sequence (Fig. 2). Dinucleotide microsatellites were
located preferentially at the beginning (5'part) of the
cDNA (50% of the total were located before the 100th
nucleotide) and in the UTR (75%). Trinucleotide SSRs
were less concentrated at the beginning of the 5' terminal
region of the cDNA sequence (25%) when compared to
dinucleotide SSRs. Microsatellites were localized either
inside, either outside the translated region (TR). Since the
absence of a stop codon in some cDNA sequences (the
sequencing was not complete in the 3' extremity), it
wasn't possible to detect any translated sequences or ORFs
(open reading frame) for the cDNA sequences corresponding to the EST-SSR markers N° 16, 21, 26, 34 and
43. For EST sequences where the TR was detected, dinucleotide SSRs were preferentially concentrated (75% of
them) in untranslated regions (UTR). Trinucleotide microsatellites were equitably distributed inside and outside
the TR of the ESTs (48% and 52% respectively).
Development of EST-SSR markers
A set of 48 pairs of primers was randomly chosen among
the 1692 microsatellites that matched with identified
genes sequences from nucleic acid data bases (EMBL or
NCBI) to amplify 23 dinucleotide SSRs and 25 trinucleotide SSRs. Among them, 7 did not amplify even clementine suggesting that the selected primers were not adapted
or that the PCR product was too large to be amplified. 41
primer pairs amplifying DNA fragment in Clementine
were presented in Table 2. In order to check the redun-

dancy or the novelty of those markers, we compared by
BLASTn the sequences of EST clones supporting the development of EST-SSR markers in clementine with those
published by Chen et al [23]. We have not detected any
similarity between both sets of markers. The amplified
DNA profile of EST-SSR markers N°115 and N°482 were
multi-bands suggesting genome duplications of corresponding genes or nonspecific PCR amplification. We
have also compared the expected size of DNA fragment
containing each SSR and flanked by primers (calculated
from the EST sequence), and the size of corresponding
amplified fragments from genomic DNA of Clementine
(estimated on gel electrophoresis) (Table 2). The observed
PCR product sizes were mainly equal to the expected ones
with differences minus than 10 nucleotides. These small
variations could be associated to errors during ESTs
sequencing or in size estimation on gel electrophoresis.
For 6 EST-SSR markers (N° 21, 25, 34, 203, 228 and 430)
variations were greater than 30 nucleotides with a maximum of 270 bases of increase of the DNA fragment size
for marker N°430. In those markers, we suspected the
presence of introns in the amplified DNA fragments.
The 39 single EST-SSR markers were used to amplify the
DNA of 16 genotypes representing a wide genetic variation of the Corsican citrus germplasm. Amplifications
were successful for all the citrus genotypes with all primer
pairs excepted for 3 markers which did not amplify any
DNA fragment for Box orange (Severinia buxifolia). This
genotype was considered to a member of the Citrinae subtribes as true citrus genera (Poncirus, Fortunella and Citrus).
Observed size variations in amplified DNA fragments
were always correlated to the size of the repeated sequence
unit of each SSR suggesting that the polymorphism was
only related to the difference of repetition number of SSR.
On the figure 3 is represented the polymorphism detected
with the trinucleic microsatellite marker N°164. Note that
the size differences between each DNA fragments were
equal or multiple of 3 (181/187 bases, 181/190 bases,
184/181 bases for respectively Nules clementine,
Morocco sour orange and Mexican lime). The sequencing
of these different SSR alleles confirmed that the size variation was due to the difference in the number of repeats
unit.
Position and SSR type effect on polymorphism
Polymorphism, number of allele per locus and number of
genotypes per locus for the 16 dinucleic and 23 trinucleic
SSRs when compared to their respective position on the
EST sequence (Table 3). Without any distinction about
the type of SSR we have observed an effect of the SSR position on the polymorphism. The polymorphism obtained
was greater when SSRs were in UTRs (86% versus 67%)
whatever the type of repeats. Considering only the type of

Polymorphism of the trinucleotide microsatellite (EST164 STMS) among citrus genotypes detected by silver
nitrate staining gel electrophoresis. Below the photography size allelic interpretation of each genotype is detailed. The
order of the sample is the following: Invitrogen 10 bp ladder (Lane M), 'Nules' clementine (lane 1), 'Washington Navel' sweet
orange (lane 2), 'Cleopatra' mandarin (lane 3), 'Willow leaf' mandarin (lane 4), 'Morocco' sour orange (lane 5), 'Marsh' grapefruit (lane 6), 'Corsican' citron (lane 7), 'Mexican' lime (lane 8), 'Brazil sweet' lime (lane 9), 'Lisbon Foothill' lemon (lane 10),
'Sans pepin' pummelo (lane 11), 'Pink' pummelo (lane 12), 'Kindia' combava (lane 13), 'Rubidoux' trifoliate orange (lane 14),
'Marumi' kumquat (Lane 15).

repeated unit, differences were also observed. If the percentage of polymorphic loci was quite similar between trinucleic SSRs (83%) and dinucleic SSRs (80%), for the two
last indicators of marker diversity the effect of unit repeat
was significantly different. Dinucleic repeated units
revealed significant higher polymorphism than trinucleic
repeated units with 7.3 versus 4.1 alleles per locus (P =
0.015), and 0.61 versus 0.29 for the IR (P = 0.010). If we
combine parameters, type and position, differences were
particularly important for SSRs localized in UTR. In this
situation, dinucleic repeats had a number of alleles per
locus greater than trinucleic repeats (7.9 versus 4.4) and a
rate of identification 2 fold greater (0.66 versus 0.29). The
higher value of alleles per locus for dinucleic SSRs could

be related to the higher percentage of heterozygous loci
(54% versus 29% for trinucleic SSRs).
EST-SSR markers for genetic mapping
Heterozygosity of genotypes is a key component for
genetic mapping on F1 progenies classically used for citrus
genetic mapping. Based on a unique F1 progeny obtained
from a cross between two heterozygous genotypes it is
possible to develop a genetic map for each parent. Among
our genotypes it varies from 8% for citron to 58% for Brazil Sweet lime (Table 4). Excepted citron, the heterozygosity of other citrus genotypes is higher than 23%. In order
to estimate the rate of mappable EST-SSR markers in each
putative F1 progeny we have considered the percentage of

heterozygous loci, polymorphic and monomorphic
between two genotypes in all putative combinations
(Table 4). We have not considered Severinia buxifolia in
this table because it is sexually incompatible with other
true citrus varieties and so unsuitable for progeny creation
for genetic programs. Heterozygous loci polymorphic
between two genotypes could be used as anchored markers suitable for comparative genetic maps (sinteny).
Higher values were observed between highly heterozygous species like Morocco sour orange (45%) and
Marsh grapefruit (43%) with 29% of loci usable for comparative mapping. At the opposite, whatever the combined genotype, very few loci (less 10%) were available
for sinteny in all combinations involving citron that is the
less heterozygous citrus specie. In general, combinations
including interspecific hybrids such as limes, lemon,
grapefruit, orange, and sour orange gave the highest percentage of EST-SSR markers suitable for sinteny (>20%).
Kindia combava which is wild citrus specie is heterozygous as interspecific hybrids (43%) and is also characterized by high percentage of suitable markers for sinteny
whatever the parental partner excepted with Corsican citron and Pink pummelo. We have estimated also the percentage of monomorphic heterozygous loci (upper part of
the table 4). If the allelic segregation could be expected in
these loci, the parental origin for inherited allele could not
be assigned and then the information related to meiosis in
both genotypes is lost. These markers were usually
included in segregation data set for genetic map construction from F1 progeny, with the hypothesis of equal
recombination rate and normal segregation between male
and female genomes. In few combinations the percentage
of heterozygous and monomorphic loci is quite high for
instance for clementine/sweet orange (20%) or Brazil

sweet lime/lemon (21%). Nevertheless, excepted pairs
involving clementine and sweet orange combined with
Willow leaf mandarin, sour orange and grapefruit, the
percentage of heterozygous loci showing a same profile
between two genotypes was very low near zero.
Estimated percentages of mappable loci in each F1 progeny were presented in Table 5. The mean value of mappable loci calculated on the basis of all results was 57% for
this set of genotypes. In details, higher values were
observed for different combinations involving Brazil
sweet lime with different genotypes, as Marsh grapefruit
(80%), Valencia late sweet orange (78%) or Morocco sour
orange (77%). It is quite interesting to note that the combination of the two more heterozygous genotypes (Brazil
sweet lime and Lisbon lemon) produced a relatively low
percentage of mappable marker (65%) due to high level
of commune markers (21% of polymorphic plus 21% of
monomorphic). The less efficient combination was
observed for Corsican citron associated with Cleopatra
mandarin (29%) due to the high homozygous level of
these genotypes.
EST-SSR markers for genetic diversity analysis
In order to evaluate the ability of EST-SSR markers to be
used for systematic studies a cluster analysis of genetic
diversity was done combining polymorphism data of
dinucleic and trinucleic EST-SSR (Fig. 4). The sixteen genotypes were clearly differentiated and the relationships
between them were organized around two major groups,
clearly defined: The first group associated mandarins,
orange, sour orange, grapefruit and pummelo. The second
one was constituted mainly by the acidic species such as
lemon, limes, citron and combava. We can note that trifo-

Discussion
Frequency, distribution, and polymorphism
From the 11 391 unigenes obtained from 37 000 EST [19],
1692 microsatellite sequences were identified. 14% of
unigenes contain at list one microsatellite as already mentioned for other citrus resources by Chen et al. [23]. This

value can be considered as quite high by taking account of
the selection pressure that is applied on genes to maintain
a lower diversity on the coding region. Nevertheless this
frequency is higher than observed for dicotyledonous species ranged between 2.65% and 10.62% [41,42]. The frequency is dependent on the presence or not of
redundancy but also related to the parameters used for
SSRs screening in the database mining. Varshney et al [43]
reported that the frequency was about 5% when the minimum length for the detection of microsatellite was 20
nucleotides. In our study we were less drastic for the detection of SSR. We have fixed this criterion to a minimum of
6 repetitions for dinucleotide repeats (12 base pairs in
length) and 5 for the others (15 base pairs in length for trinucleotide). This difference could explain our higher frequency of SSRs in ESTs without apparently any effect on
polymorphism (see below). Trinucleotide and dinucleotide repeats were the most common SSRs in clementine
ESTs (53.9% and 37.6% respectively). These values reflect
the predominance of trinucleotide and dinucleotide
repeats in many EST plant species [23,42-46] meanwhile
a strong divergence was observed in a hexanucleotide
repeat frequency. In many crops they were abundant with
a frequency ranged between 13–26%. In clementine ESTs
they represent only 2.4% of overall SSRs.
Functional characterization of ESTs performed with GO
annotation showed that all the main functional categories
were represented. This is in agreement with previous
results [18,19]. The EST- SSRs showed similar distributions in the GO Slim categories, and no functional group
was overrepresented, indicating that there is no preference
in the location of microsatellites with respect to function
of the genes.
Relation between SSR polymorphism and phenotypic variation could be investigated in any MIPSs functional categories. Moreover, the EST-SSRs could represent a
convenient and cheap way for genes mapping when compared to RFLP technique and sequencing. Unfortunately,
the frequency of gene containing a SSR sequence is relatively low (14%). Moreover less than 66% of the analyzed
SSR were polymorphic. That means that less than 9%
(14% × 66%) of the unigenes should be mapped by internal SSR markers. Seven of the 47 couples of primers
amplified DNA fragments from clementine that were
larger than expected suggesting the presence of introns. It
is possible that the non amplification for the 9 other primers couples was also due to the presence of introns.
From the position analyze of SSRs in ESTs we founded
that the majority of SSRs were located in the UTR and
mostly (75%) in the first hundred bases of the 5' cDNA
extremity. This non equal distribution of SSRs along the
cDNA sequence was also reported in other crops such as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/287

rice, wheat and barley [17] but with some divergences. In
barley, the majority of SSRs are present in the EST 3'sequences with a high proportion of dimeric and tetrameric SSRs despite tetrameric SSRs are quite absent in
Clementine ESTs. As clementine EST clones were singlepass sequenced from their 5' end and their main size were
about 800 nucleotides [19], 3'end sequences of these ESTs
were certainly under represented. The EST 3' end region
was known to be also reached in microsatellites sequences
[44,45]. As a consequence of this method of EST production, we believe that we have introduced a bias in the general distribution of the different SSRs along the
clementine transcribed sequences. Nevertheless, few
works described the abnormally high frequency of microsatellite in 5'UTR regions of plant genes, and a lower
abundance in coding region or 3'UTRs [43,45]. Our
results seem to confirm this feature. This heterogeneous
distribution of SSRs could be explained by the incidence
of the SSR variability on the gene transcription and/or
proteins structure integrity and function. In UTR, these
microsatellites can be more variable without changing
gene transcription and translation. The dominance of
trimeric SSRs in TR can be explained by the suppression of
non-trimeric SSRs in coding regions due to the risk of
frame shift mutations that may occur when those microsatellites alternate in size of one unit. In the case of trimeric
repeats, it is worth to note that this kind of microsatellite
was distributed homogenously along ESTs. It could be
hypothesized that trinucleotide SSR variations has less
impact than dinucleotide variations in the gene functionality. Indeed, modification of the number of repeats of trinucleotide does not affect the reading frame.
Furthermore, dimeric SSRs seem to be more polymorphic
than trimeric ones and particularly in UTR with a putative
higher allelic diversity combined with higher heterozygosity contributing to a powerful capacity for distinctness.
These differences between repeated unit types were attenuated or disappeared when they were located in TR. However, the importance of this result has to be attenuated
since we do not have an equal representation for each situation and a too low sampled marker set. Unfortunately,
only 4 loci with di-SSRs in TR were detected when compared to 12 for trimeric SSRs and then the differences were
not statistically significant.
EST-SSR markers for citrus diversity
Genetic diversity analysis and systematic is a classical
application of SSR markers. For such application, the ability of one marker to differentiate germplasm accessions is
an important characteristic. Due to their higher polymorphism, markers localized in UTR are more interesting
than markers in TR. Moreover, better rate of accession
identification have been obtained with dinucleotide
markers (0.61) than with trinucleotide ones (0.29).

The organization of genetic diversity obtained with ESTSSR is in agreement with the knowledge of the genetic
relationships between Citrus species previously reported
by studies using different markers for systematic analyses:
morpho-physiological characters [47], biochemistry [48],
isozymes [49,50], genomic SSR markers [13,14], CAPS
markers [51], or RFLP and RAPD markers [52]. Three
major ancestral species: mandarins, pummelos and citrons are at the origin of many cultivated hybrids. As well,
the parental relation of limes and lemons with citrons was
clearly demonstrated by all these studies. It is in agreement with the strong differentiation we observed between
acidic citrus group (lime-lemon-citron) and the pummelo-mandarin (and their hybrids) group. Lemon is
thought to be a natural hybrid of a citron and a lime
[47,48], or a hybrid of citron and sour orange [51,53].
Our results seem to comfort the participation of sour
orange because 15 alleles specific from this genotype were
detected in lemon since 10 from citron and only 3 from
lime were observed. Nevertheless, we can not certify the
parental combination because in our sampling the lime
and citron groups were limited to a unique variety. The
diversity of these groups were not represented as described
previously [13,14] and so few alleles from lemon (4) were
still absent in the three putative parents of our study. Several hypotheses have also been proposed to explain the
origin of Mexican limes: hybrids of citrons and papedas
[48], tri-hybrid cross of citron, pummelo, and Microcitrus
[47] or hybrid between citron and C. micrantha [51]. As
for lemon the limited diversity of our analysis does not
allow to discuss these hypotheses. Sour orange is a natural
hybrid of a mandarin and a pummelo and in our analysis
it is associated to the pummelo cluster. The participation
of the two basic species, pummelo and mandarin, to the
sweet orange formation is attested by the citrus taxonomy
literature. However, some troubles still remain concerning the number of crosses between these two basic species.
Barkeley et al. [14] suggested that sweet orange was
derived from one or more backcrosses to the mandarin
and then its genetic was makeup derived from mandarin
and a small proportion from pummelo. Nicolosi et al.
[51] have proposed a single cross based on equal proportions of alleles from mandarin and pummelo. Our results,
with a common cluster of mandarin and sweet orange
support the first hypothesis where sweet orange has a
higher proportion of alleles from mandarin.
Compared to the phylogeny made with genomic SSR [14]
a single difference was observed in our representation. It
concerns the genetic diversity between citrus genera. The
trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) joins the cluster of citron-limes-lemon while kumquat (Fortunella japonica)
remains genetically distant to other citrus. In previous
work [14] about genetic relationships based on genomic
SSRs, the situation was inverted wherein Fortunella species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/287

were much more closely related to the four other Citrus
(mandarins, pummelos, citrons and papedas), and the
group of Poncirus accessions were very distant to all others.
This difference could be related by the overrepresentation
of kumquat diversity in our study or by a real difference of
polymorphism rate between genomic SSRs and EST-SSRs.
A similar study on a larger citrus sampling could be suitable to resolve this question. We can not compare the
transferability of EST-SSR and genomic SSRs, but a large
majority of EST-SSR markers could be used to investigate
the genetic of citrus relatives. Indeed, only 10% of those
EST-SSR markers gave unsuccessful amplification in Box
orange (Severinia buxifolia).
EST-SSR marker for citrus genome mapping
Citrus have a juvenility period with around 5 years of
duration limiting the possibility to work on a second generation of hybrids. Consequently a lot of citrus genetic
maps are established on F1 progenies at interspecific [25]
and intergeneric level [26-31]. In order to evaluate the
proportion of mappable EST-SSR markers we have calculated the percentage of heterozygous markers informative
for all combinations between 15 sexually compatible citrus genotypes, currently used or susceptible to be used in
citrus genetic programs. Table 4 represents a tool for the
selection of the sexual cross most suitable for a higher efficiency of mappable markers associated to the better situation for comparison of both parental maps. Higher
percentages of markers are available to map secondary
species of cultivated citrus than to establish genetic maps
of the three basic taxa (citron, mandarin, pummelo). As a
result, a very low rate of EST-SSR markers is usable to
make comparative genetic mapping between these three
basic taxa: it is only 3% for Citron/Pummelo, 3% for Citron/Mandarin (cv Cleopatra) and around 9% for Pummelo (cv Pink)/Mandarin (cv Cleopatra).

It is clear that the best way to map the higher number of
markers in a single progeny is to work on segregation of
interspecific or intergeneric crosses. Citrus × Poncirus progenies have been highly investigated [11,54-59]. A recent
work on EST genetic maps for Citrus sinensis and Poncirus
trifoliata was published [59]. For these maps the authors
have studied the segregation of 300 pairs of primers generating EST-SSR markers on the intergeneric progeny
sweet orange × trifoliate orange. Among them 141 markers (47%) were mapped and distributed as following: 122
markers (40.7%) on sweet orange map, 59 (19.7%) on trifoliate orange one and 40 (13.3%) were commune to
both. These values were very similar to those proposed in
our work (table 4 and 5) where for the same parental cross
we have estimated at 52% of of mappable EST-SSR markers and 40%, 29% and 17% respectively for orange, trifoliate orange maps and commune markers. This mapping
work was done with a majority of non abundant SSRs in

Page 11 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:287

ESTs such as compound, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeats. Di and tri-nucleotide SSRs represent only
26.7% of the total studied SSR markers.
On the base of the genetic differentiation observed in our
cluster analysis, it appears that in this frame, interesting
progenies should be obtained from F1 hybrids between
citron and pummelo, citron and mandarin, as well
between poncirus or kumquat with citron or mandarin or
pummelo. Such intrageneric progenies should probably
have more interest for further QTLs analysis of quality
traits.

Conclusion
We have observed a differential repartition of dinucleic
and trinucleic SSRs in the clementine ESTs with a high
concentration in UTR and more precisely in the 5'initial
region (but without a default of representation of 3'UTR
regions du to the strategy of EST sequencing). The degree
of SSR polymorphism is strongly modified by the utility
of coding regions. These two elements suggest that the
natural selection should limit the number and the polymorphism of SSRs in coding translated sequences. ESTSSRs are useful for enhancing individual species map, but
can be used as anchor probes for creating links between
maps in comparative studies. With the appropriate progeny arise from crosses between interspecific or intergeneric hybrids as parents, we can expect to use up to 80%
of the EST-SSR markers representing 9% of the global set
of genes from all the identified function groups. We suggest to focus on the dinucleotide SSRs localised in UTR
(more heterozygous and polymorphic) to increase the
efficiency of mapping loci and then to reduce the cost of
molecular marker screening between the parents of a
progeny. In addition to mapping ESTs via microsatellite
loci for locating putative functions, the EST-SSR markers
developed in this study are powerful for the study of
genetic diversity of citrus.
