Genetic isolation and morphological divergence
mediated by high-energy rapids in two cichlid
genera from the lower Congo rapids
Research article

Abstract
Background: It is hypothesized that one of the mechanisms promoting diversification in cichlid fishes in the African
Great Lakes has been the well-documented pattern of philopatry along shoreline habitats leading to high levels of
genetic isolation among populations. However lake habitats are not the only centers of cichlid biodiversity - certain
African rivers also contain large numbers of narrowly endemic species. Patterns of isolation and divergence in these
systems have tended to be overlooked and are not well understood.
Results: We examined genetic and morphological divergence among populations of two narrowly endemic cichlid
species, Teleogramma depressum and Lamprologus tigripictilis, from a 100 km stretch of the lower Congo River using
both nDNA microsatellites and mtDNA markers along with coordinate-based morphological techniques. In L.
tigripictilis, the strongest genetic break was concordant with measurable phenotypic divergence but no morphological
disjunction was detected for T. depressum despite significant differentiation at mtDNA and nDNA microsatellite
markers.
Conclusions: The genetic markers revealed patterns of philopatry and estimates of genetic isolation that are among
the highest reported for any African cichlid species over a comparable geographic scale. We hypothesize that the high
levels of philopatry observed are generated and maintained by the extreme hydrology of the lower Congo River.
Background
Population boundaries are largely determined by local
environment, the strength of barriers to migration, and
the organism's inherent dispersal abilities. The interaction among these and genetic factors determines the
potential for evolutionary divergence, and is at the heart
of our understanding of ecological adaptation and ongoing speciation processes. When individuals can easily
cross barriers between suitable habitat patches, gene flow
acts to homogenize most neutral genetic diversity and
may swamp the effects of any local phenotypic selection
whereas low levels of migration may facilitate ecological
divergence, even when selection is modest. Evolutionary
divergence through fine-scale geographic isolation is
believed to be one of the main mechanisms promoting
speciation in the cichlid radiations of the African Great

Lakes [1-3]. Many lake species are extreme local endemics, with distributions limited to small patches of ecologically distinct habitat. Many narrowly endemic cichlid
species are confined to rocky sections along the shores of
the lakes separated by stretches of sandy, muddy or
weedy shoreline or by deep channels [4]. In several cases,
molecular markers have shown that small patches of sand
or mud [5,6], intervening deep channels [7], and the
mouths of streams and rivers [8] are all noteworthy barriers to migration, and some species even show a pattern of
isolation by distance along continuous habitat [9]. Cichlid
philopatry in the African Great Lakes may augment the
effects of disruptive selection on phenotypic traits associated with mate choice and trophic adaptations believed to
be important in species divergence.
Comparatively little is known about the population
structure and extent of cichlid philopatry in river systems. In South American cichlids, Ready et al. [10,11],
have detected only modest levels of genetic divergence
along the Amazon River and a strong pattern of diver-

gence between drainages in the eastern Amazon basin in
two different cichlid genera but on a much larger geographic scale than has been observed in African lake
cichlids. Similarly, only a few published studies of African
river cichlids have focused on broad scale phylogeographic patterns. For example, Wu's study of the habitat
generalist Astatoreochromis alluaudi throughout the
Lake Victoria Basin found little population differentiation[12], whereas Hassanan and Gilbey [13] detected only
modest levels of differentiation among Oreochromis
niloticus populations separated by more than 100 km. In
the haplochromine genus Pseudocrenilabrus, Katongo et
al. [14] detected mtDNA haplotype and morphological
differences on broad geographic scales suggesting a pattern consistent with geographic speciation.
The proximate causes and adaptive significance of
cichlid philopatry have long been the subject of much
speculation. In the African Great Lakes, proposed advantages that may indirectly promote philopatry include
predator avoidance [15], microallopatric divergence [15],
and reduced mating success for immigrant males who
may lack the locally preferred phenotype [8]. The pattern
could also be a byproduct of extended brood care or male
territoriality (e.g. [16,17]).
While considerably less rich than the African Great
Lakes, the shoreline habitats of the Lower Congo River
(LCR) nonetheless harbor a large number of cichlid species, and to date 21 narrowly endemic species have been
reported from this short stretch of river. One of these,
Steatocranus mpozoensis, is known also to occur in the
Mpozo River, a large leftbank tributary of the LCR. Thoracochromis demeusii occurs predominantly in the main
channel but is also often found in lower reaches of
numerous affluent streams, while the remaining LCR
endemics are found exclusively in marginal habitats along
the river's main channel. Interestingly there are also parallels in habitat type between the Great Lakes and the
LCR system. The eddies along many sections of the LCR
shoreline encompass patches of rocky, sandy, muddy, and
weedy substrates that resemble the mosaics of habitat
types described in the African Great Lakes [4]. Unlike the
lacustrine setting, in large rivers, the presence of strong
currents might also influence both the distribution of and
connectivity among cichlid populations. In particular, the
complex hydrology of the LCR provides the potential for
additional barriers to inter-population migration that are
absent in lacustrine settings.
The Congo River drains approximately 3.8 million km2
section of equatorial Africa containing the largest continuous rainforest on the continent and a water volume that
is five times larger than that of the Mississippi River. Near
the twin cities of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of
Congo) and Brazzaville (Republic of Congo) the Congo
River spills over a rocky sill that forms the eastern bound-

ary of the LCR and plunges through a narrow gorge
descending some 280 m in its 350 km journey to the sea
[18]. The river gorge itself contains many width expansions and contractions and can be extraordinarily deep-recent in situ depth measurements record the channel to
be more than 200 m in some areas [19] forming the deepest river trenches and canyons in the world. This, combined with the high annual discharge, steep elevational
incline, fluctuating channel width and complex channel
topology creates an extremely energetic flow regime with
downstream water velocities in excess of 600 cm/s and
with vertical water velocities of up to 75 cm/second in
some sections [20].
The extreme hydrological conditions with persistent,
high in-stream water velocities in the LCR are expected
to hinder cross-channel passage and isolate small,
epibenthic cichlid populations to shorelines. Furthermore, because cichlids have physoclistous gas bladders,
adult fish have limited tolerance for rapid change in water
pressure [21], suggesting that few individuals would survive a rapid upward transport from depth through
entrainment in dynamic vertically upwelling waters. If
these complex and powerful river currents do reduce
gene flow this would then facilitate subsequent phenotypic divergence in isolation through natural selection,
sexual selection, or genetic drift.
Here we report the first detailed estimates of interpopulational connectivity and phenotypic divergence among
cichlids in a high energy African river. We selected two
locally endemic species with distinct ecologies from a 100
km stretch of the LCR (Figure 1-A). Teleogramma depressum, is a goby-like, benthic species that is confined to
rocky, shoreline habitats and which guard fixed territories
(Pers. Obs.). Teleogramma depressum appears to be
restricted in its geographical distribution to a region
approximately matching the present study reach. Lamprologus tigripictilis is a habitat generalist found over riffles and rocky habitats as well as over less complex
substrates where sand or mud predominate. They have
even been occasionally collected in flooded grasses, and
are considerably less territorial than T. depressum (Pers.
Obs.). The known distributional range of L. tigripictilis is
considerably larger than that of T. depressum, and extends
beyond the study reach from the region of Mbelo some
100 km downstream from Pool Malebo to Boma about 45
km downstream of Site E near Matadi.

als from the three upstream sites (Sites A, B, and C) and
those of the two downstream sites (Sites D and E). Hotelling's T2 indicates these differences are significant (F =
17.65, df = 40, 23, p < 0.001). A grid display of deformations implied by PC 1 scores using Procrustes superposition highlights regions of shape variation concentrated on
mouth size, paired fin placement, and body depth (Figure
2-B). In contrast, PCA results for T. depressum (Figure 2D, PC1 accounting for 42.9% and PC2 accounting for
17.5% of total variance, see also Figure 2-F) revealed no
clear relationship between shape variation and geographic location. Deformation implied by PC1 scores
using Procrustes superposition (Figure 2-E) indicates little variation among landmark configurations, and no significant differentiation between populations from Sites A
and B-C were detected (Hotelling's T2 F = 2.82, df = 34, 8,
p = 0.06).
Genetic Diversity

Sample sizes and genetic diversity summary statistics for
the nuclear loci can be found in Table 1. In T. depressum,
the observed 10 locus mean heterozygosity ranged from

0.36 in the sample from Site C to 0.42 at Sites A and B. All
loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after using a
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, however
one locus deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg
expectations at the p=0.05 level in samples from Sites B
and C. Population samples at Sites 2 and 3 were both
fixed for single alleles at Locus TmoM25 and at Locus
GM-125. L. tigripictilis populations showed a clear trend
of decreasing heterozygosity from upstream to downstream, with Hobs ranging from 0.62 at site A to 0.47 at
site E., and all loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Within site variation for mtDNA markers is shown in
Table 2. No clear upstream - downstream trend in
mtDNA diversity was detected.
The Bottleneck program detected no evidence of a
recent bottleneck in any of the populations in either species (Wilcoxan 1 tailed test of H deficiency: p = 0.78 for L.
tigripictilis, p = 0.24 for T. depressum).

between the samples from Site A relative to the samples
from Sites B and C. Individuals in populations A and B
differed by an average of 17 mtDNA base substitutions.

Similarly, our analysis of nuclear loci using the assignment test framework found the strongest support for two

were not statistically distinguishable from each other
within T. depressum.
The pattern of genetic differentiation was more complex among L. tigripictilis populations. The best-supported assignment test models for L. tigripictilis had
three distinct clusters (Figure 1C). Most individuals collected from sites D and E were united in a single cluster.
The ϕst estimate between samples from these two sites is
0.132 and is significantly different from zero (p = 0.004).
Individuals from Sites A and B belonged to two distinct
clusters, however these clusters were distributed between
two collection localities and the probabilities of assigning
individuals to one or the other cluster were often low. In
an attempt to 'force' these individuals to assign to one
cluster or another, a follow up Structure analysis was performed which initialized on the collection localities and
which did not allow admixture. However the results from
this subsequent analysis were similar to the initial analysis (results not shown). The estimated ϕst of 0.013
between L. tigripictilis samples from Sites A and B is
modest but statistically significant (p = 0.035). The most
dramatic difference in the data set was observed between
Site B and Site D, with a ϕst estimate of 0.216 (p = 0.001).
The structure results assigned individuals from Sites D
and E to a single genetic cluster. The ϕst estimate between
samples from these two sites is 0.132 and it is significantly
different from zero (p = 0.004). A similar pattern was
reflected in the mtDNA data set, with an average of 31
substitutions between individuals at Sites B and D, and
two distinct haplotype clusters separated by 25 substitutions (Figure 1-C and Table 2).
Isolation by distance analysis could not be conducted
on the T. depressum data set because only three geo-

graphic localities were successfully sampled. The data
were not consistent with a pattern of isolation by distance
among L. tigripictilis populations (r = 0.48, p = 0.12 for
untransformed data). A high level of gene flow between
populations A and B caused a deviation from the relationship expected under an IBD model.

Discussion
Evolutionary divergence is a continuous and dynamic
process in which landscape features may limit gene flow
between populations. When local ecological factors
select for distinct phenotypes in different and genetically
isolated populations, or when genetic drift causes different phenotypic traits to become fixed, this process may
lead to the development of reproductive isolation (speciation) between populations. Our data sets are the first
documentation of high levels of both genetic isolation
and phenotypic divergence owing to fine-scale philopatry
in cichlids in a high energy fluviatile setting. In both T.
depressum and L. tigripictilis we detected genetic isolation at small geographic scales. In L. tigripictilis, we also
detected measurable phenotypic differentiation.
In the lower Congo River, both T. depressum and L. tigripictilis are confined to relatively sheltered shoreline habitats that are in many ways similar to those along the
shores of the Great Lakes with a linear array of rocky,
sandy, and intermediate substrates. However the hydrodynamics of this powerful river system are strikingly different from those of the Great Lakes. Between the
western edge of Pool Malebo and the Atlantic Ocean, the
Congo River descends some 280m. This steep drop generates an array of sheltered, isolated habitat patches separated by variously sized, and often extremely powerful,

rapids. In the study area, the width of the channel varies
more than five-fold, from a maximum of 1.6 km in the
Inga Reach to as little as 0.3 km in several intervening
narrow chutes. Many of these constricted regions are
associated with high-energy rapids that span the entire
width of the channel and interrupt stretches of suitable
cichlid habitat. Because of these geographic features and
the high levels of endemism documented for this river
reach, the Lower Congo River represents an important
new biohydrologic model system for exploring the isolating mechanisms underlying patterns of species diversification. Consistent with the extreme hydrological forces
operating in the LCR, our estimates of genetic isolation
are among the highest reported for any African cichlid
species on a comparable geographic scale (cf. [5,6]).
Two relatively small but intense rapids lie between the
most strongly differentiated T. depressum populations at
Sites A and B. The rapids at Isangala and Fwamalo are
both associated with a narrowing of the river channel (0.8
km across at Isangala, 0.3 km at Fwamalo). In both cases,
an area of whitewater extends from bank to bank. Analysis of the modest number of available samples at sites B
and C did not permit rejection of the null hypothesis of
panmixia along the much larger, wider, and shallower
rapids at Inga. This pattern may be a result of either
reduced statistical power owing to modest sample sizes,
or a genuine reflection of population connectivity along
the complex shoreline in this stretch with its numerous
potential stepping stone habitats.
Perhaps not surprisingly (given its broader distribution
and habitat range) the pattern among Lamprologus tigripictilis samples is more complex. Assignment tests support
the presence of two distinct genetic clusters at Sites A and
B, however the probability of belonging to either cluster is
not related to the collection locality, and many individuals have intermediate assignment probabilities. A single
individual collected from Site C also belongs to one of
these two clusters. Almost all individuals at sites D and E
assign to a single genetic cluster. Estimates of ϕst between
each pair of adjacent collection localities were all signifi-

cantly different from zero, although we treat this allele
frequency based result cautiously because sample sizes
were modest, particularly at sites D and E. The highest ϕst
estimate was between samples from Sites B and D (the
single individual genotype from Site C was excluded from
this analysis). This genetic break was also detected in the
mtDNA data set. Our morphometric analysis detected
phenotypic divergence across this genetic barrier as well,
suggesting that the barrier is strong enough for selection
or drift to maintain phenotypic differences between populations.
Because the rugged terrain of the LCR did not permit
us to collect samples along a formal transect, we cannot
unambiguously determine which specific biogeographic
barriers maintain population isolation. However the
overall patterns of genetic divergence suggest that two
species may not respond identically to the same barriers.
In T. depressum, the strongest genetic break is between
Sites A and B, and the two sets of intervening narrow rapids likely play a role in isolating these populations. Lamprologus tigripictilis populations from these two sites are
also significantly different from each other as measured
using ϕst, however the level of genetic differentiation is
lower than in T. depressum from the same sites or from L.
tigripictilis populations from further downstream.
In L. tigripictilis there is an intriguing general trend of
lower genetic diversity at downstream sites relative to
upstream sites. However, we detected no evidence of
recent genetic bottlenecks in any of the populations, suggesting that the populations have existed in their current
state long enough to reach migration-mutation-drift
equilibrium. Relative to population B, population D has a
large number of private alleles. Indeed, at 8 of the 10 loci,
the most common allele in population D was not found in
population B suggesting almost no recent gene flow
between sites, consistent with long term isolation of these
populations. The large number of mtDNA substitutions
that distinguish upstream and downstream L. tigripictilis
haplotypes further supports the idea that the populations

Markert et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:149

have been isolated long enough to have achieved equilibrium.

Conclusions
The hotspots of species endemism of some African rivers
may be less speciose and far less famous than those of the
Great Lakes, yet they represent a substantial fraction of
cichlid biodiversity and available habitat. It is likely that
the observed relationship between landscape forces and
population genetic processes observed here is comparable to those operating during the early stages of ecological
divergence of many recognized endemic species in the
LCR. They may even help illuminate the origins of the
spectacular radiations within the Great Lakes. It has been
suggested patterns of cichlid evolution and adaptation to
high energy river environments may have had an influence on the spectacular patterns of philopatry and evolutionary divergence currently observed in rock-dwelling
species in the African Great Lakes [22,23]. Current phylogenenetic analyses indicate that these particular LCR
cichlids are not the direct ancestors of the Great Lakes
species flocks. However, the complex climate history of
Eastern Africa with frequent xeric periods suggests that
some of the founders of the Great Lakes faunas would
have spent part of their evolutionary history in river systems [24,25]. We hypothesize that philopatry in high
energy river systems may be adaptive for these small
physoclistous species. If early lake colonists were also
philopatric, this 'preadaptation' would have had a profound influence on evolution of species diversity in the
African Great Lakes.
Methods
Field

Teleogramma depressum and Lamprologus tigripictilis
were collected at multiple sites along a 100 km stretch of
the Congo River between the settlements of Kinganga
and Matadi (Figure 1). This region includes the Inga
Reach, the world's largest and most powerful series of
rapids with an elevational drop of 102 m over the 28 km
run. Sample sizes and coordinates are shown in Table 1.
Sampling in these habitats is extremely challenging due
to a combination of limited river access and extreme
hydrological conditions. Nonetheless samples were available from three distinct localities for T. depressum (spanning the known distributional range of the species) and
five localities for L. tigripictilis. Tissue samples were field
preserved in 95% ethanol, and voucher specimens were
preserved in formalin and transferred to 70% ethanol for
morphological analysis. Ethanol preserved tissue samples
were stored at -80˚ C until DNA extraction. Collections
and specimen processing was conducted in accordance
with the American Fisheries Society's Guidelines for The
Use of Fishes in Research [26].

Morphometrics

A set of homologous landmarks [27] was selected to best
capture shape variation in each species (additional file 1).
Overall shape variation was best described in the dorsoventrally depressed Teleogramma by selecting landmarks
from a stable dorsal projection, while in Lamprologus
variation was captured in lateral projection (Figures 2-A
and 2-D). The landmark configuration for each specimen
was captured using Tps Dig v2.05 [28] translated, scaled
to unit centroid size and rotated with Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA). After applying GPA, residual disparity among configurations depends entirely on shape
variation and consensus configurations or mean shapes
are obtained. Shape variables were analyzed with partial
warp analysis (corresponding to a principal components
analysis of variance, α = 0), using PCAGen6 [29]. The
partial warps summarize the original variance of subsamples/populations and describe major trends in shape
change. Hotelling's T statistics were calculated using
TwoGroups6h [25] to test for phenotypic differentiation
between populations from Sites A-C and D-E for Lamprologus, and Sites A and B-C for Teleogramma. These
partitions were selected based on observed genetic
groupings.
Molecular Techniques

DNA was extracted using Quiagen DNeasy kits according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes were determined by
sequencing, using published primers, a combined 2044
base pairs comprised of partial cytochrome b (Concheiro
Pérez et al., 2007) and ND2 (Kocher et al., 1995). PCR
reactions were performed with Ready-To-Go PCR beads
(GE Healthcare) using a thermal profile of 94°C:30; 4952°C 1:00 and 72°C 1:30 for 30 cycles. PCR products were
cleaned with AMPure (Agencourt) prior to a sequencing
reaction with Big Dye Terminator Reaction Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with
CleanSEQ (Agencourt), suspended in 0.5 mM EDTA, and
run on an ABI 3730xl automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequences used in this study have GenBank accession numbers from HM101344 to HM101461.
A panel of microsatellite loci developed for other
cichlid species was screened using DNA from both species, and 10 polymorphic loci were identified for each
species. Primer sequences and the GenBank source loci
are shown in additional file 2. Primers were purchased
with fluorescent dye labels conforming to Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) chemistry. All loci were PCR
amplified using Applied Biosystems AmpliTaq Gold 2x
PCR master mix and a thermal profile of 95°C 1:00; 52°C
1:00 and 72°C 2:00 for 30 cycles.
PCR products were diluted ~1:20 in HPLC grade water
and mixed with Applied Biosystems HiDi formamide and

Analyses

As noted previously collecting fish in many sections of
the LCR is logistically challenging and limits the number
of individuals available for genetic analysis. Fortunately,
the individually based assignment methods implemented
in Structure 2.2 do not require a priori assumptions of
population structure or group membership, and inferences derived using this approach do not rely on precise
estimates of allele frequencies within habitat patches [30].
Structure 2.2 was used to determine both the number of
likely genetic groups and the affinity of individuals for
these clusters. For each species, the likelihood of genetic
clusters ranging from 1 to 6 was evaluated using a burnin time of 10,000 followed by 30,000 repetitions. Simulations were replicated 15 times for each potential number
of clusters, and the likelihood scores were averaged to
determine the most probable number of clusters. Basic
diversity and connectivity statistics were calculated using
either GenoDive 2.0b14 [31] and GenAlEx 6.2 [32]. We
tested for recent population constrictions using Bottleneck 2.2 [33]. Isolation by distance tests were performed
where possible using IBD v 1.52 [34].
Interpopulation mtDNA distances were calculated
using MEGA 4.0.2 [35]. Haplotype diagrams were derived
from the mtDNA sequences using TCS v1.21 (Clement et
al., 2000).

Authors' contributions
All three authors contributed to the writing of this paper and overall study
design. Specimen vouchers and tissue samples were collected by MLJS and
RCS during several expeditions to the study region in Bas Congo, Democratic
Republic of Congo. JAM initiated the study, and conducted the nDNA microsatellite analyses. MLJS coordinated the project, undertook the morphological
analyses and prepared the figures. RCS conducted the mtDNA analyses and
prepared the haplotype diagrams. All three authors have read and approved
the final version of this manuscript.
