Abstract
Background: Construction and interpretation of phylogenetic trees has been a major research
topic for understanding the evolution of genes. Increases in sequence data and complexity are
creating a need for more powerful and insightful tree visualization tools.
Results: We have developed 3D Phylogeny Explorer (3DPE), a novel phylogeny tree viewer that
maps trees onto three spatial axes (species on the X-axis; paralogs on Z; evolutionary distance on
Y), enabling one to distinguish at a glance evolutionary features such as speciation; gene duplication
and paralog evolution; lateral gene transfer; and violation of the "molecular clock" assumption.
Users can input any tree on the online 3DPE, then rotate, scroll, rescale, and explore it interactively
as "live" 3D views. All objects in 3DPE are clickable to display subtrees, connectivity path
highlighting, sequence alignments, and gene summary views, and etc. To illustrate the value of this
visualization approach for microbial genomes, we also generated 3D phylogeny analyses for all
clusters from the public COG database. We constructed tree views using well-established methods
and graph algorithms. We used Scientific Python to generate VRML2 3D views viewable in any web
browser.
Conclusion: 3DPE provides a novel phylogenetic tree projection method into 3D space and its
web-based implementation with live 3D features for reconstruction of phylogenetic trees of COG
database.

Background
Visual representation of phylogenetic trees is an active
research topic in evolutionary biology, because it is the
main way that scientists view and interpret phylogenetic
trees. Traditionally, phylogenetic trees have been represented as two-dimensional (flat) diagrams [1-3]. This is
not due to phylogeny being in any sense "naturally" twodimensional, but rather to the constraints of drawing such

diagrams on paper. However, as sequence datasets grow
exponentially due to genome and other sequencing
projects, the difficulties of interpreting phylogenetic tree
diagrams are also growing in size and complexity.
Recently, there have been many efforts to improve visualization of complex phylogenetic trees [3-10]. One can
simplify 2D trees by merging similar subtrees into higher

taxonomy classification [5]. This "data compression" procedure can make huge trees into simpler forms.
It is useful to consider how tree interpretation is limited
by the assumption of two dimensionality. Since one
dimension ordinarily represents the evolutionary distance
metric (e.g. how distant two sequences are from their
most recent common ancestor (MRCA)), the 2D assumption leaves only one dimension for representing other
information. For example, in one common application
("Tree of Life", analyzing a gene sequence from different
species, to determine the evolutionary relationships of
these species), this second dimension is used to indicate
species relationships, by placing the most closely related
species proximal to each other on this dimension. However, modern gene phylogenies are far more complex than
just this speciation process. Paralogous gene families,
gene duplication and loss, and horizontal gene transfer
are major processes of evolution that visualization should
also reveal, orthogonal to speciation. Unfortunately, trying to squeeze these very different dimensions of evolution onto a single spatial axis violates a basic principle of
visual data-mining, namely that each independent variable should be assigned an orthogonal axis. Combining
many different variables into one can make it hard to see
any of them clearly. Thus, whereas two dimensions may
be adequate for "Tree of Life" phylogenies containing
exactly one sequence per species (i.e. the tree consists only
of speciation branching), more complex phylogenies may
be obscured by the two-dimensional assumption.
An obvious solution is to apply three-dimensional visualization techniques to phylogenetic trees, so that multiple
independent variables (e.g. species vs. paralog vs. evolutionary distance) can each be assigned an orthogonal axis. We
will refer to this approach as "dimensional visualization
of phylogeny" to emphasize the idea that each independent variable is viewed on a separate dimension.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/213

In this paper we describe 3-Dimensional Phylogeny
Explorer (3DPE), a novel algorithm for phylogeny layout
that implements the dimensional visualization of phylogeny approach. It maps trees onto three spatial axes (species
on the X-axis; paralogs on Z; evolutionary distance on Y),
making interpretation of the tree visually intuitive (Fig. 1).
Sequences with the same X coordinate come from the
same species (and therefore must be paralogs). Sequences
with the same Z coordinate constitute one orthologous
group (i.e. they are orthologs, the "same gene" in different
species). As is conventional for phylogenetic trees, the Y
coordinate (height) represents evolutionary distance
(often treated as a proxy for evolutionary time). Using this
dimensional visualization, it is easy to distinguish at a
glance different events such as speciation, gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer. We have created a web
service that creates 3D visualizations of user-supplied
phylogenetic trees viewable in any VRML-enabled web
browser or VRML viewer. Furthermore, to illustrate the
utility of this visualization approach, we have applied it to
the well-known COG database, a large-scale database of
gene families from microbial genomes [11-14]. Using
3DPE, one can easily navigate phylogenetic trees in 'real'
3D space as well as interactive online tree manipulations.
One important aspect of 3DPE is that users can employ
any operational taxonomic unit (OTU) choice that they
wish to display on 3DPE's X-axis, by supplying whatever
OTU information they like in the user-supplied tree format. Because the simple examples shown in this paper are
all based on species as the OTU (using species information
from the COG database), we will refer to the OTU in these
examples as "species". As defined by Koonin, "Orthologs
are genes derived from a single ancestral gene in the last
common ancestor of the compared species, and paralogs
are genes related via duplication [15]". We follow this definition in 3DPE and in this paper.

Methods
Recently there has been growing interest in three-dimensional visualization of trees, for example projecting a twodimensional tree onto a three-dimensional surface such as
a disk or cone [4] that can be rotated or zoomed in 3D. We
will refer to this approach as "projection of phylogeny
onto a surface". Such projections can provide a useful
interface for navigating a large, complex tree (using intuitive 3D operations such as rotation). However, this is
quite different from dimensional visualization of phylogeny. In the projection approach the tree is still visualized
on a surface (the two dimensional surface of a three
dimensional disk or cone), and the layout of the tree on
this 2D surface does not differ fundamentally from standard 2D tree layout.

Introduction to 3DPE tree layout
3DPE differs from traditional 2D tree layout in several
ways. One can consider 2D phylogenetic trees to represent
two distinct variables: sequences on the X-axis and evolutionary distance on Y. (e.g. for a Tree of Life phylogeny,
there is a 1:1 mapping between individual sequences and
individual species, because there should only be a single
sequence for each species). A given 2D tree can have many
possible ordering of sequences from left to right (a tree
with N internal branch nodes has 2N possible orderings)
that are equally valid. By contrast, 3DPE projects phylogenetic trees onto three spatial axes as shown in Figure 1.
The core operation in 3DPE is that leaves (sequences)
must be assigned (X, Z) coordinates (species on the X-axis;
paralogs on Z); the Y coordinate represents evolutionary distance, just as in conventional 2D trees. Specifically, every

2D vs. 3DPE views of the same tree
2D vs. 3DPE views of the same tree. In standard (2D) phylogeny layout it is not always easy to distinguish gene duplication
events (paralogs) from speciation branching (species), because only one spatial axis (labelled "genes" in the diagram above) is
available to show the mix of these two kinds of information. By contrast, they can be distinguished at a glance in 3DPE, because
it projects them onto two orthogonal axes; species (X) vs. paralogs (Z). For example, whereas the evolution of a large number
of paralogs is visually obvious in the 3DPE view (in the three eukaryote species, on the right), this pattern is less clear in the 2D
representation. Both trees represent COG1222, and 2D tree was downloaded from the COG database.

species must be assigned a distinct X value; every sequence
must be assigned to one orthologous group; and each orthologous group must be assigned a distinct Z value.
Source data: user phylogenetic trees
3DPE takes a standard phylogenetic tree as the starting
point of its analysis. Currently, 3DPE can take a user-supplied phylogenetic tree in the Newick format, or phylogenetic tree files from PHYLIP. One important point is that
3DPE needs species information for all sequences in the

user-supplied tree, i.e. each species must be assigned a
unique identifier, and each sequence must have a species
attribute giving the ID of its source species. 3DPE follows
a simple convention for reading species information from
a sequence "name" string: the sequence name string must
be of the form 'species|gene' (e.g. "Mac|MA4123" means
"Mac" is the species identifier, and "MA4123" is the gene
identifier). 3DPE requires that the user-supplied tree provide branch length information, indicating the evolutionary distance between each pair of nodes.

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:213

Defining orthologous groups
In addition to a phylogenetic tree and species information, 3DPE needs orthologous group information for each
gene. While in principle this orthology information could
be supplied by the user (e.g. from databases such as
HOMOLOGENE [16]), 3DPE cannot assume that users
will always be able to supply such information, and therefore performs a standard orthology analysis using wellestablished algorithms. 3DPE separates paralogs into distinct orthologous groups following the simple rule that
(by definition) any pair of homologs in one species must
be paralogs. To decide whether genes from different species are orthologs, 3DPE currently follows the widely used
conservative criterion of reciprocal best hits [11-14]. It
should be noted that a different criterion would only
change the Z-coordinate of genes, leaving typical views
(e.g. Figure 2) large unchanged. Briefly, for each gene, its
best hit in each species is identified based on minimum
pairwise evolutionary distances; an orthologous group is
defined as a fully connected clique of reciprocal best hits.
Constructing 3D phylogeny layout
3DPE enforces two layout constraints: 1) genes from the
same species must have the same X coordinates; 2) genes
from the same orthologous group must have the same Z
coordinates. The 3DPE layout problem can therefore be
reduced to choosing 1) the order of species on the X axis;
2) the order of orthologous groups on the Z axis. Thus, for
a dataset with i total species and j distinct orthologous
groups, the number of possible 3DPE layouts is i!j!. 3DPE
assesses the visual clarity of these distinct layout possibilities by a very simple criterion: it seeks to minimize the
number of "edge-crossing" (where two tree branch edges
cross in X or Z; for example, if closely related paralogs are
separated by more distant paralogs in the layout, this will
result in "edge-crossings" where one branch of the tree
must cross another branch visually). In an effort to reduce
edge-crossings, 3DPE employs several new approaches.
First, it reorients 2D phylogenetic trees by evolutionary
order relative to the tree's root; specifically, depth-first
search (DFS, starting from root) preferentially descending
the shorter child branch first at each node. The algorithm
visits all internal nodes one by one and decides the orientation of each child by two simple rules: deepest subtree
first (tree depth is defined as number of edges from leaf to
root node) and largest subtree first (defined as the total
number of leaves in given subtree). By convention, 3DPE
lays out the tree in a consistent orientation based on tree
depth in descending order: genes with maximum tree
depth values (furthest from root) at left front corner and
genes with minimum tree depth values (closest to root) at
right back corner of 3D layout. Second, while walking the
reoriented tree via DFS traversal in post-order, initial coordinates are assigned to species (X) and orthologous
groups (Z); as each gene is visited, if its species does not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/213

yet have a coordinate, it is assigned the next X value (X+1),
and similarly for its orthologous group (on Z). When
available, pairwise distances from PROTDIST were used to
determine the distances between species or orthologous
groups. Third, 3DPE minimizes any remaining simple
edge-crossings using several heuristic rules by switching
coordinates of two species or orthologous groups [17].
When edge-crossings cannot be eliminated by any branch
orientation swap, this is a useful indicator of possible lateral gene transfer events (see Fig. 1 for an example).
Finally, X and Z coordinates for each internal node are calculated as the averages of its two child nodes, Y coordinates as evolutionary distance from original phylogenetic
trees. 3DPE uses Scientific Python with extensions to output its 3D visualizations in the standard VRML2 format
(viewable in any VRML2 viewer or web browser plugin);
other 3D file formats could easily be generated.

Implementation
3DPE analysis of the COG database
As a demonstration of the value of 3DPE for interpreting
complex phylogenies, and as a resource for the microbial
genome research community, we have performed 3DPE
analysis of the complete Clusters of Orthologous Genes
(COG) database of microbial genomes. We downloaded
the COG database (2003 release) from NCBI and all flat
files were parsed and stored in MySQL database. We next
constructed 2D phylogenetic trees using standard methods: CLUSTALW [18] to generate multiple alignments,
which are input files for PHYLIP packages [19]; PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR (UPGMA) from PHYLIP packages
with default option were used to generate traditional 2D
phylogenetic trees. The UPGMA method in NEIGHBOR
assumes molecular clock and generates a rooted tree [19].
3DPE used pairwise distance from PROTDIST to assign
the distances between species or orthologous groups. Precalculated CLUSTALW multiple alignments and PHYLIP
trees were also stored in MySQL for fast processing.

3DPE currently has several limitations: 1) It requires a
rooted tree as input. In general, it is recommended that
users employ outgroup analysis to identify the likely root
location of their input tree [20]. 2) It requires branch
lengths to be provided for the tree, and currently expects
these to conform to the molecular clock assumption
(although we expect to relax this expectation in the
future). 3) The pre-calculated trees for the COG database
viewable on the 3DPE website were generated using
UPGMA. We encourage users to employ their preferred
tree construction methods (such as Neighbor-Joining) for
generating input trees to view in 3DPE.

group is assigned a unique plane on the Z-axis; and the Y-axis represents evolutionary distance. This can both yield valuable
insights and reveal potential problems with the tree; e.g. the absence of paralogs in the Archaea suggests that these paralogs
were created after the divergence of Eukaryota and Archaea, and thus that the tree's root should actually be at the node
marked with an asterisk (*). Thus, 3DPE can make it easier to spot potential errors in the tree, which could be tested using
other methods such as outgroup analysis. Genes are represented as hexagonal boxes and each species has its distinct color.

sor to VRML2, but many VRML2 viewer and plugin are
available publicly. However, most of programs are
focused on visualizing a single large VRML2 file running
in local machine. Because implementation of interactive
web-based application is dependent on availability of
VRML2 plugin, we used the Cortona Plugin for develop-

ing 3DPE as a web-based application and it is successfully
tested on Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer running
in Microsoft Windows. Popup blocking in the web
browser must be disabled to use all of its functionality;
alternatively one can add the 3DPE web server to the
browser's list of allowed hosts. Otherwise, some of 3DPE

interactive features cannot be viewed; in some cases this
can crash the web browser. A basic tutorial for Cortona
Plugin is available at the 3DPE web site.
Interactive web interface and user tree format
We used simple Python CGI to construct interactive interface and requested data will be retrieved from MySQL
database based on user queries for fast processing. Moreover, 3DPE basic view can be manipulated in several ways.
First, it can be zoomed, panned or rotated in 3D in any
web browser (features of VRML2 Cortona Plugin). Text
size in VRML2 object is small not to interfere with other
VRML2 objects and one can zoom in & out to read annotations. Second, users can click any item for more information: gene information (LocusTag, GenBank GI linking
to NCBI protein database, species and sequence, by clicking the gene); multiple alignment; a protein family summary (by clicking the root of the tree); subtree
highlighting (clicking any edge highlights all edges below
it in the tree); subtree view (clicking any node reduces the
view to just the subtree below that node); connectivity
highlighting (clicking any two edges highlights the path
connecting them). Users can upload any phylogenetic tree
for viewing in 3DPE using modified version of Newick
formats (see Methods), online at 3DPE website. To demonstrate the utility of 3DPE, we have also pre-computed a
database of phylogenetic trees for all proteins in the COG
microbial sequence database, available online as live
3DPE views. Users can search the database using COG ID
and text searches against PubMed records.

Results and Discussion
Interpreting 3D phylogeny
3DPE is a novel web-based tree viewer that makes it easy
to distinguish gene duplication events (paralog branching) from speciation branching. It projects gene phylogeny onto three spatial axes: each species is mapped to a
unique location on the X-axis; each orthologous group is
assigned a unique plane on the Z-axis; and the Y-axis represents evolutionary distance (Fig. 2). Genes are shown as
boxes at the bottom, colored by species. This layout makes
it trivially easy to perceive paralogs, which traditionally
can require some scrutiny in a large tree. It also becomes
easy to distinguish speciation branchings (horizontal, Xaxis) vs. paralog branchings (depth, Z-axis). For example,
in COG1222 we can see that the olive (64091, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1) paralogs were created subsequent to the
green (188937, Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A) speciations, whereas the yellow-red (6035, Encephalitozoon
cuniculi) paralogs branched before these species diverged.

3DPE also provides a valuable tool for cross-validating
different aspects of the tree, and checking common phylogenetic assumptions such as the molecular clock principle. 3DPE's spatial layout makes it easy to see whether

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/213

different paralog subtrees are consistent. For example, in
COG1222, the yellow-red paralogs all show the same speciation trees (Fig. 2). The consistent spatial layout also
makes it possible to spot anomalies such as possible horizontal gene transfer or molecular clock violations at a
glance. For example, edges that cross subtree boundaries
(such as the olive to green connection in COG1222) suggests that either the tree is incorrect or a horizontal gene
transfer event has occurred. Similarly, variations in the
lengths of connections between subtrees can suggest violations of the molecular clock assumption. For example,
in COG1222, the last paralog subtree (at the back of the Z
axis) shows a much larger evolutionary distance between
the yellow vs. orange (4896, Schizosaccharomyces pombe)
species, compared with the other paralog subtrees. Thus a
violation of the molecular clock assumption appears to
have occurred. Of course, while 3DPE can provide clues as
to whether a molecular clock violation can be suspected,
users should test such hypotheses rigorously using other
methods [21]. In general, it is recommended that users
employ outgroup analysis to identify the likely root location of their input tree [20].
Figure 3 shows a simple example of how to distinguish
recent duplications from more ancient paralogs, based on
their order relative to speciation events. On the one hand,
some duplications are highly similar to each other and
appear to have occurred subsequent to any speciation
event, because they are only found in one species and not
in other species (Figure 3, example marked B). On the
other hand, other duplications are found in parallel in a
series species, indicating that they were created prior to
the divergence of these species (Figure 3, example marked
A).
Limitations
Although 3DPE provides powerful tools for looking at
complex phylogenies, extremely large phylogenetic trees
can still be too much to interpret in a single 3DPE view.
As a partial solution, the 3DPE web interface makes it easy
to select any subtree for extraction as a separate 3DPE
view. This enables the user to browse different parts of a
huge tree easily and without information loss. Another
limitation is the availability and ease of use of 3D viewing
software. Although we have made 3DPE compatible with
the well-known VRML2 standard for viewing 3D data
using web browser plugins, we feel current VRML2 viewers are not completely satisfactory in their availability and
ease of use. For example, while a number of VRML2
viewer programs are available (Cortona, FreeWRL, etc.),
certain platforms do not yet have plugin support (e.g. new
Macintoshes using Intel processors). Furthermore, current
plugins are not as easy to use as we would like; e.g. the
user must learn a particular plugin's mouse and keyboard
commands for 3D navigation. However, VRML2 plugins

are rapidly improving, and are likely to be widely available and easier to use in the future. In order to maintain upto-date contents, we will update 3DPE if new COG database is released. Furthermore, we will support other types
of 3D viewer & plugin for various users working in various
platforms.
