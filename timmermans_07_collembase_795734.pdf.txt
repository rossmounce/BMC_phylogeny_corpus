Abstract
Background: Environmental quality assessment is traditionally based on responses of
reproduction and survival of indicator organisms. For soil assessment the springtail Folsomia candida
(Collembola) is an accepted standard test organism. We argue that environmental quality
assessment using gene expression profiles of indicator organisms exposed to test substrates is
more sensitive, more toxicant specific and significantly faster than current risk assessment
methods. To apply this species as a genomic model for soil quality testing we conducted an EST
sequencing project and developed an online database.
Description: Collembase is a web-accessible database comprising springtail (F. candida) genomic
data. Presently, the database contains information on 8686 ESTs that are assembled into 5952
unique gene objects. Of those gene objects ~40% showed homology to other protein sequences
available in GenBank (blastx analysis; non-redundant (nr) database; expect-value < 10-5). Software
was applied to infer protein sequences. The putative peptides, which had an average length of 115
amino-acids (ranging between 23 and 440) were annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. In
total 1025 peptides (~17% of the gene objects) were assigned at least one GO term (expect-value
< 10-25). Within Collembase searches can be conducted based on BLAST and GO annotation,
cluster name or using a BLAST server. The system furthermore enables easy sequence retrieval for
functional genomic and Quantitative-PCR experiments. Sequences are submitted to GenBank
(Accession numbers: EV473060 – EV481745).
Conclusion: Collembase http://www.collembase.org is a resource of sequence data on the
springtail F. candida. The information within the database will be linked to a custom made
microarray, based on the Agilent platform, which can be applied for soil quality testing. In addition,
Collembase supplies information that is valuable for related scientific disciplines such as molecular
ecology, ecogenomics, molecular evolution and phylogenetics.

Background
Organisms are able to maintain homeostasis in changing
environments by regulating their metabolic machinery.
To accomplish this, organisms continuously have to
adjust the expression of their genes. This is particularly
evident when environmental challenges drive organisms
to the boundaries of their ecological niche and induce
stress responses (e.g. [1]). In recent years, significant
understanding has been obtained on the signal transduction pathways by which stress affects gene transcription
[2]. The question arises whether it is possible to sense
aspects of the environment by investigating transcriptional profiles of exposed organisms.
Recent advances in the field of toxicogenomics suggest
that environmental quality can indeed be diagnosed by
transcriptional profiling [3] and it is generally acknowledged that genomic techniques, and more specifically
transcriptomics, have the potential to revolutionize environmental risk assessment [4-9]. The prospects are that
gene expression studies will enable a fast and sensitive
detection and evaluation of environmental stressors and
toxicants. This is strengthened by the fact that several
recent studies have shown that transcription profiling can
be applied as an early indicator of toxicity [10,11] in a
dose-dependent manner [12].
We started a project that aims to develop a microarraybased methodology for soil quality assessment using the
parthenogenetic springtail Folsomia candida (Collembola). This species, which is easy to culture and has a short
generation time, was chosen because it is already a standard test organism in ecotoxicology [13]. It lives in direct
contact with the soil and toxicological data are already
widely available (e.g. ECOTOX database from U.S. EPA
[14]). Furthermore, a standard test looking at survival and
reproduction after 28 day exposure is in place that follows
OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development) and ISO (International Standard Organization) guidelines. Although the latter test is conducted in
a standardized laboratory setting, it has been shown that
the outcomes are predictive of natural situations [15].
However, there are several shortcomings to the current
test. First, it does not provide information about the
nature of the stressor. Second, the mode of action of toxicants cannot be verified. Third, the test is time-consuming
as it lasts for at least 28 days. Finally, the test is rather labor
intensive.
By extending the ISO standard test with genomic technologies, these shortcomings may be circumvented. However, genomic information on F. candida is very poor: a
search for sequences yields only 52 hits in the National
Center of Biotechnology (NCBI;[16]) nucleotide database
(July 5th 2007), mainly consisting of 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/341

and cytochrome c oxidase sequences used as phylogenetic
markers.
A time- and cost effective way to retrieve sequence information on the functional part of the genome is to set up
an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) project, which was conducted for the F. candida transcriptome. Here we report on
the sequencing and annotation of ~9000 ESTs, which
form the starting point for the construction of an oligo
array that can be applied in soil quality testing. The
sequences were processed, assembled, BLAST-based annotated and stored in a web-accessible database [17]. The
database can be searched for BLAST-based annotations
and Gene Ontology terms [18] and by using a stand alone
BLAST server. Collembase furthermore enables retrieval of
sequence information on (differentially) expressed genes,
which can then be applied in functional genomic and
Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction (Q-PCR) validation experiments.
Although Collembase was primarily created for the development of a microarray, we expect that it is of interest for
researchers outside the field of ecotoxicology as well. Due
to its short generation time, F. candida is often used in ecological studies [13]. In addition, Collembola have a crucial position in the phylogeny of the arthropods and, thus,
also have the attention from evolutionary biologists (e.g.
[19]). The retrieved genome data will significantly
enhance molecular ecological and evolutionary studies on
F. candida.

Construction and content
Construction of cDNA libraries
To restrict redundant sequencing we chose to start our EST
project with a normalized cDNA pool. RNA extraction
from the parthenogenetic, clonally reproducing collembolan Folsomia candida (laboratory strain 'Berlin'; Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam) was carried out using the Spin
Vacuum (SV) Total RNA isolation system (Promega). Animals (eggs, juveniles and adult females) were taken from
a culture of mixed age with a more or less even age distribution. All animals (~100 mg) were pooled before RNA
extraction. Concentration and purity of the total RNA
pool was checked by UV absorption (260 and 280 nm).
Quality of total RNA was evaluated on a 1% agarose gel
(stained with SYBR Gold stain; Invitrogen) and on an Agilent BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Afterwards 0.1
volumes of 3 M sodium acetate and 3 volumes of 96%
ethanol were added and total RNA was shipped at room
temperature to Evrogen (Moscow, Russia).

Double-stranded cDNA synthesis (SMART technology
[20]), normalization and library construction were performed by Evrogen. The reaction was started with 0.3 μg
total RNA and cDNA was SMART amplified (18 PCR

cycles) and normalized by the procedure described by
[21], which consists of cDNA denaturation/reassociation,
a duplex-specific nuclease (DNS) treatment [22] and PCR
amplification. The cDNA thus obtained was used for
library construction as follows. The cDNA was incubated
with restriction enzymes Sbf1 and Not1, and ligated into
Sbf1 and Not1 digested pAL17.2 vector (Evrogen). The
resulting plasmids were subsequently transformed into E.
coli (Evrogen). Finally, glycerol stocks were made (17%
glycerol), which were transferred to the Vrije Universiteit
(Amsterdam) on dry-ice and stored at -80°C until further
use.
Efficiency of the procedure was examined by determining
the abundance of several transcripts before and after normalization using Q-PCR. Primers were developed based
on five available GenBank accessions and β-actin. Genes
amplified were β-actin (GenBank:EU037094), USP-RXR
Ultrabitorax
(GenBank:
(GenBank:AY157930),
AF435789), Kruppel (GenBank:AF395109), RNA helicase
Dead1 (GenBank:AY043229) and 28S rDNA (GenBank:
AF483424). Primer sequences are given on [17] (see Additional file 1). Primers were developed using Primer
Express version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City,
USA), using the following parameters: Minimum Tm: 59–
60°C, Maximum Tm difference between primers: 1°,
Oligo length: 20–25 bp, Amplicon length: 90–120 bp.
Real-time PCR was performed on an Opticon 1 real-time
PCR machine (MJ Research) using SYBR green 2X Mastermix (Finnzymes), according to [23]. Real time PCR reactions used 3 μl normalized and non-normalized nonligated cDNA template (0.2 μg/100μl). The program used
for amplification was: denaturation (95°C for 15 min.),
2-step amplification and quantification (92°C for 15s,
60°C for 1 min. and one fluorescence measurement),
melting curve program (60–90°C with a heating rate of
0.1°C per second and one fluorescence measurement per
second). As can be seen in Figure 1 the normalization procedure was effective: transcripts that were highly abundant
in the original pool (Figure 1A) occurred considerably
diminished after normalization (Figure 1B) as compared
to lower abundant transcripts. Differences in Ct-values
between the high abundant 28S rRNA and β-actin transcripts and the less abundant USP-RXR and RNA helicase
Dead1 transcripts was reduced from about 14 cycles to
less than three cycles. However, the least abundant transcripts (Ultrabithorax and Kruppel) were not very well
enriched: they maintained high Ct-values.
De Boer et al. (unpublished data) constructed cDNA
libraries enriched for stress responsive genes as described
by [24]. In short, 960 clones were isolated from each of
two subtracted cDNA libraries enriched for 1) cadmiumand 2) phenanthrene responsive genes. Both libraries

were built using the suppression subtractive hybridization
procedure (SSH) [25] making use of poly (A)+ RNA isolated from ~150 exposed unsynchronized adult individuals (whole body; laboratory strain 'Berlin'; Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam). Exposure to cadmium was performed by placing animals on cellulose filters wetted to
approximately 50% water-holding capacity with a 267
μmole/l CdCl2 solution for 48 h. Animals were exposed to
phenanthrene by placing them on a compressed layer of
LUFA 2.2 soil spiked with 840 μm/kg phenanthrene
according to the standard ISO11267 [26] protocol for 6
days.
EST sequencing, bioinformatics and construction of the
database
In total, 9984 cDNA clones were picked and sequenced
(Greenomics; Wageningen University and Research
Center) using the M13 forward primer. Clones originating
from the normalized library were sequenced from the 5'
end of the gene (8064 total). The cDNA fragments from
the SSH procedure were not ligated directionally, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/341

therefore not sequenced from a predefined orientation
(960 clones from each of the two libraries).
Raw trace files were processed using Trace2dbest [27],
employing a Phred [28,29] quality threshold of 20 and a
minimal high quality sequence length of 150 base pairs
(bp). Of the 9984 sequences 1142 sequences did not pass
the quality control, and were excluded from further analysis. A summary of the number of sequences that
remained from each of the three libraries after processing
of the raw data is given in Table 1.
CLOBB [30] and Phrap (P. Green, personal communication [31]) were applied, as part of the Partigene script
[27], to cluster and assemble the ESTs into unique gene
objects. This procedure resulted in 6092 unique
sequences. There were 4686 singletons and 1406 clusters
with more than one sequence. Of those 1406 clusters 920
consisted of two sequences only. The redundancy
(defined as total number of sequences/clusters) was 1.45,
1.32 and 1.62 for the total dataset, the normalized library
and the cadmium library respectively, but appeared considerably higher in the phenanthrene enriched library
(3.18). The highest sequence depth also occurred the
phenanthrene enriched library with 98 ESTs in one cluster, compared to a maximum of 31 and 16 ESTs per cluster
for the normalized and cadmium library respectively.
Sequences that were assigned to one cluster were not
always assembled into one single contiguous consensus
sequence (contig) by Phrap, due to high quality base pair
differences between sequences. The Phrap assembly (Partigene default criteria) resulted in a total number of 6212
contigs instead of the 6092 given above (Table 2). The
length of those 6212 contigs ranged between 153 bp and
1636 bp and was on average 520 bp (see Additional file
2). The sequence variation that was observed within those
clusters might constitute natural occurring (allelic) variation (e.g. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), Taq
polymerase errors and/or gene duplications, and will have
to be confirmed by re-sequencing efforts.
Furthermore, a PERL script, which is made available on
[17], was used to determine the sequence overlap between
the three libraries. This script determined for each cluster

which library contributed ESTs to that cluster. The overlap
appeared rather low (Figure 2). Only seven clusters contained sequences from each of the three libraries (Table
3). At least three of those clusters remained un-annotated.
However, it has to be mentioned that the sequence overlap that was observed might be an underestimation of the
actual overlap in the database, as 5' sequencing (Normalized library) generally results in an overestimation of the
number of unique sequences [32].
The contigs were subjected to BLAST [33] searches of GenBank using blastx (against non-redundant database),
blastn (against non-redundant database), tblastx (against
dbEST) and an additional blastx (against non-redundant
database restricted to Insecta). In addition, sequences
were compared to all known and predicted proteins of
Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Mus
musculus. Those species were chosen as they have fully
sequenced genomes. In addition, C. elegans and D. melanogaster belong, like F. candida, to the group of molting
animals (Ecdysozoa). A summary of the BLAST analyses is
given in Table 4. Clusters that were perfect nucleotide
matches to baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; 125
clusters) and human sequences (15 clusters) were
regarded as contamination and later on removed. The relatively high number of yeast clusters observed (~2%) is
explained by the fact that in our laboratory F. candida is
fed baker's yeast. The fact that the food of F. candida is in
itself a genomic model species was advantageous when
pruning the database: these sequences are readily identified by their high bit and e-values scores in the BLAST
searches.
F. candida harbors intracellular bacteria of the genus Wolbachia [34] and its gut contains many bacterial species as
well [35]. Those might turn up as contaminating
sequences in the EST dataset. To pinpoint contaminating
sequences from bacterial origin the clusters were compared to all protein encoding sequences found in the
genome of Escherichia coli (GenBank: U00096) and in the
Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster (GenBank: AE017196). Sequences showing significant homology to E. coli or Wolbachia (blastx; e-value < 10-5), but
not to D. melanogaster, C. elegans or M. musculus, were
marked as putative contaminants. In total 70 of such clus-

ters were retrieved, which overlapped to a great extent (56
E. coli and 32 Wolbachia clusters): In total 18 clusters
appeared in both analyses (see Additional file 3). Those
putative 'bacterial clusters' were not excluded from further
analysis, as our procedure does not guarantee if a
sequence is contamination or not.
Table 3 shows the five most abundant transcripts for each
of the three libraries. The SSH procedure conducted on
phenanthrene exposed animals appeared efficient. Of the
top five phenanthrene clusters three show high similarities to monooxygenases of the cytochrome P450 enzyme

family, which are known to be involved in phase I
biotransformation of lipophilic substances such as phenanthrene [36]. The two other clusters show homology to
other monooxygenases, and might be involved in phase I
metabolism as well. The results for the cadmium library
are less straightforward. Two of the five most abundant
clusters remain un-annotated, and two clusters show
resemblance to accessions that are not from animal origin. Note that one of those two latter clusters (cluster
Fcc00170) occurred in all three libraries (Table 3). As with
the 'bacterial clusters', those clusters are currently not discarded from the database and are submitted to GenBank.
Supplementary experiments will be conducted to determine the exact origin of those clusters, and whether or not
they represent contaminants.
The absence of highly expressed house-keeping genes
among the five most abundant transcripts in the normalized library, suggests that the normalization procedure
was successful. Without normalization more highly abundant transcripts, like tubulins, ribosomal proteins and
actins, would have been sequenced (e.g. [37]). Although
these sequences are present in the dataset, they do not
form the list of most abundantly sequenced transcripts.
For example, more than 40 ribosomal protein sequences
were obtained (e.g. cluster Fcc02740), but most of these
were represented by only one or two ESTs.

The prot4EST [38] script was applied to infer protein
sequences (excluding the DECODER program). Putative
open reading frames of the total dataset ranged between
23 and 440 amino-acids, and had an average length of
115 amino-acids. The amino acid sequences were annotated with Gene Ontology terms (GO; http://geneontol
ogy.org) using the PartiGene [27] annot8r_blast2GO
script (Schmid and Blaxter, personal comm.; [39]). An
overview of the results of these analyses is given in Table

at least one GO term (expect-value < 10-25; 1025 contigs

and human mRNA from the analysis). The Partigene [27]
PERL scripts were used to store all the information in a
web-accessible relational database [17]. All processed
ESTs, excluding the ones marked as human and yeast contamination, were submitted to dbEST (accession numbers: – ).

Utility and discussion
Current contents of the database
Currently, Collembase comprises data on 8686 ESTs,
which are structured in 5952 clusters. That is 6092 minus
the 140 clusters from yeast and human origin. To enable
easy access to the sequence dataset, the information gathered was stored in a relational database and a web-interface was created. For all clusters data is offered on (1) the
ESTs within a cluster and their clone names, (2) the cDNA
library from which the ESTs originated, (3) blastx and
blastn hits against GenBank 'nr' databases and tblastx hits

against dbEST, which all will be updated regularly, (4) the
consensus sequences as generated by Phrap, and (5) the
GO terms when available. Furthermore, for each cluster
the BLAST results and the processed ESTs can be downloaded.
Collembase can be explored library-specific using text
queries (e.g. cluster name or BLAST annotation) and by
sequence similarity using a local BLAST [33] server. Furthermore, a Primer3 web-server [40] was implemented to
enable PCR primer design on the assembled sequences.
Future application and intended uses of the database
Soil quality and risk assessment
The dataset presented here was generated mainly to
obtain the required genomic information to construct a
microarray for soil quality assessment. The array, which is
based on the Agilent microarray technology, is linked to

Collembase: The 60-mer oligos printed on the chip follow
the nomenclature of the clusters from which they were

retrieval. Sequences of differentially expressed genes can
be downloaded from Collembase and used in validation
experiments (e.g. Q-PCR). Furthermore, in the near future
we intend to store microarray and Q-PCR gene expression
data as well. This freely accessible online repository will
allow evaluation and analysis of the data by the scientific
community (sensu [41]).
The small overlap between the toxicant enriched libraries
and the normalized library (Figure 2), in combination
with the higher redundancy of the toxicant enriched
libraries (especially the phenanthrene library), suggests
that metal and PAH exposure trigger different genes in F.
candida. Although our expression data on F. candida still
have to be verified by actual gene expression assays, such
specificity would imply that transcription profiles contain
a signature of the nature of the stress, and that different
stresses can be distinguished by transcription profiling.
This view is strengthened by a recent ecotoxicogenomic
study by [42]. These authors showed that in the crustacean
Daphnia magna different substances belonging to one
chemical class (metals) can be discriminated on the basis
of their characteristic expression profiles. Finally, we
believe that transcription profiling will enable mechanistic insight in responses to mixtures of toxicants, a relatively new and unknown field in (eco)toxicology.

Other applications
The collembolan F. candida is frequently used in experimental studies (for a recent review see [13]), therefore
Collembase could be useful outside the field of ecotoxicology as well. We expect applicability in the following
research areas:
Ecogenomics
To fully disentangle the molecular mechanisms by which
organisms deal with ecological challenges and environ-

mental stress, additional ecologically relevant model
organisms are needed [36,43]. F. candida is among a few
others (e.g. free-living nematodes and earthworms
[37,44]) one of the first soil organisms that is subject to
EST sequencing. Collembase could form the basis of F.
candida becoming a model organism in the research field
of ecogenomics. F. candida has this potential as the species
is easy to rear in the laboratory, reproduces parthenogenetically, has a short generation time, has a well-defined
ecology and is traceable in (mesocosm) field experiments.
It seems obvious that the sequence information stored in
Collembase can be exploited to answer ecological questions, e.g. related to drought-tolerance, starvation and
microbial resistance in soil ecosystems.
Molecular ecology and population genetics
The EST dataset presented holds information applicable
in molecular ecological- and population genetic studies.
For example, within the dataset 184 contigs showing one
or more tandem-repeats (microsatellites) with a minimum of five repeats were discovered using the MISA PERL
script [45] (Additional file 4). Within some of the clusters
up to three different alleles were observed. However, due
to the limited redundancy in our dataset and the fact that
the libraries were constructed from animals from one parthenogenetic strain it is impossible to determine their
degree of polymorphism. Still, in theory those loci are
molecular markers that can be applied to unravel the
forces that maintain genetic diversity and generate population genetic structure in this soil and cave inhabiting
species. Furthermore, it seems obvious that the dataset
and its accompanying microarray could be helpful in
finding out whether transcriptional regulation is an
important driver of adaptive evolution in this species.
Phylogenetics and comparative genomics
Collembola take an exceptional and fascinating position
in the tree of life. Together with other basal hexapods (e.g.
Protura, Diplura) they are positioned in-between the
insects and crustaceans. However, recently some authors

suggested that the six-legged body plan found among
basal hexapods and insects evolved minimally twice (e.g.
[46,47]). The dataset presented here might add the
sequence information that is needed to gain a more
detailed insight into the evolution of these groups, and
the relationship between insects and crustaceans. Using
the BLAST tool, Collembase can be queried for genes valuable for phylogenetic inference. Degenerate PCR primers
can be developed on the retrieved sequences to obtain
information on other basal hexapod groups.

Conclusion
Collembase provides EST and related data on the springtail F. candida. In the near future this database will be supplemented with microarray expression data. We expect
that our strategy will impact soil quality testing. In addi-

tion, it is clear that Collembase holds information applicable to many fields of ecological sciences (e.g. molecular
ecology and ecogenomics, molecular evolution and phylogenetics).
