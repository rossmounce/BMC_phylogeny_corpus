early embryos

Abstract
Background: Although the transcriptome of minute quantities of cells can be profiled using nucleic acid
amplification techniques, it remains difficult to distinguish between active and stored messenger RNA. Transcript
storage occurs at specific stages of gametogenesis and is particularly important in oogenesis as stored maternal
mRNA is used to sustain de novo protein synthesis during the early developmental stages until the embryonic
genome gets activated. In many cases, stored mRNA can be several times more abundant than mRNA ready for
translation. In order to identify active mRNA in bovine oocytes, we sought to develop a method of isolating very
small amounts of polyribosome mRNA.
Results: The proposed method is based on mixing the extracted oocyte cytoplasm with a preparation of
polyribosomes obtained from a non-homologous source (Drosophila) and using sucrose density gradient
ultracentrifugation to separate the polyribosomes. It involves cross-linking the non-homologous polyribosomes and
neutralizing the cross-linking agent. Using this method, we show that certain stages of oocyte maturation coincide
with changes in the abundance of polyribosomal mRNA but not total RNA or poly(A). We also show that the
abundance of selected sequences matched changes in the corresponding protein levels.
Conclusions: We report here the successful use of a method to profile mRNA present in the polyribosomal
fraction obtained from as little as 75 mammalian oocytes. Polyribosomal mRNA fractionation thus provides a new
tool for studying gametogenesis and early development with better representation of the underlying physiological
status.

Background
Gametogenesis and embryonic development in mammals involve several major cellular events marked by an
unusual mode of messenger RNA management. In
nearly all animal species, mRNA molecules are stored in
the developing oocyte until use during maturation or
after fertilization [1-8]. These stored mRNAs direct protein synthesis during the period of transcriptional
silence, which begins when the germinal stage oocyte
reaches its full size [9-13] and lasts until embryonic

genome activation [14-16]. In cattle, this size is approximately 120 μm within a follicular antrum 3-5 mm in diameter [10,15,17]. During the period covering the
remaining follicular development (i.e. from 3 to 25 mm
in antral diameter), the post-LH-surge oocyte maturation, fertilization and the onset of embryonic genome
activation, very little genomic transcription occurs. It is
generally believed that transcript storage begins in the
early stages of oogenesis and may thus last for several
weeks. It is also believed that the transcripts are stored in
a particulate form [18] and lack the poly(A) portion,
although the latter detail remains the subject of debate. It
has been reported that shortening the poly(A) tail to less
than 50 nucleotides stabilizes the mRNA molecule and
keeps it from being either degraded or translated [19].

So far, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the steps that occur during this transcriptional silencing period. Early development is
characterized by major fluctuations in the abundance of
total and messenger RNA [2,20], with specific waves of
maternal RNA degradation [14,21]. These observations
have led to the belief that measurement of messenger
abundance provides little useful information about cells
that are storing RNA, since it does not distinguish
between mRNA that is 1) stabilized and stored and thus
not contributing to any cellular function; 2) recruited
and on its way to degradation, not contributing to the
translation process and 3) recruited and being translated
in de novo protein synthesis. In order to avoid the contribution of the stored or decaying molecules to the
mRNA abundance measurements, we seek to provide a
mean to isolate the mRNA population bound to the
translation apparatus. Messenger RNAs engaged in
translation are found to be bound by ribosomes
throughout the cytosol either freely or attached to the
cytoskeleton while dormant or stored transcripts are
accumulated in diverse forms of ribonucleoprotein complexes and particles [22]. It is also well known that
actively translated messengers are bound by multiple
ribosomal units [23-26].
The composition of these different particles makes it
possible to fractionate them by density gradient. Profiling of polyribosomal mRNA through standard sucrose
gradient fractionation procedure requires considerable
starting material (e.g. 200 μg of total RNA [27]).
A recent publication reports the development of a
method suitable for input material not fewer than five
Xenopus laevis oocyte, eggs or early embryos [28]. Considering the Xenopus oocyte contains about 15,000
times more total RNA comparatively to the bovine
counterpart (respectively 6 μg [29] and 340 pg [20]), the
method still requires too much input for work on mammalian early development. The relative scarcity of mammalian oocytes, egg and embryonic tissues is another
impediment to increasing understanding of mammalian
gametogenesis and early development, since the choice
of methods suitable for handling such minute quantities
of material is severely limited. Pre-amplifying the entire
transcriptome offers the possibility of studying the fluctuations in transcript abundance in these tissues. Minute
amounts of initial RNA can be amplified with success
[30-32] and provide sufficient output for high throughput approaches such as microarrays [33,34] or systematic deep sequencing (RNAseq) [35,36].
To our knowledge, the isolation of polyribosomes
from mammalian oocytes or early embryos has been
reported only twice and resulted in limited success
[37,38]. The methodology used by De Leon and colleagues [29] involves spiking a small sample with a large

Page 2 of 12

amount of genetically homologous material to confirm
the polyribosomal nature of the RNA molecules being
studied. However, the inability to distinguish between
the spike and the sample prevented identification of
oocyte/embryo mRNA molecules. In contrast, the
approach used by Potireddy and colleagues [28] allowed
mRNA identification but could not confirm the polyribosomal nature of the isolated fraction nor exclude the
presence of non-polyribosomal contaminants. We therefore sought to combine the advantages of each method
by devising means of confirming the polyribosomal nature of the extracted mRNAs while maintaining the possibility of identifying them and determining their
relative abundance.

Results
Preparation of the inert carrier

In order to develop a polyribosomal isolation method
that could be performed with very small quantities of
sample material, we used an RNA carrier fraction. Spiking the bovine sample with polyribosomes from a nonhomologous organism (i.e. Drosophila) is helpful as long
as there is a way to prevent interference with downstream transcript identification.
Formaldehyde was used to cross-link RNA and proteins from the drosophila SL2 cell extracts in order to
produce a range of materials that might function as carriers. To determine the optimal concentration of formaldehyde that would provide a useful carrier and minimize
downstream interference, a dose-response experiment
was done. At lower concentrations (i.e. 0.2% and 0.37%),
cross-linking was slight, as indicated by the recovery of
almost all of the initial RNA in sucrose density gradient
fractions. At a concentration of 1% formaldehyde,
approximately 10% of the RNA could be recovered
while at the highest concentration tested (3.37%), less
than 1% of the initial RNA input could be recovered
(Figure 1A). The micro-electrophoretic profile confirmed the extremely low level of RNA recovered following the 3.37% formaldehyde treatment (Figure 1B-C).
This latter treatment was used and an additional step
was included to neutralize excess formaldehyde prior to
adding the SL2 cell carrier polysome preparation to the
experimental samples.
Glycine, used routinely to titrate free formaldehyde
and used in this study at the commonly used concentration of 0.1 M [39] was not entirely effective at neutralizing this cross-linking agent (Figure 2A). Since
tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane molecule (THAM or
Tris) has been suggested for this purpose [40], tests
were conducted to determine the conditions under
which it would efficiently inactivate residual formaldehyde in SL2 cell extract. The impact of pH was also
tested since polyribosome extraction was done at a

lower pH than in the Sutherland study. The impact of pH
was found not significant (Figure 2B). At a concentration
of 0.5 M, Tris was found comparable to 0.1 M glycine
and thus could not be considered more efficient. At concentrations of 1 M and 1.5 M, Tris did neutralize the
residual formaldehyde completely (Figures 2B and 2C).
Figure 3 shows the effect of the RNA carrier preparation
protocol on the distribution of polyribosomes in the
sucrose density gradient fractions of the Drosophila SL2
cell extract. The crosslinking treatment did not interfere
with polyribosome profiling as both treated and control
samples show very similar profiles (Figure 3).

Validation of the polyribosomal nature of the
isolated RNA

Since polyribosomes are stabilized by Mg2+ ions, addition
of EDTA causes their dissociation into ribosomal subunits
and the release of messenger RNA. Cytoplasmic extracts
were therefore fractionated in the presence or absence of
EDTA. In order to observe this in the absence of the Drosophila polyribosome preparation, a suitable quantity of
granulosa cells was processed. Standard RT-PCR of genes
ACTB (for granulose cells) and CDK1 (for oocytes) was
used as means of comparing RNA abundance in the collected fractions. For the two cell types, the presence of

threshold. In spite of its phylogenetic distance from cattle, Drosophila RNA generated one third of positive
spots that bovine RNA did at 55°C. Increasing the hybridization temperature by 5°C resulted in a significant loss
in Drosophila positive signals and at 65°C, no Drosophila signal above background was detected. However,
at 65°C, almost half of the bovine signals were also lost.
The intermediate temperature seemed to be an acceptable compromise since only 6% of the spots generated
positive, but very weak signals from Drosophila samples,
while the fluorescence values from the bovine samples
were still clearly above background. By comparison to
the least stringent condition (55°C), 77% (47/61) of the
bovine signals were kept when microarrays were hybridized at 60°C (Table 1).
Reproducibility of the polyribosome RNA extraction
method

We tested the reproducibility of the entire method by
comparing the results obtained from biological replicates. Three oocyte pools were thus fractionated and
analyzed separately using the density gradient method
and microarray hybridization. The mean correlation
value was found to be 0.95 ± 0.01, which clearly indicates that the procedure is robust (Figure 5).

conditions

EDTA caused a shift in RNA abundance towards the fractions containing low sedimentation coefficient materials,
thus confirming the polyribosomal nature of the higher
sedimenting fractions (Figure 4).
Interference of Drosophila polyribosome RNA with
microarray hybridization signals

Interference by the exogenous carrier RNA with the
density-gradient fractionation of the oocyte RNA was
minimal. We decided to determine if this was true for
microarray hybridization signals. Samples prepared from
purified bovine oocyte RNA and from purified Drosophila SL2 RNA were labelled with different fluorophores
and hybridized on the same microarray. Table 1 summarizes the proportion of microarray features that generated positive fluorescent signals above the background

The polyribosome fractionation protocol was tested with
oocytes at different stages of maturation using microarray hybridization to measure the abundance of RNA
sequences representing known key factors in the control
of oocyte maturation. Quantitative RT-PCR was used
since probes for some of the chosen factors were absent
on our microarray. The selected sequences correspond
to components of maturation promoting factor, namely
cyclin B1 (CCNB1), cyclin-dependant kinase 1 (CDK1)
and Moloney sarcoma oncogne (MOS), which is part of
the cytostatic factor required at the MII stage. Total
RNA (targeted using random primers during the RT
reaction), poly(A) (targeted using an oligo-dT during
RT) and polyribosomal sub-fractions were measured.
The abundance of these RNA types varied significantly
between the different tissue types (Figure 6), indicating
clearly that the stage of maturation of the oocyte sample
has an impact on the distribution of the RNA.
Potential implications for protein levels

Since mRNA associated with polyribosomes is presumed
actively translated, levels of protein corresponding to
the selected factors were measured. Microarray gene
entries corresponding to polypeptide sequences for
which commercial antibodies were available were
selected. Standard housekeeping candidates ACTB and

from GV-stage oocytes. Top of gradient corresponds to fraction 1.

TUBA were used as internal standards. Due to the
requirement of oocyte maturation for extensive reorganization of the cytoskeleton, these standard housekeeping candidates were found to be unstable and were
therefore considered solely as a control of sample loading and not used for data normalization. The fluctuations in polyribosomal mRNA levels observed between
maturation stages closely matched protein levels for all
candidates, as shown in Figure 7.

suited to handling minute quantities of material. For
instance, protein profiling and identification of differentially expressed candidates requires several hundreds to
thousands of mammalian oocytes or early embryos
[41-44]. Similarly, these tissues do not provide a much
better source of RNA considering for example that a
single Xenopus oocyte contains about 6 μg of total RNA
[29] comparatively to only 340 pg in the bovine [20].
Nonetheless, the wide array of amplification procedures
now available has made it possible to focus on the

Discussion
The need to develop a procedure for isolating and
studying polyribosomal mRNAs from mammalian
gametes and early embryos arose from the peculiarity of
these cells. The collection of mammalian oocytes and
early stage embryos is challenging and resource-intensive. Therefore, samples rarely contain more than 100
oocytes/embryos. Their scarcity imposes a method

transcriptome rather than the proteome. Study of the
transcriptome generally assumes that mRNA levels are
indicative of cellular status and reflect corresponding
protein levels. However, this assumption does not apply
to cells containing large amounts of stored mRNA, such
as mammalian oocytes and early blastomeres. In these
cases, mRNA bound to polyribosomes and therefore
likely being translated is considered a better indicator of
gene activity and developmental stage.
The first important step for polyribosomal RNA
extraction is thorough lysis of the cells. The greatest difficulty encountered when working with oocytes or prehatching embryos is the challenge of breaking down the

Page 6 of 12

zona pellucida. This porous glycoprotein coat is composed of a dense net of fibril bundles that evolves during oocyte maturation and fertilization [45]. The bovine
zona pellucida is particularly resistant, with a thickness
averaging 26.9 μm compared to 14.5 μm for ovine and
11.4 μm for murine oocytes [46]. Since the lysis buffer
used in the polyribosome isolation procedure is relatively mild to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane and
liberate intact polyribosomes, an additional treatment
was required to efficiently disrupt the sturdy zona pellucida to liberate the cellular contents. We found that
freeze/thaw cycles, effective for mouse oocytes [38], are
ineffective against the bovine zona pellucida and that
digestion with pronase produced irreproducible results
due to residual protease activity. The previously used
acidic (pH 2.1 to 2.5) Tyrode buffer [37] was also tested,
but changes in the granular appearance of the oocyte
cytoplasm suggested disruption of the cytoskeleton, to
which polyribosomes are believed to be bound [47].
Moreover, removal of the zona pellucida by acidic treatment has been reported to lead to embryo death and
increased frequency of abnormalities in surviving
embryos [48], suggesting damage to the embryo development program in which polyribosomes are involved.
The only acceptable option appeared to be mechanical
breakage of the zona with zirconia-silica beads in the
presence of passive lysis buffer (Additional File 1). This
approach seemed to work since the zona and its contents were completely dissolved within a few minutes.
To our knowledge, extraction of polyribosomes from
oocytes and early embryos has been reported only twice
[37,38]. In the first case, mouse liver polyribosomes acted
as a carrier of polyribosomal mRNA extracted from [3H]uridine-labelled mouse oocytes. This attractive method
allows confirmation of the presence of oocyte polyribosomes, but does not allow any identification or even relative quantification of the associated mRNA, since it
cannot be distinguished from that of the liver polyribosomes. The second study involved a method that allowed
identification of the transcripts but could not confirm
their polyribosomal nature nor exclude the presence of
non-polyribosomal contaminants.
We have developed a method in which a heterologous
carrier is used and which allows identification of
extracted mRNA and confirmation of its polysomal nature. This involved determining optimal conditions for
cross-linking the exogeneous polyribosomes. UV crosslinking was incomplete and prolonging the exposure led
to RNA fragmentation (Additional File 2). Formaldehyde
cross-linking, which binds more specifically via free
amino groups [49] was found more effective than UV.
Before adding the carrier preparation to the biological
sample, it was necessary to neutralize the excess formaldehyde, which is normally done with glycine. A recent

Scantland et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/8

study of the efficiency of glycine suggests using stronger
nucleophiles such as Tris or lowering the solution pH as
quick and efficient means of quenching residual formaldehyde [40]. Tris was the preferred option, since it was
not clear that lowering the pH would neutralize the formaldehyde without damaging the polyribosomes.
Using the method described here, the polyribosomal
nature of the isolated bovine RNA can be inferred from
its position in the sucrose gradient. Further validation
was obtained using EDTA to disrupt the polyribosomes
by sequestering Mg2+. The shift observed in the abundance of the amplified CDK1 fragment towards lower
density fractions following this disruption is indicative
of the polyribosomal nature of the bovine mRNA in the
higher density fractions.
The strength of the approach used here was assessed
by quantifying the abundance of selected mRNA of
genes known to be involved in oocyte maturation. Following the luteinizing hormone surge, the oocyte
resumes meiosis and undergoes a sequence of events
involving germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), first
polar body extrusion and a second arrest at the metaphase of the second meiosis (MII) in preparation for fertilization. It is known that maturation promoting factor
(MPF), a heterodimer composed of cyclin B1 (CCNB1)
and cyclin-dependant kinase 1 (CDK1, formerly known
as p34 cdc2 ), must be activated for meiosis to resume.
Once meiosis reaches the MII stage, the role of the CSF
is to halt cell cycle until the ovule is fertilized (For
reviews, see [50,51]). We previously observed that in
cattle, the GV-stage oocyte lacks the CCNB1 component
but contains the CDK1 protein [52]. For activation of
MPF, CCNB1 must be translated immediately after
meiosis resumes but before germinal vesicle breakdown.
Consistent with these observations, CCNB1 mRNA was
found in the polyribosomal fraction at the GV stage, in
addition to CDK1 mRNA. CSF is activated during a
later stage of oocyte maturation prior to its involvement
in arresting the cell cycle. However, it has been found
that MOS is expressed readily during early stages of
oocyte maturation, since it is involved in CCNB1 accumulation and displays an MPF stabilizing activity at the
MII stage [53]. Following fertilization, both the MPF
and CSF are rapidly degraded. Consistent with the activation of MPF, our results showed that levels of CDK1
mRNA and CCNB1 mRNA present on polyribosomes
increased during the initial step of maturation while
MOS, known to be involved throughout oocyte maturation, was equally present at all stages. This physiologically relevant profile was not observed when targeting
total or poly(A)-bearing RNA. This is a strong confirmation that transcript abundance measured as total maternal mRNA pool need to be interpreted with care due to

Page 7 of 12

the contribution of the large contents of stored thus
physiologically inert mRNAs.
Finally, we also investigated the proportionality
between specific polyribosomal mRNAs and their corresponding protein products. By definition, polyribosomal
RNA encodes protein to be newly synthesized. In contrast, the protein content of a candidate results from
both its synthesis and turnover rates. Nevertheless, of
the three mRNA sequences studied in parallel by Western blot, all showed a shift in total protein that
matched the shift in their polyribosomal status, confirming the added value of polyribosome-bound mRNA studies in terms of physiological information.

Conclusions
The study of oocyte maturation and early development
faces a major challenge regarding the physiological relevance of the abundance of total RNA or even poly(A)
RNA. The presence of stored and hence inactive maternal RNA that marks developmental stages prior to
embryonic genome activation can bias the subsequent
interpretation of these measurements. We provide evidence that the study of polyribosomal mRNA offers a
better option for studying the physiology underlying
gametes and embryonic development especially when
the cells are bearing large amounts of stored RNA. The
procedure developed in the present study was shown to
be robust and efficient for isolating polyribosomal
mRNA from small amounts of cells. This polyribosomal
mRNA can then be used for downstream transcriptomic
studies.

Oocyte recovery and selection

Germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were produced as
described previously [54] from bovine ovaries collected
at a commercial slaughterhouse and transported to the
laboratory in a saline solution containing antimycotic
agent. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COC) selected on
the basis of having at least five layers of cumulus were
washed three times in HEPES-buffered Tyrode’s medium supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2
mM pyruvic acid and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Groups of
approximately 50 COCs were placed in four-well Petri
dishes containing 0.5 ml of maturation medium (composed of modified synthetic oviductal fluid medium with
0.8% bovine serum albumin, modified Eagle’s medium

and 1 μg/ml 17b-estradiol) under 0.5 ml of mineral oil.
Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and metaphase II
(MII) oocytes were obtained by incubating COCs at
38.5°C with 5% CO 2 for 6 and 24 hours respectively.
Maturation was stopped upon transfer to PBS-cycloheximide. Cumulus cells were removed by vortexing the tissue in PBS containing 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide to
prevent translation and ribosome run off. The denuded
oocytes were washed at least three times with PBScycloheximide to remove any remaining cumulus cells.
Groups of 75 GV, GVBD or MII oocytes collected for
polyribosomal extraction were separated from the PBScycloheximide by centrifugation at low speed.
Carrier preparation

Since a single bovine GV oocyte, even though enriched
with stored RNA, may contain as little as 340 pg of total
RNA [20] and polyribosomal mRNA represents only a
small fraction of this total, conventional extraction
methods for obtaining a UV-distribution profile on
sucrose density gradient would require an unobtainable
number of oocytes. We therefore devised an inert polyribosome support to serve as a marker and carrier in
the sucrose gradient, allowing us to observe the distribution of single ribosomes and polyribosomes. RNA
extracted from drosophila SL2 cells was used as a carrier because of its phylogenetic distance from cattle.
SL2 cells were cultured at 28°C in complete Schneider’s Drosophila Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum
(Hyclone, Logan, UT), 50 U/ml penicillin G and 50 μg/ml

streptomycin sulphate (Invitrogen). To enhance translation and therefore increase the number of polyribosomes,
these cells were starved for 3 hours in serum-free medium
then stimulated for at least 150 min by adding 33% of
fresh medium and 6.25% of heat-inactivated foetal calf
serum to the medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 3 min at 4°C in the presence of 100
μg/ml cycloheximide and lysed in polyribosome lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.7, 150 mM KCl, 1.25 mM
MgCl2, 1% IGEPAL, 0.5% deoxycholate, 200 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1000 U/ml Protector™ RNase inhibitor (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN) supplemented with complete mini
EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN) followed by triturating. The homogenate
was then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20
min at 4°C and the absorbance of the supernatant was
measured at 260 nm using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, USA). For each
cross-linking test described below, clarified cytoplasmic
extract was prepared from 8 × 106 cells.
Chemical cross-linking of Drosophila polyribosomes

Formaldehyde was added to clarified cytoplasmic extract
to give final concentrations of 0.2% to 3.37%. All crosslinking was done on ice for 45 min. Residual formaldehyde was neutralized by adding 0.1 M glycine [39] or
Tris-HCl at concentrations of 0.15 M to 1.5 M with the
pH adjusted to 8.7 or 10.9, followed by 20 min on ice.
Each cross-linked and neutralized extract was then processed through the steps designed for isolation of polyribosomes from the gradient fractions. Cytoplasmic

Scantland et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:8

samples were mixed with guanidium isothiocyanate
solution and the RNA fraction was ethanol precipitated
overnight. The pellet was further purified by column
chromatography (PicoPure, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cross-linking efficiency was based on the
yield of total RNA thus recovered. It was expected that
with increased cross-linkage, more RNA would be covalently bound to and eluted with the protein fraction.
The RNA-containing fraction eluted from the column
was analyzed using a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA). To determine if the formaldehyde-treated
material retained the potential to generate a normal
polyribosomal fractionation profile, it was subjected to
isokinetic sedimentation in sucrose density gradient as
described below and the generated UV profile distribution was compared to one from an untreated sample.
Oocyte sample preparation

Since the polyribosome lysis buffer is unable to dissolve
the bovine zona pellucida, oocytes were strongly vortexed with 1.0 mm zirconia-silica beads (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK) in 50 μl of passive lysis buffer (Additional
File 1). The lysis product was transferred to a clean
Eppendorf tube and the beads were discarded. Cell debris were removed by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for
20 min. The clarified solution was added to 100 μl of
drosophila carrier. Each sample was loaded on a 4 ml
linear sucrose gradient.
Sucrose gradient preparation and centrifugation

The linear sucrose gradient was generated using a SG-15
gradient maker (Hoefer, Holliston, MA, USA) following
the manufacturer’s instructions with 10% and 60% solutions of sucrose in isotonic buffer made of 150 mM KCl,
1.25 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM Tris adjusted to pH 8.7. The
linear gradients were kept at 4°C until use. Cytoplasmic
extracts were analyzed by sedimentation velocity in the
sucrose gradients for 3 h at 34,000 rpm using a SW 60 Ti
rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The gradients
were processed using a BR-188 Density Gradient Fractionation System (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Fractions of 350 μl were collected with continuous monitoring
of absorbance at 254 nm using an Isco UA-6 detector
(Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, NE, USA). The RNA-containing
fractions were collected directly in 428 μl of 5.25 M guanidinium thiocyanate (pH 5.5) and 3 μl (5 μg/μl) of linear
polyacrylamide (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA) were added
to each as an RNA co-precipitant. Isopropanol was then
added and the samples were left overnight at -20°C. The
polyribosome-containing RNA precipitate thus obtained
was then re-suspended in the extraction buffer provided
with the RNA extraction PicoPure kit (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and RNA content was assayed
using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. The

polyribosomal nature of the isolated fractions was verified
by adding 100 mM of EDTA to the lysis buffer and the
sucrose gradient solutions to sequester Mg2+ and thereby
disrupt any polyribosomes.
Microarrays

The hybridizations were performed on the custom-made
BlueChip v1.3 cDNA microarray. This microarray contains 1153 expressed sequence tags collected from four
subtracted libraries made from oocytes and early
embryos [55]. For the determination of the optimal
microarray hybridization temperature to avoid potential
contamination from the carrier (Table 1) two technical
replicates were performed for each tested temperature.
To test the reproducibility of the polyribosomal isolation, six hybridization samples were prepared representing three biological replicates each performed in dye
swap (two technical replicates). To test the method in a
biological context (Figures 6 and 7), for each maturation
stage, two biological replicates each containing 75
oocytes were used to generate hybridization samples. A
total of 12 microarrays were hybridized including a
technical replicate for each sample.
RNA samples were amplified through two rounds of
in vitro transcription using the RiboAmp kit (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Yields of antisense RNA
were assayed on the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. For each microarray hybridization sample, 10
μg of antisense RNA was labelled using the ULS aRNA
labelling kit (Kreatech, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
To obtain more concentrated and cleaner output, PicoPure columns (Molecular Devices) were used for aRNA
purification. The resulting labelled purified probes were
heat-denatured at 90°C for 5 min and 50 μl of SlideHyb
buffer #1 (Ambion) was immediately added. The slides
were hybridized in the SlideBooster hybridization chamber (Advalytix, San Francisco, CA, USA) at the tested
temperature for 18 h. Slides were washed twice in lowstringency buffer (2× standard saline citrate (SSC)/0.5%
sodium dodecyl sulphate) for 15 min at 60°C. Washes
were repeated with high-stringency buffer (0.5× SSC/
0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate) in the same conditions.
Slides were then dipped three times in SSC 1× followed
by three more dips in H2O, spun for 5 min at 1,200 × g
at room temperature and scanned using a VersArray
ChipReader (Virtek, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada)
supported by VersArray software (Bio-Rad).
Signal intensity and local background were determined
with Array-Pro Analyzer Ver4.5 (Media Cybernetics,
Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated based on net signal intensities of
probes on the microarray that generated positive signals.
The same approach was used to determine the optimal
microarray hybridization temperature (Table 1). Positive

Scantland et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/8

signal threshold values were determined based on a net
intensity cut-off value calculated from the background
values + 2 standard deviations. For microarrays, data
was pre-processed: 1) background was subtracted; 2)
intra-array normalization was performed using Loess; 3)
inter-array normalization was performed using Quantile.
RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted using PicoPure columns
(Molecular Devices). An on-column DNase 1 treatment
was performed. The resulting RNA samples were reverse
transcribed using the qScript Flex cDNA synthesis kit
(Quanta, Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The
reaction was primed using either an oligo dT (for poly
(A) and polyribosomal RNA) or with random primers to
target all mRNAs regardless of poly(A) length, in a total
reaction volume of 20 μl. For PCR, primer sequences
and details are listed in Table 2.
For standard PCR (Figure 4), the distribution was
repeated twice from biologically independent samples.
The NovaTaq DNA Polymerase (EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ, USA) was used and the amplification conditions
were as follows: Hot start cycle, 10 min at 95°C; 30 PCR
cycles (denaturing: 94°C for 30 sec; annealing: 60°C for 30
sec; extension: 72°C for 1 min) followed by a last 10 min
extension at 72°C. The PCR products were loaded onto
1.5% agarose gel for migration.
For quantitative PCR, four biologically independent
replicates were processed for all treatments and time
points. A standard curve was generated using the template from a PCR product purified using the QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada)
and quantified with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. The standard curve consisted of five serial dilutions of the purified PCR products ranging from 0.1 pg
to 0.01 fg. Quantification was achieved using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. All reactions were conducted
in a LightCycler 1.5 (Roche Diagnostics). Primer annealing and fluorescence acquisition temperatures are listed
in Table 2. Specificity of amplification was determined

Page 10 of 12

by sequencing the amplicon for each target and by the
presence of a single peak on the melting curve. Data
normalization could only be accounted by using samples
containing the same amount of oocytes. Since quantifications were performed on different RNA populations
(i.e. total RNA, poly(A) bearing and polyribosomal
mRNA), data normalization could not be performed
across these groups. Furthermore, usual housekeeping
gene candidates could not be used for data normalization across oocyte maturation stages since their respective transcript abundance been reported to be
fluctuating [56,57]. As a consequence, absolute transcript measurements were considered where total variance includes both technical and biological variances.
Western blot analysis

Oocytes were frozen in groups of 25 in a minimal
volume (1-3 μl) of PBS and stored at -80°C. Three pools
of each maturation stage were re-suspended in 2×
sodium dodecyl sulphate gel loading buffer (100 mM
Tris-Cl, 4% w/v sodium dodecyl sulphate, 0,2% w/v bromophenol blue, 20% v/v glycerol, 10% b-mercaptoethanol) and heated to 95°C prior to loading. The samples
were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(NitroBind Cast) using the wet transfer method and
transferred proteins stained with Ponceau S red. The
membranes were processed for immunoreactions with
the primary antibody overnight at 4°C then with secondary antibody under the following conditions: STAT3
(no. 9132, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA,
USA) diluted 1/1,000 - goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish
peroxidase diluted 1/200,000; GSTM3 (no. 74749,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) diluted 1/2,500 - goat
anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase diluted
1/100,000; DTX2 (no. 101938, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1/100,000 - anti-rabbit
diluted 1/100,000; PTTG1 (no. 3305, Abcam) diluted 1/
2,500 - anti-mouse diluted 1/40,000. Each candidate was
immunoblotted in parallel with the usual housekeeping
genes: b-actin (no. 4967, Cell Signaling Technology)
diluted 1/10,000 - anti-rabbit diluted 1/200,000 or

a-tubulin (Santa Cruz biotechnology 33999, diluted 1/
250) - rabbit anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase
(diluted 1/200,000)). Determination of the housekeeping
gene products was done according to the molecular
weight of the protein of interest to avoid overlapping
signals. All secondary antibodies came from Invitrogen.
Protein expression levels were quantified using GeneTools software (Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA).
Statistical analysis and microarray data processing

Significant differences were calculated using SAS software (SAS-Institute inc., Cary, NC). One-way ANOVA
with Dunnett tests were conducted for all cross-linking
tests by using standard extraction as control. Differences
were considered statistically significant (*) at the 95%
confidence level (P < 0.05) and highly significant (**) at
the 99% confidence level (P < 0.01). For Figure 6, RNA
abundance data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA
using Tukey’s multiple comparison test. For Figure 7,
protein and polyribosomal RNA levels were analysed
with two-way ANOVA since interrelation between both
are expected. Data with different letters are significantly
different (P < 0.05). When ANOVA criteria were not
met (normality and homogeneity of variance), data were
transformed to logarithms.
For microarrays, statistical testing was conducted
using the statistical significance test from Limma using
a Web-based tool, WebArray DB (http://www.webarraydb.org/webarray/index.html). Only candidates with
statistically significantly different signal (p < 0.05) and
with at least a twofold change were selected.

apparatus (Hoefer, Holliston, MA) at a distance of 5 cm using the
maximum intensity setting. Samples were removed at different exposure
times and mixed with the guanidium isothiocyanate solution used for
RNA extraction.
