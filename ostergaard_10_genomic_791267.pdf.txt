Abstract
Background: Several novel immunoglobulin-like transcripts (NILTs) which have previously been identified in the
salmonid species rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) contain either one or two extracellular Ig domains of the
V-type. NILTs also possess either an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM) or immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic region resulting in different signalling abilities. Here we
report for the first time the genomic organisation and structure of the multigene family of NILTs in Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar) using a BAC sequencing approach.
Results: We have identified six novel Atlantic salmon NILT genes (Ssa-NILT1-6), two pseudogenes (Ssa-NILTp1 and
Ssa-NILTp2) and seven genes encoding putative transposable elements in one BAC covering more than 200 kbp.
Ssa-NILT1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 contain one Ig domain, all having a CX3C motif, whereas Ssa-NILT3 contains two Ig
domains, having a CX6C motif in Ig1 and a CX7C motif in Ig2. Atlantic salmon NILTs possess several ITIMs in the
cytoplasmic region and the ITIM-bearing exons are in phase 0. A comparison of identity between the amino acid
sequences of the CX3C Ig domains from NILTs varies from 77% to 96%. Ssa-NILT1, 2, 3 and 4 were all confirmed to
be expressed either by their presence in EST databases (Ssa-NILT1) or RT-PCR (Ssa-NILT2, 3, and 4) using cDNA as
template. A survey of the repertoire of putative NILT genes in a single individual revealed three novel genes (SsaNILT7-9) represented by the Ig domain, which together with Ig domains from Ssa-NILT1-6 could be divided into
different groups based on specific motifs.
Conclusions: This report reveals a tightly clustered, multigene NILT family in Atlantic salmon. By screening a highly
redundant Atlantic salmon BAC library we have identified and characterised the genomic organisation of six genes
encoding NILT receptors. The genes show similar characteristics to NILTs previously identified in rainbow trout,
having highly conserved cysteines in the Ig domain and several inhibitory signalling motifs in the cytoplasmic
region. In a single individual three unique NILT Ig domain sequences were discovered at the genomic DNA level,
which were divided into two different groups based on a four residue motif after the third cysteine. Our results
from the BAC screening and analysis on the repertoire of NILT genes in a single individual indicates that many
genes of this expanding Ig containing NILT family are still to be discovered in fish.

Background
Disease control and health is central to the production
of salmon in aquaculture and more knowledge of the
immune system in fish might help prevent infectious
disease outbreaks. Salmon inhabit a temperate environment and their adaptive immune system is not as rapid
as in mammals. Therefore, they rely to a greater degree
on the innate immune system to combat pathogens [1].
A wide range of activating and inhibitory receptors play
a role in the innate immune system, of which many are
expressed on neutrophils, macrophages and natural
killer (NK) cells. These receptors recognise conserved
pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
released from or found on the surface of pathogens [2],
and result in the activation of responsive cells. Many of
these cell-surface receptors contain immunoglobulin-like
(Ig) domains [3] and several genes have been found in
clusters such as the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC)
[4] and the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
cells (TREM) cluster [5] in mammals. The LRC is a very
gene dense region, spanning 1 Mb, which includes the
killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs), leukocyte Ig-like
receptors (LILRs) and the natural cytotoxicity receptor
(NCR) NKp46 [6]. The TREM cluster on human chromosome 6 harbours genes such as TREM1 and 2, as
well as the NCR named NKp44 [5,7]. TREM receptors
are involved in the amplification and attenuation of the
inflammatory response [8,9], while the NKp44 receptor
activates NK cells [10]. All these receptors are type I
transmembrane proteins characterised by the presence
of a variable number of extra-cellular Ig domains of
either the C2-type or the novel V-type [10,11]. The Ig
domains are usually followed by a connecting peptide, a
transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. Some
inhibitory receptors have a long cytoplasmic region containing one or more immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) [12], which block NK cellmediated cytotoxicity [13,14]. The cytoplasmic regions
of activating receptors are short and associate with
adaptor molecules such as DAP12, CD3ζ or FcεRIg via a
positively charged residue (arginine or lysine) in their
transmembrane region. These adaptor proteins contain
a negatively charged residue in their transmembrane
region and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating
motif (ITAM) in their cytoplasmic region [15].
In several species of teleost fish, receptors belonging
to the Ig super family (IgSF) have been reported. These
include the novel immune-type receptors (NITRs)
reported in Southern pufferfish [16], zebrafish [17],
channel catfish [18], rainbow trout [19], Japanese flounder [20] and sea bass [21], and the novel immunoglobulin-like transcript (NILT) genes described in carp [22]
and rainbow trout [23,24]. Most NITRs possess a V-type

Page 2 of 13

Ig domain and most of them also have a second Ig
domain of the V/C2-type followed by a transmembrane
and cytoplasmic region. The majority of NITRs contain
an ITIM, whereas a few contain an ITAM instead.
NILT receptors have either one or two extracellular Ig
domains, a connecting peptide, a transmembrane region,
and a cytoplasmic region containing the signalling
motifs, and are expressed mainly in lymphoid tissues
[23,24]. Homology modelling has indicated that these
receptors have an extra-cellular Ig domain structurally
similar to the V-type Ig domain of human NKp44. In
carp, the NILT genes were shown to belong to a multigene family and analysis of the NILT Ig-encoding
sequences revealed extensive haplotypic and allelic polymorphism [22]. Several NILT genes have been characterized in rainbow trout [24] suggesting the multigene
status of NILT in salmonids. These observations
prompted us to investigate the genomic organization
and structure of NILT genes in Atlantic salmon using a
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. This
paper describes the first study on NILT in Atlantic salmon and reveals the genomic organization of several
NILT genes in a single BAC clone sequence. In addition,
the analysis shows that these NILT genes are tightly
clustered in Atlantic salmon, with Ig domains structurally related to the novel V-type Ig domain of NKp44
and containing inhibitory signalling motifs.

Results
Identification and gene organization of NILTs in Atlantic
salmon

Two partial NILT sequences [GenBank:DW550613,
GenBank:DW564289] [25], from Atlantic salmon were
used to design a 40-mer oligonucleotide probe located
in the Ig domain. The probe hybridised to several BAC
clones located within contig 341 in the physical map of
the Atlantic salmon genome generated based on HindIII
fingerprinting (Figure 1) [26], http://www.asalbase.org,
of which one (S0024B13) was selected for shotgun
sequencing. A continuous sequence of 149,704 bp was
obtained after shotgun sequencing, contig assembling
and gap closing using specific primers located in the
contig ends [GenBank:GU552297]. Examination of this
region (contig 4) identified four full-length NILT genes
(Ssa-NILT1, Ssa-NILT2, Ssa-NILT3 and Ssa-NILT4) and
one partial NILT gene (Ssa-NILT5). In the neighbouring
contig 3 (size 35,964 bp) the putative 5’end of SsaNILT5 was identified as well as a predicted Ssa-NILT6.
The NILT genes are orientated in both 3’ and 5’ directions in the BAC clone sequence (Figure 2). The open
reading frames (ORF) of the genes containing one Ig
domain are; Ssa-NILT1 (1032 bp), Ssa-NILT2 (993 bp),
Ssa-NILT4 (1062 bp), Ssa-NILT5 (933 bp) and

domains, and containing an additional intron in phase 1.
The phases of the introns are highly conserved.
The Ig domains of all the Ssa-NILTs are of the V-type
and contain the characteristic cysteines at positions 17
and 89 responsible for disulphide bridge formation
(Figure 4). Additional cysteines separated by three
amino acids (CX3 C) are present in the Ig domains of
Ssa-NILT1, Ssa-NILT2, Ssa-NILT4, Ssa-NILT5 and SsaNILT6 whereas they are separated by six amino acids
(CX6C) in the Ig1 domain of Ssa-NILT3. In the second
Ig domain of Ssa-NILT3 they are separated by seven
amino acids (CX7C). These cysteines may form a second
disulphide bridge. The connecting peptide of Ssa-NILT1
contains a high number of serine/threonine residues,
29/56 respectively. Twenty-three serine residues were
identified using the NetPhos server 2.0 http://www.cbs.
dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/ in the connecting peptide of

Ssa-NILT1 to be potential phophorylation sites (data
not shown). This high proportion of serine and threonine residues is also observed in the connecting peptide
of Ssa-NILT2-6 with 22/45, 15/33, 36/68, 22/38 and 20/
37 residues, respectively (Figure 4). In addition, the
Shannon entropy (H; http://imed.med.ucm.es/PVS/) was
calculated for the Ssa-NILT sequences. Positions with H
values above 1.3 are considered to be variable, while
those with H values smaller than 1.3 are identified as
conserved. The Shannon plot revealed that amino acid
positions in the Ig domain and in the connecting peptide of the deduced NILT proteins could be considered
as variable (Figure 4). The cytoplasmic regions of NILTs
in Atlantic salmon range in size from 332 to 377 residues and the percentage of identity between the NILTs
varies from 63% to 84% at the amino acid level. The
NILTs have either four or five inhibitory motifs in the

ITIMs (S/I/V/LxYxxI/V/L or YxxI/V/L) (Figure 4).
These correspond to the NILTs found in rainbow trout,
which also contain several inhibitory signalling motifs
[24]. Ssa-NILT1, Ssa-NILT2, Ssa-NILT3, and Ssa-NILT4
were all confirmed to be expressed either by their
presence in EST databases http://web.uvic.ca/grasp (SsaNILT1) or RT-PCR (Ssa-NILT2, Ssa-NILT3, and SsaNILT4) using cDNA as template and primers listed in

was amplified using genomic DNA as template. However, the primers used for amplifying a specific product
representing Ssa-NILT6 were very difficult to design due
to high similarity between NILT genes in the BAC
sequence.
A pseudogene, Ssa-NILTp1, was identified between
nucleotide position 6197 and 22738 in the BAC clone
sequence (contig 4), comprising a leader peptide, two
putative Ig domains, a connecting peptide, a transmembrane region and part of the cytoplasmic region (Figure 2).
The pseudo gene contained a stop codon at nucleotide
position 7013 in the Ig1 domain immediately after the last
cysteine. Another pseudogene, Ssa-NILTp2, orientated in
the reverse direction was identified between nucleotide
position 49770 and 54621 in the same contig. Ssa-NILTp2
consists of a leader peptide and one Ig domain followed by
the initial part of a second Ig domain, a transmembrane
region and the cytoplasmic tail. An exon coding for the
connecting peptide was not identified suggesting that it
may not function as a true NILT. Two additional Ig
domains, nucleotide position 83454 to 83746 and 122661
to 122780 were also discovered in contig 31, both of them
containing either a stop codon or a nucleotide deletion
interrupting the reading frame.
Intron 3 from Ssa-NILT3 is large (>11 kbp) and contained a conserved domain belonging to the reverse
transcriptase (RT) superfamily. GENSCAN predictions
[27] and BLASTn [28] searches of the non-redundant
nucleotide database using the BAC clone sequence as
query predicted seven transposable elements (Figure 2)
two of which belong to the piggyBac-like DNA transposon family and one belongs to the Tc1-like transposon
family [29]. The remaining four transposable elements
contained conserved domains belonging to the RT
superfamily.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the amino
acid sequence of the Ig domains of NILTs from Atlantic
salmon, rainbow trout, carp and zebrafish together with
human Ig receptors (Figure 5). It shows a clear division
of Ig1 and Ig2 domains as well as clustering of salmonids and cyprinids.
NILT repertoire in Atlantic salmon

Genomic DNA was extracted from a single individual
and used as template in ten independent PCRs in order
to amplify a specific part of the Ig domain. Ten clones
from each PCR were sequenced and only NILT
sequences observed more than once were included in
the analysis of the repertoire. Eighty one clones were
found positive for NILT resulting in seven different
sequences and 19 singletons at the amino acid level.
Despite using degenerate oligonucleotide primers
designed to amplify Ig domains containing either CX3C

Page 7 of 13

or CX6C motifs (Table 1) only Ig domains containing
CX3C motifs were observed.
Of the seven different sequences retrieved, four were
identical to either Ssa-NILT1, Ssa-NILT2, Ssa-NILT4 or
Ssa-NILT6 at the nucleotide level, leaving three novel Ig
domains of NILTs Ssa-NILT7-9. Multiple alignment of
the amino acid sequences and subsequent phylogenetic
analysis revealed a division of NILT Ig domains into
two different types (Figure 6). Group 1, comprising SsaNILT1, Ssa-NILT2, and Ssa-NILT8, have Ig domains
containing a CX3C motif as well as a histidine residue at
position 20, a SLYY motif located at positions 32 to 35
(immediately after the third cysteine), and a leucine residue at position 66. Group 2, comprising Ssa-NILT4, SsaNILT5, Ssa-NILT6, Ssa-NILT7, and Ssa-NILT9, have Ig
domains also containing a CX 3 C motif, but having a
glutamine residue at position 20, a (P/R)V(F/L)N motif
located from position 32 to 35, and an isoleucine residue at position 66. In the Ig1 domain of Ssa-NILT3,
which contains a CX6C motif, there was a characteristic
glutamine residue at position 20 and the isoleucine residue in position 66. The Ig2 domain, containing a CX7C
motif, is significantly different and was included in the
phylogenetic tree as an out-group.

Discussion
Pattern recognition receptor (PRR) genes encoding the
tertiary structure of an Ig domain belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. These Ig containing receptors
are found throughout the animal kingdom and several
clusters have been identified in mammals [30]. A classic
example is the leukocyte receptor complex, which contains several gene families encoding PRRs having single
or multiple Ig domains [6]. It is hypothesised that they
have evolved through duplication to give a wide array of
Ig-containing PRRs within the innate immune system of
vertebrates in order to recognise potential pathogenic
organisms. In this paper we describe for the first time
the characterisation and genomic organisation of the Igcontaining receptor termed novel immunoglobulin-like
transcript (NILT) in the Atlantic salmon.
Six NILT genes, equally distributed within a BAC
sequence (S0024B13), were identified. In addition, two
pseudogenes as well as two single pseudo Ig domains
and seven transposable elements were identified. Comparison of the genomic organisation revealed a similar
structure for the NILT genes, with the exception of SsaNILT3, which contains an additional Ig domain (Ig2)
encoded by exon 2a followed by a long intron 2a of 11
kbp (Figure 2). The occurrence of a NILT with two Ig
domains was also present in rainbow trout [24],
in which the intron following the Ig2 encoding exon
in Omy-NILT1 has a size of 5.8 kb (Table 2) [23].

However, when examining the equivalent intron in DreNILT1 predicted from zebrafish, it was shown to be
only 362 bp long [24] indicating a more compact gene
structure of NILT genes in cyprinids compared to salmonids. Intron 1 in all Atlantic salmon NILTs, except
for Ssa-NILT2, has the exact same size of 275 nucleotides and showed >96% identity. The remaining introns
differ in length, however, intron 2 and 3 from SsaNILT1 and Ssa-NILT2 also revealed a high percentage
of identity (>95%). Between different teleost species the
sizes of introns and exons are generally highly conserved

(Table 2), implying a close relationship of NILT genes
across species. Comparison of the amino acid sequences
of the Ig encoding exons from Ssa-NILT1 and SsaNILT2 revealed a strikingly high percentage of identity
(96%) (Table 3). In contrast, the percent identity
between the cytoplasmic region encoded by exon 5 and
6 of Ssa-NILT1 and Ssa-NILT2 was only 67%. The lowest percent of identity between Atlantic salmon Ig
domains was seen when comparing Ig1 and Ig2 in SsaNILT3 (26%), which might indicate that NILT receptors
with two Ig domains have a larger repertoire of binding

a rooted phylogenetic tree showing the division into different groups of NILT Ig domains from the Atlantic salmon. The unrooted tree was built

specificities than NILT receptors with one Ig domain. So
far no ligands for the NILT receptor have been identified, but future work will determine if there is any
resemblance to the highly polymorphic KIRs in humans,
which bind another highly polymorphic ligand, namely
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I [31].
Two pseudogenes, Ssa-NILTp1 and Ssa-NILTp2, were
identified in the BAC clone sequence as well as two
separate pseudogenes each encoding a single Ig domain.
The two pseudogenes have many features in common
with Ssa-NILT1-6, but Ssa-NILTp1 contains a stop
codon in the Ig1 domain and exon 5 was absent. SsaNILTp2 contains an Ig1 domain highly similar to the
Ig1 domain of Ssa-NILT3 (99%). The initial part of a
second Ig domain was also identified. However, immediately after the first cysteine in the Ig2 domain encoding
exon, a nucleotide deletion results in a shift of reading
frame. In addition, exon 3 encoding the connecting peptide was absent.
All NILTs identified in the BAC clone sequence contain
several ITIM signalling motifs in the cytoplasmic region

encoded by exon 6. Exons bearing ITIM sequences are
always in phase 0, i.e. the intron-exon boundary does not
interrupt a codon [32]. In addition, many genes belonging
to the immunoglobulin superfamily have exons encoding
the Ig domain that are in phase 1 [33], which is also
observed in the NILT genes from the Atlantic salmon
(Figure 3). Having an ITIM-containing exon in phase 0
implies that the signalling properties of the Ssa-NILT
receptors are functional and phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITIM motif leading to inhibition is
most likely to occur.
The BAC clone analysis resulted in the identification
of several NILTs, which suggests the presence of more
than six NILTs in Atlantic salmon. We carried out a
study using genomic DNA and primers located in conserved regions of the Ig domain. By using this approach
we obtained three novel NILT Ig sequences (Ssa-NILT79) and 19 singletons at the amino acid level out of 81
clones. This implies that NILT genes in Atlantic salmon
are a multigene family of related genes. Interestingly,
none of the 81 clones contained the CX6C motif, which

additional and NILT sequences were discovered at the
genomic DNA level, and allowed division of NILTs into
two different groups based on a four residue motif after
the third cysteine in the Ig domain. Together with
the NILTs from the BAC clone sequence we now know
that multiple NILT genes exist in teleost fish and it will
be interesting to discover if and how they differ
functionally.

suggests that a higher number of genes encoding Ig
domains containing the CX3C motif may be present in
the genome. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis divided the CX3C sequences into two groups, having
different motifs located immediately after the third
cysteine (Figure 6). Group 1 molecules contained
sequences with a SLYY motif and a histidine and leucine
residue at positions 20 and 66, respectively. In contrast,
group 2 molecules contained sequences with a (P/R)V
(F/L)N motif and a glutamine and isoleucine at positions 20 and 66, respectively. The four residue motifs
are located in a loop region between beta-strands C and
C’, when comparing the amino acid sequence to the
sequence of NKp44 [7]. This observation corresponds to
the theory that most variation is detected in loopregions. Future studies will determine if these motifs, as
well as the general allelic polymorphism of NILT genes
seen in a single individual may contribute to different
binding specificities for an as yet unknown ligand. Until
now only a few ligands have been identified for nonrearranging receptors with the most investigated being
the interaction of classical and non-classical MHC class
I molecules to KIRs [34]. NILTs have not been identified in any vertebrates other then teleost to date suggesting that this multigene family of receptors are
involved in the control of immune responses in fish
only and may represent an ancient type of receptor that
has expanded in the fish lineage.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this report reveals a tightly clustered,
multigene family of novel immunoglobulin-like transcripts (NILT) in Atlantic salmon. By screening a highly
redundant Atlantic salmon BAC library we have identified and characterised the genomic organisation of six
genes encoding NILT receptors. The genes show similar
characteristics to NILTs previously identified in rainbow
trout [24] having highly conserved cysteines in the
Ig domain and several inhibitory signalling motifs in
the cytoplasmic region. In a single individual, three

Methods
Screening the Atlantic salmon CHORI-214 BAC library for
NILT genes

The Atlantic salmon bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
library, CHORI-214, was obtained from BACPAC
Resources, Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute
(CHORI), Oakland, CA. The average insert size of the
library is 188 kbp, representing 18-fold genome coverage
[35]. In preparation for screening the library, the filters
were prehybridised for 1 h at 65°C in a solution consisting
of 5×SSC, 5×Denhardt’s solution, and 0.5% SDS. The 40mer oligonucleotide probe (5’ GGAGTGGACAAATGGGGACAAGATAACTACATTAATA3’) used for screening
the library was labelled at the 5’ end with g-32P-ATP using
T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) in a 10 μl volume
reaction and incubated for at least 30 min at 37 C before it
was added to the hybridisation solution. The labelling
reaction included 1 μl of 10 μM probe, 10 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase, 2 μl of 5× forward reaction buffer, 2 μl of
g-32P-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 4 μl of water. The hybridisation solution was as above and to each prehybridised filter
1.6 μl of radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe were
added and the hybridisation was carried out at 65°C overnight (~18 h). Following hybridisation, the filters were
washed three times in 1×SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50°C for 1 h
for each wash. The washed filters were exposed to phosphor screens overnight and scanned using the Typhoon
9410 Phosphor Imager (Amersham Biosciences). The BAC
clones positive by hybridisation were picked from the
library and grown in 5 ml of LB medium containing 20 μg/
ml chloramphenicol for 14-16 h at 37°C with shaking at
250-300 rpm. PCR amplification of the hybridisationpositive clones was performed in a Thermal Cycler (Biometra) using NILT specific primers (Ss-NILT-f: GCAGAGAT
CAGATGCCCCTA, Ss-NILT-r: ATCTTGTCCCCATTTG
TCCA) to determine if these BACs contain sequences corresponding to the NILT gene. All PCR amplifications were
performed in a 25 μl reaction volume using the following
conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min followed
by 35 cycles at 95°C for 45 s, 65°C for 45 s, 72°C for 45 s
and finally one cycle at 72°C for 5 min. For each DNA
amplification, 0.05 U Taq DNA polymerase, 12.5 pmoles of
each primer, 1× PCR buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2,
50 μM of dNTPs and 25 ng of BAC DNA template were
used. The amplification products were analysed by

electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel containing 1×
TBE and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualised using
a UV trans-illuminator (Ultra-Violet Products).
Shotgun sequencing, assembly and annotation of the
BAC S0024B13

Isolation of the BAC DNA and shotgun library construction were carried out as described by Johnstone
et al. [36]. Briefly, the isolated BAC DNA was sheared
by sonication, blunt-end repaired using the End-It™DNA
End-Repair Kit (Epicentre) and size fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The region containing 2 to 5 kb
fragments was excised and gel purified using a Gel Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The fragments were ligated into pUC19
plasmid, which had been cut with SmaI and treated
with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and then used to
transform E. coli XL1 Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Large-scale colony picking was performed using a
QPix-2 colony picker (Genetix) and 2,304 clones were
sent for sequencing at the Michael Smith Genome
Sciences Centre (Vancouver). Base calling and assembling were done using Phred and Phrap [37,38].
Assembled sequences were viewed and edited using
Consed [39].
GENSCAN [27] was used to predict novel genes and
to identify open reading frames. The predicted gene
sequences were analysed for the presence of a leader
peptide using SignalP 3.0 [40] and transmembrane
regions using the TMHMM server 2.0 http://www.cbs.
dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0. Identity as well as similarity with other known sequences was determined
using BLAST-n and BLAST-p [28]. Comparisons
between sequences were performed with Clustal W [41]
and phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis
was conducted using MEGA 4 [42].
Amplification of NILT from Atlantic salmon

Genomic DNA was extracted from an Atlantic salmon
liver using a genomic DNA purification system (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
isolated genomic DNA was used as template in a PCR
with Ss-pan-NILT primers (Table 1).
The reactions were performed in a total volume of
50 μl using 1 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High
Fidelity (Invitrogen) in the presence of 200 nM primer,
250 ng template, 5 μl 10× reaction buffer, 2 mM
MgSO4 and 200 μM dNTPs. The PCR conditions were:
initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min followed by
25 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s, 68°C for 30 s
and finally one cycle at 68°C for 5 min. Atlantic salmon
cDNA synthesised from total RNA isolated from head
kidney, as previously described [24], was used as template in a PCR with primers designed against NILT. The

reactions were performed in a total volume of 50 μl
using 1.25 U GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) in
the presence of 200 nM primer, 300 ng template, 10 μl
5× reaction buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 200 μM dNTPs.
The PCR conditions were: initial denaturation at 95°C
for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C
for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min and finally one cycle at 72°C
for 7 min. All PCR products were visualised on 1.5%
agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and ligated
into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmids were transformed
into chemically competent E. coli cells, RapidTrans™TAM1 (Active Motif) and recombinant clones identified. Plasmid DNA was purified from overnight cell
cultures of recombinant clones using a QIAprep Spin
Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Approximately 1 μg of purified plasmid
DNA was used for sequencing with the vector-specific
primers T7 and SP6 by MWG-Biotech (Germany).
