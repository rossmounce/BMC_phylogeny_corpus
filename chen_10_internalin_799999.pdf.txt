Abstract
Background: Ecological, biochemical and genetic resemblance as well as clear differences of virulence between L.
monocytogenes and L. innocua make this bacterial clade attractive as a model to examine evolution of pathogenicity.
This study was attempted to examine the population structure of L. innocua and the microevolution in the L. innocua-L.
monocytogenes clade via profiling of 37 internalin genes and multilocus sequence typing based on the sequences of 9
unlinked genes gyrB, sigB, dapE, hisJ, ribC, purM, gap, tuf and betL.
Results: L. innocua was genetically monophyletic compared to L. monocytogenes, and comprised four subgroups.
Subgroups A and B correlated with internalin types 1 and 3 (except the strain 0063 belonging to subgroup C) and
internalin types 2 and 4 respectively. The majority of L. innocua strains belonged to these two subgroups. Subgroup A
harbored a whole set of L. monocytogenes-L. innocua common and L. innocua-specific internalin genes, and displayed
higher recombination rates than those of subgroup B, including the relative frequency of occurrence of recombination
versus mutation (ρ/θ) and the relative effect of recombination versus point mutation (r/m). Subgroup A also exhibited
a significantly smaller exterior/interior branch length ratio than expected under the coalescent model, suggesting a
recent expansion of its population size. The phylogram based on the analysis with correction for recombination
revealed that the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of L. innocua subgroups A and B were similar.
Additionally, subgroup D, which correlated with internalin type 5, branched off from the other three subgroups. All L.
innocua strains lacked seventeen virulence genes found in L. monocytogenes (except for the subgroup D strain L43
harboring inlJ and two subgroup B strains bearing bsh) and were nonpathogenic to mice.
Conclusions: L. innocua represents a young species descending from L. monocytogenes and comprises four subgroups:
two major subgroups A and B, and one atypical subgroup D serving as a link between L. monocytogenes and L. innocua
in the evolutionary chain. Although subgroups A and B appeared at approximately the same time, subgroup A seems
to have experienced a recent expansion of the population size with higher recombination frequency and effect than
those of subgroup B, and might represent the possible evolutionary direction towards adaptation to enviroments. The
evolutionary history in the L. monocytogenes-L. innocua clade represents a rare example of evolution towards reduced
virulence of pathogens.
Background
The genus Listeria encompasses six species, which could
be divided into three major phylogenetic clusters: L.

identified within L. monocytogenes strains, with lineage I
including serovars 1/2b, 3b, 4b, 4d, 4e, 4ab and 7, lineage
II covering serovars 1/2a, 3a, 1/2c and 3c, and lineage III
comprising sublineages IIIA, IIIB and IIIC covering serovars 4a, 4c and atypical 4b [3-5]. Of the 13 L. monocytogenes serovars, four (4b, 1/2a, 1/2b and 1/2c) are
responsible for over 98% of human listeriosis cases
whereas other serovars (e.g., 4a and 4c) are seldom implicated in listeriosis [6,7]. L. innocua is of particular significance because it is most closely related to L.
monocytogenes, and they usually co-exist in various environmental, food and clinical specimens [8]. Although
these two species resemble each other ecologically, biochemically and genetically, L. innocua has no pathogenic
inclination [1,9]. Therefore, the L. innocua-L. monocytogenes clade within the genus Listeria can be used as a
model system to examine the evolution of pathogenicity.
Intriguingly, some L. monocytogenes strains tend to lose
virulence factors that play critical roles in infection,
which has been considered as a rare example of evolution
towards reduced virulence of pathogens [4,10]. Certain L.
monocytogenes lineage IIIA strains are presumed to have
identifiable linkage between L. monocytogenes and L.
innocua by possessing many genes common to L. monocytogenes [e.g., Listeria pathogenicity island I (LIPI-1),
inlAB locus, bsh and hpt], and sharing many gene deletions similar to L. innocua (e.g., inlC, inlI, inlJ, internalin
cluster between ascB and dapE, and arginine deiminase
island lmo0036-lmo0041) [11-13]. Therefore, the population structure and biodiversity in L. innocua may, from
the other side of the coin, provide clues for the evolutionary history in the L. monocytogenes-L. innocua clade.
Unfortunately, comprehensive knowledge on the phylogenetic structure of L. innocua is still lacking.
Various strain typing methods have been developed
and improved with a general shift from phenotype-based
to genotype-based strategies [14]. Given its accuracy,
reproducibility and increased speed of DNA sequencing,
DNA sequence-based multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) has gained more popularity [15], and provided
an overview of the population structure of L. monocytogenes [4,16]. Internalin profiling seems to be instrumental
to subtype L. monocytogenes strains into different serovars [17]. Moreover, internalin loci are also present in
non-pathogenic species, including L. innocua, and seem
to play broad roles not merely limited to attachment and
invasion of host cells [18-20].
In this study, we attempted to delineate a phylogenetic
framework based on internalin profiling and MLST analysis of a collection of L. innocua isolates from various
food sources, and further to investigate microevolution in
the L. innocua-L. monocytogenes clade.

Results
Biochemical patterns of L. innocua and L. monocytogenes
strains

All L. innocua and L. monocytogenes strains displayed
similar utilization patterns for xylose (negative), mannitol
(negative) and glucose (positive), while hemolysis could
distinguish these two species with L. monocytogenes
showing β-hemolysis and all L. innocua strains being
non-hemolytic. With regard to the rhamnose utilization
pattern, three L. innocua strains 386, L19 and L103 (3/34,
8.8%) as well as L. monocytogenes sublineages IIIB and
IIIC strains covering serovars 4a, 4b and 4c were atypically negative for rhamnose fermentation (Table 1).
Internalin profiling indicates five internalin types (ITs) of L.
innocua

Upon examination of 14 L. monocytogenes-L. innocua
common, 4 L. innocua-specific and 19 L. monocytogenesspecific internalin genes, L. innocua strains harbored 15
to 18 internalin genes, with three L. monocytogenes-L.
innocua common and one L. innocua-specific internalin
genes absent individually or in combination in certain L.
innocua strains (Table S1; Additional file 1). Eighteen L.
monocytogenes-specific internalin genes were absent in
all L. innocua strains except for L43 having inlJ (Table 1).
These L. innocua strains could be separated into five
internalin types (ITs), with IT1 containing a whole set of
L. monocytogenes-L. innocua common and L. innocuaspecific internalin genes, IT2 lacking lin1204, IT3 lacking
lin1204 and lin2539, IT4 lacking lin0661, lin0354 and
lin2539, and IT5 lacking lin1204 but bearing inlJ. The
majority of L. innocua strains fell into IT1 (17/34, 50%)
and IT2 (12/34, 35.4%). Among the remainders, three
belonged to IT3 (8.8%), one to IT4 (2.9%) and one to IT5
(2.9%). In addition, all L. monocytogenes strains contained
L. monocytogenes-L. innocua common internalin genes
ranging from 6 to 13, and lacked all L. innocua-specific
internalin genes (Table 2).
MLST correlates with internalin profiling of L. innocus
strains

Sixty-four strains in the L. monocytogenes-L. innocua
clade were classified into 61 unique sequence types (ST)
in the MLST scheme with a high discrimination index (DI
= 0.99, 0.76 to 0.98 per gene). The concatenated sequence
data showed that L. innocua was genetically monophyletic as compared to L. monocytogenes, with 34 L. innocua
and 30 L. monocytogenes strains bearing 391 (6.69%) and
820 (14.03%) polymorphisms respectively. The average
nucleotide diversity π of L. innocua was lower than that
of L. monocytogenes (1.06% vs 4.38%). However, the nonsynonymous/synonymous mutation rate of L. innocua
was higher than that of L. monocytogenes (0.0865 vs
0.0500) (Table 3).

With L. welshimeri as the outgroup species, the phylogenetic tree revealed nine major branches of the L. monocytogenes-L. innocua clade, four corresponding to the
recognized L. monocytogenes lineages I, II, IIIA/C and
IIIB, one harboring the low-virulent L. monocytogenes
lineage IIIA strains reported in our previous study [11],
and the other four beloning to L. innocua (Figure 1). The
majority of L. innocua strains were placed in two
branches: one contained 19 strains (55.9%) representing
STs 1, 4, 5, 7, 9-17, 21-23, 25 and 31, and the other harbored 13 strains (38.2%) representing STs 2, 3, 6, 8, 18-20,
24, 26 and 28-30. Remarkably, L. innocua strain L43
(ST27) showed the least genetic distance to the main
cluster of L. monocytogenes. This strain seems to serve as
the evolutionary intermediate between L. monocytogenes
and L. innocua main clusters together with the low-virulent L. monocytogenes lineage IIIA strain 54006. Additionally, L. innocua strain 0063 (ST6) was present on the
halfway between the L. innocua main cluster and strain
L43 (Figure 1).
Based on the MLST scheme and internalin profiling, L.
innocua could be divided into at least four subgroups.
Two main subgroups A and B located in the two major
branches of the phylogenetic tree, which correlated with
IT1 and IT3 (except strain 0063) (19/34, 55.9%), and IT2
and IT4 (13/34, 38.2%) respectively. In addition, one IT3
strain 0063 and one IT5 strain L43 present in two individual branches formed subgroups C and D respectively
(Table 2).
Phylogeny and population history of L. innocua

As aforementioned, L. innocua was genetically monophyletic (π = 1.06%) as compared to L. monocytogenes (π

= 4.38%). When sequence data were analyzed after stratification by subgroups, the number of polymorphisms and
genetic diversity within each subpopulations were
reduced (Table 3), suggesting a barrier for genetic
exchange between these L. innocua subgroups. Such barrier was also observed between L. monocytogenes lineages
(Table 3), consistent with one previous report [21].
Tajima's D test revealed that L. innocua and L. monocytogenes did not evolve under neutrality. A marginal positive value of Tajima's D observed for ribC in L.
monocytogenes (1.9963, 0.05 < p < 0.10) became smaller
or negative when analyses were performed for separate
lineages, suggesting a divided population structure. Similarly, significant or marginal positive Tajima's D values
were observed for gyrB (2.0401, p < 0.05) in L. monocytogenes lineage II, and for sigB (2.0426, p < 0.05) and gap
(1.7746, 0.05 < p < 0.10) in lineage III, supporting that lineages II and III represented diverse populations as compared to lineage I (Table 4). On the other hand, gyrB (2.2650, p < 0.01), betL (-2.5954, p < 0.001) and gap (2.4190, p < 0.01) showed significant negative Tajima's D
values in L. innocua, indicative of a bottleneck or selective sweep [22,23]. Also, Tajima's D were marginal negative for betL in L. innocua subgroup A (-1.7315, 0.05 < p <
0.10) and gap in subgroup B (-1.6523, 0.05 < p < 0.10)
(Table 4).
The exterior/interior branch length ratio test demonstrated that L. innocua and its subgroup A as well as L.
monocytogenes and its lineage I showed a significantly
smaller exterior/interior branch length ratio (p < 0.05)
than expected under the coalescent model (Figure 2).
This suggests that the contemporary L. innocua population experienced a recent expansion of its population

size, consistent with a population bottleneck. Specifically,
L. innocua subgroup A underwent expansion of the population size (p = 0.027), while subgroup II did not (p =
0.176) (Figure 2).
The rate of recombination within bacterical species can
differ widely from one species to another. In the L.
innocua-L. monocytogenes clade, both the relative frequency of occurrence of recombination versus mutation
(ρ/θ) and the relative effect of recombination versus point
mutation (r/m) were about two to three times higher in L.
innocua than in L. monocytogenes (Table 5). L. innocua
subgroup A exhibited significantly higher frequency (ρ/θ
= 3.7697) and effect (r/m = 12.0359) of recombination
than subgroup B (ρ/θ = 0.2818; r/m = 4.8132), consistent
with a definite population expansion of subgroup A as

aforementioned. However, the higher recombination rate
of L. innocua subgroup A did not seem to contribute to
nucleotide diversity (π for subgroups A and B are 0.46%
and 0.77% respectively) (Table 3 and Table 5). On the
other hand, both the frequency and effect of recombination in L. monocytogenes lineage II were higher than those
in lineages I and III (Table 5).
The phylogram based on the analysis with correction
for recombination revealed that the time to the most
recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of L. innocua subgroups A and B was similar (Figure 3), suggesting that
these two subgroups appeared at approximately the same
time. In addition, our study also showed the TMRCA of
L. monocytogenes lineages I and II were similar, consistent
with a recent report [24].

represents the low-virulent L. monocytogenes sublineages IIIA (seovar 4a) strain [11].

Distribution of L. innocua isolates among different sources

Of the 29 L. innocua food isolates, 13 were obtained from
meat, 8 from milk and 8 from seafoods. The majority of
meat isolates (10/13, 76.9%) belonged to subgroup A,
while most seafood isolates (5/8, 62.5%) belonged to subgroup B. There were significant associations between
subgroups and source of isolation (p < 0.05).

L. innocua isolates lack virulence genes found in L.
monocytogenes, and were nonpathogenic to mice

All L. innocua strains lacked 17 virulence genes examined, with the exception of the subgroup D strain (L43)
harboring inlJ (87.5%-93.6% nucleotide identities to L.
monocytogenes reference strains EGDe and F2365) and
two subgroup B strains (1603 and 386) bearing bsh
(97.7%-99.4% nucleotide identities to EGDe and F2365).

Discussion
The ecological, biochemical and genetical resemblance as
well as the clear differences of virulence between L.
monocytogenes and L. innocua make this bacterial clade

attractive as models to examine the evolution of pathogenicity in Listeria genus. L. monocytogenes causes lifethreatening infections in animals and human populations, and exhibits a diversity of strains with different
pathogenicity [25]. L. innocua has once been postulated
as the nonpathogenic variant of L. monocytogenes, and
holds the key to understanding the evolutionary history

of the L. monocytogenes-L. innocua clade. However, information on the phylogenetic structure and microevolution
of L. innocua is still lacking. Thus, we characterized L.
innocua strains in our laboratory stock from phylogentic
perspectives.
Profiling of 37 internalin genes grouped the L. innocua
strains into five internalin types, IT1 to IT5, with IT1 and
IT2 as the major types (Table 2). The MLST scheme identified two major phylogenetic branches containing the
majority of sequence types (29/31, 93.5%), and other two
bearing one strain each (Fig 1). Consequently, L. innocua
consists of at least four distinct subgroups A, B, C and D.
Subgroup A correlates with one of the major branches
including all the IT1 and IT3 strains with the exception of
one IT3 strain 0063 belonging to subgroup C, while subgroup B correlates with the other major branch covering
all the IT2 and IT4 strains (Table B2B). Therefore, it is
inferred that a certain L. innocua subgroup possibly contains several serovars and exhibits different internalin
patterns, which is similar to the fact that each lineage of
L. monocytogenes contains several serovars and exhibits
more than one internalin patterns, as exemplified by the
internalin island between ascB and dapE in our previous
report [17].
The majority of L. monocytogenes lineage I strains harbor inlC2DE, and a small number of 1/2b strains carry
inlGC2DE instead. Within L. monocytogenes lineage II

strains, the majority of 1/2a and 1/2c strains harbor
inlGC2DE and inlGHE respectively. In addition, L. monocytogenes lineage III strains show the greatest level of
diversity [8,17]. The L. innocua subgroup A strains either
contain a whole set of L. monocytogenes-L. innocua common and L. innocua-specific internalin genes, or lack
lin1204 and lin2539, and the L. innocua subgroup B
strains either lack lin1204 or lack lin0661, lin0354 and
lin2539 instead. Besides, the subgroup D strain L43,
which shows the least genetic distance to L. monocytogenes, lacks lin1204 but bears L. monocytogenes-specific
inlJ in the counterpart region in L. monocytogenes
genomes (Table 2). We propose that certain internalin
genes such as lin0354, lin0661, lin1204 and lin2539 could
be potential genetic markers for subgroups of L. innocua.
The phylogenetic tree revealed nine major branches of
the L. innocua-L. monocytogenes clade, five belonged to
L. monocytogenes representing lineages I, II, and III, consistent with previous reports [11,24,26], and the other
four represented L. innocua subgroups A, B, C and D (Fig
1). Overall, L. innocua is genetically monophyletic compared to L. monocytogenes, and the nucleotide diversity of
the L. innocua species is similar to that of L. monocytogenes lineage I but less than those of L. monocytogenes lineages II and III. In evolutionary terms, younger bacterial
species has lower level of genetic diversity [15]. The
results from this study offer additional evidence that L.

innocua possibly represents a relatively young species as
compared to its closest related pathogenic species L.
monocytogenes.
Previous studies suggest that L. monocytogenes represents one of the bacterial species with the lowest rate of
recombination [4,27]. In this study, strains in the L.
innocua-L. monocytogenes clade exhibit similar value of
ρ/θ to those of the Bacillus anthracis-Bacillus cereus
clade [28] and slightly higher than those of Staphylococcus aureus [29], but still considerably lower than those of

pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens [30], Neisseria
meningitis [31] and Streptococcus pneumoniae [29]. Both
the relative frequency of occurrence of recombination
versus mutation (ρ/θ) and the relative effect of recombination versus point mutation (r/m) of L. innocua were
higher than those of L. monocytogenes. More strikingly,
recombination rates of L. innocua subgroup A were particularly high (Table 5). Wirth et al. [32] proposed from
the data for Escherichia coli that epidemic and virulent
bacteria face an increased selective pressure for rapid

Chen et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:97
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/97

diversification in response to host immune defenses,
resulting in higher recombination rates. L. monocytogenes
is an opportunistic pathogen with wide host ranges as
well as a saprotroph found in different environments
[2,33]. Though lineage I strains were responsible for
almost all major human listeriosis outbreaks and the
majority of sporadic cases [6], those of lineage II exhibited higher recombination rate according to our observation and the findings by Bakker et al. [24]. Bakker et al.
[24] proposed that higher recombination in lineage II was
not due to selective forces involved in its virulence.
Recombination may be critical for lineage II to successfully compete and survive in a board range of different
environments. Lineage II strains are more commonly
found at higher levels than lineage I strains in natural
environments including foods [24,34]. Similarly, we postulate that the nonpathogenic species L. innocua
descending from its pathogenic ancestor has better
adaptability to contemporary environmental niches.
Removal of some gene loci related to virulence (e.g., LIPI1, inlAB and bsh) in Listeria could be regarded as adaptive
gene loss, which favors its survival in environmental
niches as a saprotroph [9,11].
L. innocua subgroups A and B strains have similar
TMRCA and exhibit similar genetic distances to L. monocytogenes, suggesting that these two subgroups appeared
at approximately the same time (Fig 2). However, subgroup A experienced a recent expansion of the population size, consistent with the higher recombination
frequency (r/m) and effect (ρ/θ) of subgroup A as compared to those of subgroup B. This further implies that
these two subgroups have distinct inclinations and adaptive abilities to environments and occupy different habitats, while subgroup A might face increased selective
pressures resulting in higher recombination rates. Additional support for this indication is that the majority of
subgroup A isolates (belonging IT1) contain a whole set
of L. monocytogenes-L. innocua common and L. innocuaspecific internalin genes which may play broad roles in
enhancing the adaption to various environments. Hence,
the L. innocua subgroup A strains might represent the
possible evolutionary direction towards adaptation.
Interestingly, the higher recombination rate of L. innocua
subgroup A did not seem to contribute to nucleotide
diversity. One possible explanation is that members of
subgroup A recombines only with other members of subgroup A, so that recombination does not introduce novel
polymorphisms into subgroup A and therefore does not
increase the genetic diversity.
Previous reports indicate that horizontal gene transfer
might have occurred earlier to form a more ancestral L.
monocytogenes strain, which would then give rise to L.
innocua through gene deletion events possibly via lowvirulent L. monocytogenes lineage IIIA strains [11,13]. In
this study, L. innocua subgroup D strain L43 exhibits the

Page 12 of 16

least genetic distances to L. monocytogenes (Fig 1), and
constituted another evolutionary intermediates between
L. monocytogenes and L. innocua main clusters. Therefore, L. innocua strain L43 and L monocytogenes strain
54006 [11] might serve as intermediate linkage strains in
deciphering the evolution of the L. innocua-L. monocytogenes clade.
The strain L43 seems to share a "hybrid" genetic background derived from L. innocua and L. monocytogenes by
the MLST data and its carriage of L. monocytogenes-specific virulence gene inlJ. InlJ is a sortase-anchored
adhesin specifically expressed in vivo [35], but its function in atypical L. innocua strains requires further investigation. Another atypical L. innocua strain PRL/NW
15B95 has been characterized as having the entire LIPI-1
embedded into an otherwise typical L. innocua genetic
background [9]. However, we did not see its presence in
the strain L43. PRL/NW 15B95 falls into the main L.
innocua cluster based on sequencing of 16S-23S intergenic regions, 16S rRNA and iap genes, and has possibly
acquired LIPI-1 by a later transposition event, based on
the finding of a 16 bp Tn1545 integration consensus
sequence flanking the virulence island [9]. Thus, unlike
L43, PRL/NW 15B95 does not constitute an evolutional
intermediate between L. monocytogenes and L. innocua.
Complementary transfer of only some of the virulence
genes such as LIPI-1 did not change the avirulent character of PRL/NW 15B95 [9]. In this study, all L. innocua
strains were nonpathogenic in mice models (Table 1).

Conclusion
This study reveals that L. innocua is a relatively young
species descending from L. monocytogenes. The evolutionary history in the L. monocytogenes-L. innocua clade
represents a rare example of evolution towards reduced
virulence of pathogens. L. innocua is genetically monophyletic and comprises four subgroups based on internalin profiling and MLST scheme. The majority of L.
innocua strains belong to two major subgroups A and B,
and one atypical subgroup might serve as a link between
L. monocytogenes and L. innocua main cluster in the evolutionary chain. While subgroups A and B appeared at
approximately the same time, the subgroup A strains
seem to represent the possible evolutionary direction
towards adaptation to enviroments. It is believed that the
phylogenetic structure and evolutionary history of L.
innocua will be much clearer if a larger strain collection
and the whole genome sequences of more representative
strains become available.
Methods
Bacterial strains

A total of 68 Listeria strains were examined in this study
(Table 1). These included 30 L. monocytogenes strains
representing three lineages, 34 L. innocua strains, 5 from

Chen et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:97
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/97

reference collections, 13 from meat, 8 from milk and 8
from seafoods, and 4 L. welshimeri strains. Listeria
strains were retrieved from glycerol stocks maintained at
-80°C, and cultured in brain heart infusion broth (BHI;
Oxoid, Hampshire, England) at 37°C.
Carbohydrate fermentation and hemolytic reactions

The recommended biochemical patterns for differentiating Listeria spp. included L-rhamnose, D-xylose, D-mannitol and glucose utilization and hemolytic reactivity, and
were tested by using conventional procedures [36,37].
DNA manipulations

Genomic DNA was extracted using a protocol reported
previously [12]. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen Biotechnology (Shanghai, China)
(Table 6 and Additional file 1; table S2), and Taq DNA
polymerase (TaKaRa Biotech Co. Ltd., Dalian, China) was
used for PCR amplification. PCR was conducted using a
PT-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc. MA, Boston,
USA), with annealing temperatures depending on specific primer pairs (Table 6 and Additional file 1; table S2),
and the duration of extension depending on the expected
length of amplicon (1 min per kb, at 72°C). For DNA
sequencing analysis, PCR fragments were purified with
the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Inc., USA)
and their sequences determined by dideoxy method on
ABI-PRISM 377 DNA sequencer.
Internalin profiling

By sequence comparison of L. monocytogenes strains
F2365, H7858 (serovar 4b), EGDe and F6854 (serovar 1/
2a) and L. innocua strain CLIP11262, we investigated the
presence or absence of 14 L. monocytogenes-L. innocuacommon and 4 L. innocua-specific internalin genes as
well as 19 L. monocytogenes-specific internalin genes by
PCR with specific primers outlined in Additional file 1;
table S1. Due to the conserved repeats present in internalin multigene family [19], primers were designed based
on the distinguishable regions through sequence comparison. As inlH and inlC2 shared highly identical nucleotide
sequences, a common primer set was employed [17].
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)

The MLST scheme was based on the sequence analysis of
9 unlinked genes, including 7 housekeeping genes gyrB,
dapE, hisJ, ribC, purM, gap and tuf, and 2 stress-response
genes sigB and betL. Sequences generated in this study
have been deposited in GenBank within the accession
numbers FJ774089 to FJ774121 (gyrB), FJ774145 to
FJ774177 (sigB), FJ774274 to FJ774282, FJ774257 to
FJ774273, FJ774283 to FJ774293, FJ774295 to FJ774297,
FJ774299 to FJ4300 (gap), FJ774313 to FJ774344,
FJ774368 (hisJ), FJ774369 to FJ774400, FJ774424 (purM),

(dapE), FJ774537 to FJ774568 (tuf), and FJ774593 to
FJ774625 (betL).
Detection of virulence genes

Five categories of virulence genes found in L. monocytogenes were assessed by using primers listed in Additional
file 1; table S2, including (i) stress response genes conferring tolerance to harsh conditions within the host (e.g.
bsh, arcB, arcD, lmo0038 and arcC); (ii) internalin genes
responsible for adhesion and invasion of host cells (e.g.
inlA, inlB, inlC, inlF and inlJ); (iii) genes involved in
escape from vacuole and intracellular multiplication (e.g.
plcA, hly, mpl, plcB and hpt); (iv) the gene associated with
intracellular and intercellular spread (e.g. actA); and (v)
regulatory genes (e.g. prfA).
Mouse infection

The virulence potential of 33 L. innocua strains and 30 L.
monocytogenes isolates was assessed in ICR mice by a
previously reported protocol [38]. The animal experiment was approved by the Laboratory Animal Management Committee of Zhejiang University, and the mice
were handled under strict ethical conditions. Briefly, 5
female ICR mice at 20-22 g (Zhejiang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou, China) were inoculated intraperitoneally with ~108 CFU each strain in a 0.1
ml-volume. Mice in the control group were injected with
0.1 ml PBS. The mice were observed daily and mortalities
recorded until all of the mice inoculated with the virulent
EGDe strain died. Relative virulence (%) was calculated
by dividing the number of dead mice with the total number of mice tested. On the 15th day post- inoculation, all
surviving mice were euthanized.
Data analysis

For each MLST locus, an allele number was given to each
distinct sequence variant, and a distinct sequence type
(ST) number was given to each distinct combination of
alleles of the 9 genes. MEGA 4.0 was used to construct a
neighbor-joining tree of L. innocua and L. monocytogenes
isolates using the number of nucleotide differences in the
concatenated sequences of 9 loci with 1,000 bootstrap
tests [39]. L. welshimeri was used as outgroup species.
DNAsp v4.10.9 [40] was used to calculate the number of
alleles, number of polymorphic sites, nucleotide diversity
(π, mean pairwise nucleotide difference per site), Tajima's
D (for testing the hypothesis that all mutations are selectively neutral [41]), numbers of synonymous mutations
and nonsynonymous mutations and the rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes with a Jukes-Cantor
correction. Discrimination index (D.I.) values of selected
genes were calculated according to the method previously
described [42] on the basis of allelic types [j], numbers of
strains belonging to each type [nj], and the total numbers

ClonalFrame v1.1 was employed to show the evolution
of ρ/θ and r/m as chain run. These two complementary
measures were used to assess the relative contribution of
recombination and mutation in the creation of the sample population from a common ancestor. Specifically, ρ/θ
is the ratio of rates at which recombination and mutation
occur, representing a measure of how often recombination happen relative to mutation [43], while r/m is the
ratio of probabilities that a given site is altered through
recombination and mutation, representing a measure of
how important the effect of recombination is in the diversification of the sample population relative to mutation
[44].
To infer the population history in the L. innocua-L.
monocytogenes clade, ClonalFrame GUI, which treated

each gene as an independent unit in the input file, was
used to calculate the ratio of the sum of the external
branches (the ones that connect a leaf of the tree) to the
sum of the internal branches (the ones that connect two
internal nodes of the tree) [45]. The distribution of these
ratios was then compared to the distribution of the external/internal branch length ratio as expected under the
coalescent model [46]. If the external/internal branch
length ratio is significantly smaller than expected, it
means that the inferred genealogy is unexpectedly "starlike", which is consistent with an expansion of the population size.
The chi-squared test was used to test significant associations between L. innocua subgroup and isolate source.
