Abstract
Background: It is a matter of ongoing debate whether a universal species concept is possible for
bacteria. Indeed, it is not clear whether closely related isolates of bacteria typically form discrete
genotypic clusters that can be assigned as species. The most challenging test of whether species can
be clearly delineated is provided by analysis of large populations of closely-related, highly
recombinogenic, bacteria that colonise the same body site. We have used concatenated sequences
of seven house-keeping loci from 770 strains of 11 named Neisseria species, and phylogenetic trees,
to investigate whether genotypic clusters can be resolved among these recombinogenic bacteria
and, if so, the extent to which they correspond to named species.
Results: Alleles at individual loci were widely distributed among the named species but this
distorting effect of recombination was largely buffered by using concatenated sequences, which
resolved clusters corresponding to the three species most numerous in the sample, N. meningitidis,
N. lactamica and N. gonorrhoeae. A few isolates arose from the branch that separated N. meningitidis
from N. lactamica leading us to describe these species as 'fuzzy'.
Conclusion: A multilocus approach using large samples of closely related isolates delineates
species even in the highly recombinogenic human Neisseria where individual loci are inadequate for
the task. This approach should be applied by taxonomists to large samples of other groups of
closely-related bacteria, and especially to those where species delineation has historically been
difficult, to determine whether genotypic clusters can be delineated, and to guide the definition of
species.

Background
The definition of bacterial species, and a concept of species applicable to all bacteria, are problems that have long
exercised systematists and microbiologists [1-4]. While
species names have been assigned to groups of organisms
sharing many common phenotypic traits, and a certain
minimum level of genomic similarity, attempts to define
species using DNA sequences have been relatively unsuccessful. The existence of very different levels of sequence
diversity among named species, and the variable extent of

gene flow within and between bacterial taxa [5], complicates species concepts and definitions. Indeed, for many,
bacterial species are constructs of the human mind, arising from our desire to impose order on the bacterial kingdom [6,7], rather than natural subdivisions imposed by
underlying genetic processes, and a central question is not
so much how species should best be assigned, but
whether such entities exist and can be delineated.

Molecular approaches to assigning bacteria to species
began with the introduction of DNA-DNA hybridization,
which allowed an objective assessment of the extent of
sequence similarity among a set of genomes, and remains
the systematicist's gold standard, defining bacterial species as those isolates whose genomes show at least 70%
hybridization under standardized conditions [3]. However, few laboratories now use this method and, in practice, novel isolates (and particularly those that presently
are unculturable) are usually compared to each other, and
to known taxa, by assessing the sequence similarities in
their 16S rRNA genes. 16S rRNA sequences are highly conserved and do not provide sufficient resolution to explore
the relatedness among closely related bacterial populations and less conserved genes need to be used to delineate similar species.
Individual isolates of a named species differ in gene content [8] and the distribution of these genes is key to understanding the variable properties of isolates of a species,
particularly among bacterial pathogens. These auxiliary
loci exist alongside the set of genes that are present in all
isolates of the named species (the core genome) and
which include those that encode enzymes with housekeeping functions [9]. Besides being present in all isolates
of a species, the genetic variation in core house-keeping
genes is considered to be largely neutral, and thus provides a more reliable indication of genetic relatedness
than variation in genes that are subject to strong selection
[10]. We would expect any reasonable definition of a species to delineate a cluster of isolates that have very closelyrelated house-keeping loci that are present in all isolates
of a species (as has also been proposed for eukaryotes
[11]). However, single house-keeping loci are unlikely to
have sufficient variation to allow confident resolution of
the different lineages. For recombinogenic bacteria, and
arguably all bacteria, multi-locus approaches are required,
as these provide increased resolution, and also reduce the
impact of 'inter-species' recombination. Thus, a localized
interspecies recombinational event at one locus, which
distorts the true relatedness between species, is buffered
by the more reliable indications of relatedness provided
by the other loci. Furthermore, attempts to observe
whether or not species exist, and how sharply they can be
defined, requires the analysis of large populations of each
candidate species and not just one or a few reference
isolates.
A multilocus approach has recently been applied to small
numbers of isolates of several relatively distantly related
named species of enterobacteria [10], and other bacteria
[11], and to larger numbers of isolates of related bacteria
that are believed to have relatively low rates of recombination [12-14]. However, it is unclear whether species can be
resolved using a multilocus approach in the more chal-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/6

lenging case of highly recombinogenic bacteria colonising
the same body site. Ideally, we would like to know if, in a
large collection of such isolates that are believed to
include examples of a number of closely related named
species, we can resolve well delineated clusters, and the
extent to which any clusters relate to the species names
assigned by standard microbiological procedures. Can
such populations diverge into distinct populations, and
stay distinct, in the face of frequent and promiscuous
recombination?
In this study we have evaluated the ability of seven individual house-keeping gene sequences, and of the concatenated sequences of these genes, to resolve a large sample
of human pathogenic and commensal Neisseria into genotypic clusters. We chose this example because Neisseria
are naturally transformable, are among the most recombinogenic bacteria, and there is good evidence for relatively
frequent localised recombination between the named
Neisseria species [15,16] through transformation. We
demonstrate that individual genes are incapable of identifying consistent clusters among the Neisseria isolates, but
the tree based on the concatenated sequences effectively
resolves the three major named species within the sample,
although the boundaries are fuzzy due to the presence of
a small number of intermediate genotypes.

Results
The widespread use of multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
[17] for epidemiological purposes provides the sequences
of seven house-keeping gene fragments from thousands of
isolates of several bacterial pathogens. However, few of
the available MLST databases include any substantial
numbers of isolates of multiple closely related named species. An exception is the public Neisseria MLST database,
which includes several thousand sequence types (STs) of
N. meningitidis and smaller numbers assigned to several
other named human Neisseria species [18] on the basis of
standard phenotypic tests. The first 500 STs of N. meningitidis were compared with all STs assigned to the other
human Neisseria species. The sequences of the seven gene
fragments were concatenated in-frame and a tree was constructed (using third codon position sites) using Mr Bayes
[19]. Figure 1 is the majority rule consensus of 10 000
trees generated from the posterior probability at stationarity. All 67 STs of N. gonorrhoeae, and all but two of the 171
STs of N. lactamica, descend from single well-supported
nodes (the remaining two N. lactamica clustered very
anomalously and have probably been incorrectly identified). The great majority of N. meningitidis also formed a
single well-resolved cluster, but a few arise from the
branch leading to the N. lactamica isolates. Very similar
clustering of these three species was observed using other
sets of 500 N. meningitidis STs from the database, and in a
neighbour-joining tree constructed using all STs in the

Figureconstructed from concatenated MLST data resolves species clusters in Neisseria
A tree 1
A tree constructed from concatenated MLST data resolves species clusters in Neisseria. The 50% majority rule
consensus tree shown was produced in Mr Bayes using third position sites within the concatenated sequences of Neisserial species as described in methods. Assigned species names are indicated by the symbols. Two subtrees, A and B, are shown. These
both contain strains identified as N. mucosa, N. sicca and N. subflava, showing that these named species do not form single clusters by this method. In these subtrees, the clades containing exclusively N. lactamica or N. gonorrhoeae have been collapsed.

Neisseria MLST database (data not shown). The high levels
of recombination in the Neisseria make the fine structure
of the tree meaningless (Figure 1), and here we use the
tree-building software first and foremost as a clustering
tool.
Analysis of the individual gene trees shows that these fail
to resolve the named species and highlights many examples where interspecies recombination has resulted in
anomalous clustering (Figure 2). The clear inability of single locus trees to resolve the named species, which are well
resolved using the concatenated sequences, establishes
that multiple loci are required to buffer against the distorting effect of inter-species recombination at the individual
loci. Although the concatenated sequences resolve three
named species, N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and N.
lactamica, their boundaries are not perfectly defined and a
number of isolates are placed on the branch between N.
lactamica and N. meningitidis, representing intermediate
genotypes.
The small numbers of STs assigned to other human Neisseria species do not cluster clearly. A significant separation
is observed between two subtrees (A and B in Figure 1),
although these both contain isolates assigned as N. sicca,
N. mucosa and N. subflava. Multiple minimum-evolution
trees constructed using all STs of these other Neisseria species and randomly selected samples of ten STs from each
of N. meningitidis, N. lactamica and N. gonorrhoeae,
showed the same deep split between these subtrees, which
was also observed in trees constructed from all Neisseria
STs (all species) in the MLST database, using NeighbourJoining, minimum evolution and UPGMA tree-building
approaches (data not shown).

Discussion
Current molecular definitions of species use rules or cutoff values (e.g. ≥ 70% DNA-DNA hybridization) and
rarely take account of the genotypic diversity within and
between populations [3]. A more natural and pragmatic
approach is to analyse large populations of related isolates, that are believed to cover multiple species, and to
observe whether suitable molecular methods can resolve
distinct clusters in sequence space that can be given appropriate names [11]. This approach has not yet been rigorously applied to bacteria. Consequently we have no idea
whether large populations of related bacteria can invariably be divided into discrete clusters using suitable molecular methods or, alternatively, whether many groups of
related bacteria fall into a genetic continuum where clear
divisions do not exist.
Sequence-based approaches should help us answer this
question. However, most studies have focused on single
loci and small numbers of isolates, whereas multilocus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/6

approaches with large populations are essential as the history of individual genes (including rRNA operons [20])
may be obscured by interspecies recombination, and clusters observed using a small number of isolates may merge
when larger numbers of isolates are considered. Comparison of the tree based on the concatenated sequences with
the individual gene trees clearly illustrates the inadequacy
of single loci for resolving N. meningitidis and N. lactamica
(Figure 2). The concatenation of the seven housekeeping
loci shows that multiple loci can buffer against the distorting effects of inter-species recombination and that the
boundaries between the three dominant species in the
Neisseria MLST database can be resolved.
Network based methods (e.g. Neighbor-Net [21], Splitstree [22]) applied to both the concatenates and individual loci produce output with numerous reticulations,
indicating the conflicting signals in the data, such that the
implied relationships between STs within clusters have no
phylogenetic meaning. Nevertheless, the use of multiple
loci enables us to observe the species clusters even in the
presence of conflicting signals. The three main clusters
coincide well with the species names derived by standard
microbiological procedures and the present definitions of
N. meningitidis, N. lactamica and N. gonorrhoeae are reasonably secure; the two N. lactamica that clustered highly
anomalously probably represent species mis-identification. The most critical test of the multilocus approach is
the ability to resolve N. lactamica from N. meningitidis
since these colonise the same body site, the nasopharynx.
Resolution of these named species was remarkably good,
although the boundaries between N. lactamica and N.
meningitidis are somewhat fuzzy, due to the existence of
intermediate forms. This is to be expected as recombinogenic bacteria have mosaic genomes, resulting from the
occasional replacement of chromosomal segments with
those from related populations. Thus, in any large dataset,
there may be isolates in which one or more of the loci
used in a multilocus approach to species definition will
have been recently introduced from a related population.
Single unusually divergent replacements, or replacements
at more than one of the multiple loci, may place isolates
away from the majority of isolates of the species. However, only seven STs in Figure 1 fell into this category (of
667 STs from isolates identified as either N. meningitidis or
N. lactamica), and there was no overlap between these two
named species (i.e. a region containing isolates identified
as both species interspersed with one another).
Sorting the human commensal Neisseria into species has
been difficult, with frequent revisions of species names
[23]. We gain some insight into the extent and source of
this difficulty in Figure 1, where isolates assigned as N.
mucosa, N. sicca and N. subflava each fall in very different
parts of the tree, and the subtree shown in Figure 1A

contains several closely related isolates that have been
assigned to these three different named species. Additional studies of the human commensal, Neisseria (and of
other groups plagued with similar problems, such as viridans streptococci) using the multilocus approach with
large datasets, should clarify whether they fall into distinct
clusters, or whether the difficulties in defining species by
phenotypic methods reflect an underlying genetic reality
in which resolved clusters are not evident.
If necessary, further resolution between apparent clusters
may be attempted by increasing the numbers of loci
sequenced. Provided that the alleles at these loci show a
degree of specificity to a given species cluster, then the
resolution of that cluster will be enhanced. If this cannot
be demonstrated, then it is likely that the isolates under
test do not genuinely form separate populations, and
should not be considered to be distinct species. This
approach lends itself to "electronic taxonomy", in which
systematic classification may be evermore finely elucidated through the accumulation of online sequence
databases.
The work described here obviously begs the question of
what forces or mechanisms could generate such separation among recombining bacteria. We offer a simple
model for recombining organisms as follows: consider
two populations freely recombining within themselves
and with each other. New mutations arising in one population will readily spread to the other, and to an observer
they appear to form one cluster of related strains. If a barrier to recombination should be erected between them,
such that isolates are much more likely to undergo recombination with their own population, then the rate of generation of new genotypes within each population may
increase beyond the rate at which such genetic innovation
is shared and the two populations begin to diverge. As the
populations diverge, decreasing sequence identity will
further impede recombination, thus reinforcing the effect
of the original genetic barrier and creating a permanent
separation [24,25].
It is not difficult to suggest candidate mechanisms. Niche
separation is one example, and almost certainly underlies
the tight well-defined cluster of N. gonorrhoeae. Unlike the
other human Neisseria, which colonise the nasopharynx,
the primary niche of the gonococcus is the genital tract,
and it has been proposed that gonococci arose relatively
recently due to the successful invasion of the genital tract
by a nasopharyngeal Neisseria lineage [26]. Similarly,
what appears to be single body site (e.g. the human
nasopharynx) may contain multiple niches that can be
exploited, leading to opportunities for speciation. Restriction-modification systems [27], limitation of transforma-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/6

bility by differences in pheromone-type [28] and similar
processes are feasible alternatives.
The point at which such a group is described as a species
is a matter more of human interest and attention than any
intrinsic evolutionary process. The properties of the species clusters we observe will be determined by the diversification of those strains sharing the speciation loci (i.e
those that determine gene flow). Because speciation is
gradual, we should be able using estimates of recombination within and between groups derived from multilocus
data, to define nascent species which if they continue to
diversify in isolation, are expected to form distinct
sequence clusters, ie species, in the future.

Conclusion
The bacterial domain of life is not uniform. Instead we see
clumps of similar strains that share many characteristics,
and with an innate human urge to classify, we have
defined these as species. This work shows that by applying
a simple approach using sequence data from multiple
core housekeeping loci, we can resolve those clusters, provided such clusters exist. However, these species clusters
are not ideal entities with sharp and unambiguous
boundaries; instead they come in multiple forms and
their fringes, especially in recombinogenic bacteria, may
be fuzzy and indistinct. A multilocus approach using large
numbers of isolates will provide data that help us to
develop theoretical models of how species emerge, and
relate these to the observed population genetic structure
of bacteria. This should be enormously helpful to taxonomists, whose foremost duty will remain to provide us with
pragmatic species designations which attempt to reflect
the underlying genetic reality.

Methods
Strains
The contents of the publicly accessible Neisseria MLST
database [17,18] were used to explore the validity of the
approach described here for other species. Alleles at the
seven MLST loci of all isolates defined as Neisserial species
other than N. meningitidis (67 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae,
171 of N. lactamica, 5 of N. sicca, 3 of N. mucosa, 5 of N.
cinerea, 7 of N. polysacchareae, 3 of N. flava, 4 of N. perflava,
4 of N. subflava and 1 isolate of N. flavescens) were concatenated as described below, and analysed together with
the concatenated sequences of N. meningitidis strains with
ST numbers from 1 to 500. Species definitions were as
recorded at [17,18], and were according to standard clinical microbiological schema. The sequences of the individual alleles at the seven loci in the above Neisseria were also
used to construct individual gene trees.

Phylogenetics and population genetics
MLST loci were concatenated in-frame to form a 3267 bp
sequence, of which only third position sites were used in
subsequent analyses. To illustrate clustering in this dataset, a tree was constructed using Mr Bayes 3.0b4 [19]. A
starting tree was determined in PAUP (version 4 beta 10)
[29] using the Neighbour-Joining method with distances
corrected using the HKY85 model. The starting tree was
input into Mr Bayes, and four Markov Chain Monte Carlo
chains were run with default heating parameters until
convergence and 10 000 trees were sampled from the posterior probability distribution. These were then used to
produce a 50% majority rule consensus tree. Minimum
evolution trees for individual loci were constructed in
MEGA 2.1 [30]. Third position sites were used with the
Kimura 2-parameter distance correction.
