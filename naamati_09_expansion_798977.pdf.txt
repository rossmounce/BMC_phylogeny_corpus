Abstract
Background: The complete proteome of the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, provides
insights into gene invention dating back to the Cnidarian-Bilaterian ancestor. With the addition of
the complete proteomes of Hydra magnipapillata and Monosiga brevicollis, the investigation of
proteins having unique features in early metazoan life has become practical. We focused on the
properties and the evolutionary trends of tandem repeat (TR) sequences in Cnidaria proteomes.
Results: We found that 11-16% of N. vectensis proteins contain tandem repeats. Most TRs cover
150 amino acid segments that are comprised of basic units of 5-20 amino acids. In total, the N.
Vectensis proteome has about 3300 unique TR-units, but only a small fraction of them are shared
with H. magnipapillata, M. brevicollis, or mammalian proteomes. The overall abundance of these TRs
stands out relative to that of 14 proteomes representing the diversity among eukaryotes and within
the metazoan world. TR-units are characterized by a unique composition of amino acids, with
cysteine and histidine being over-represented. Structurally, most TR-segments are associated with
coiled and disordered regions. Interestingly, 80% of the TR-segments can be read in more than one
open reading frame. For over 100 of them, translation of the alternative frames would result in long
proteins. Most domain families that are characterized as repeats in eukaryotes are found in the TRproteomes from Nematostella and Hydra.
Conclusions: While most TR-proteins have originated from prediction tools and are still awaiting
experimental validations, supportive evidence exists for hundreds of TR-units in Nematostella. The
existence of TR-proteins in early metazoan life may have served as a robust mode for novel genes
with previously overlooked structural and functional characteristics.

Background
Repeated domains in proteins are associated with a broad
spectrum of functions. They have originated from repetitive DNA elements, including transposons, retroviruses,
and other parasitic elements that impact genome dynamics. While most of these events are deleterious, some may

lead to new proteins or protein domains, as was shown
for Alu repeats in primates [1]. Repeated sequences may
account for the majority of the genetic material in many
eukaryotic genomes, among them the human genome [2].
Some repeated sequences may result in open reading
frames (ORFs) of substantial length. If these sequences are

integrated into an actively transcribed region, subsequent
events such as recombination and gene conversion can
spread this repeated sequence, resulting in fast amplification of the original ORF [3].
Tandem repeats (TR) in proteins are of various types. At
one extreme are those based on a single amino acid
repeat. Slippage during DNA replication could yield a
repeated unit of exactly 3 nucleotides, resulting in the gain
of a single amino acid. It has also been found that most
mono-amino acid repeats in primates are encoded by GCrich isochores [4], but there exists a strong purifying selection against such short repeats at the DNA level [5]. The
over-represented mono-amino acid repeats in eukaryotes
are glutamine (Q), proline (P), glutamic acid (E), asparagine (N), aspartic acid (D), and serine (S). Mono-amino
acid repeats appear mostly in transcription factors and
protein kinases [6,7], where they occupy flexible regions
and loops. Interestingly, the number of repeated
glutamines (Q) in key proteins correlates with the severity
of Huntington disease and Fragile X Syndrome [8].
A TR protein may contain short repeat units (3-4 amino
acids), which occur tens and hundreds of times in tandem. In such cases, the TR units typically form an
extended structure, with this phenomenon quite common
in structural proteins such as collagens, keratins, antifreeze proteins, and spider silks. Such structural proteins
and others, like the FG-rich proteins of the nuclear pore
[9], possess unique biophysical and thermodynamic
properties.
About 250 InterPro entries [10] are characterized as
'repeats'. These are protein regions that do not fold into a
globular domain on their own [11]. Often, several of these
repeats are needed to form a globular domain. Known
examples for repeated domains that provide the scaffold
of the protein are ankyrin (33 amino acids), keltch (50
amino acids), TRP (34 amino acids) and armadillo (40
amino acids) repeats. The stable 3D structures of these
domain families rely on the rearrangement of their
repeated units; for example, the repeat unit of WD40 represents a four-stranded β-sheet arrangement. In fact, many
of the repeated domains are rich in β-sheets, where these
proteins typically participate in a network of interactions
such as in cell-cell contact, pathogen adhesion [12], and
cell signaling.
Several methods and tools for detecting repeats in large
protein databases are available [13-16]. TRs that are characterized by a predefined periodicity are categorized in the
TRIPS database [14]. Tools such as HHRep [17] and PEPPER [18] efficiently address genome-scale search for multiple repeats in proteins. The latter is suitable for analyzing
sequences of fibrous proteins. TRPpred is a tool that was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/593

optimized for identifying repeated units in several protein
families including TRP [19]. The Xstream server [20] is a
sensitive tool for detecting TRs on a large-scale. Furthermore, it permits flexibility in defining TRs, by fine-tuning
the parameters to successfully detect TRs in DNA or protein sequences. The Xstream server does not tolerate nonconserved spacers between the TR units. Therefore, proteins having multiple repeated domains (e.g., WD40,
Kelch) do not necessarily fulfill the Xstream definition of
TR-proteins.
Currently, most multicellular model organisms that have
been studied come from Bilateria. An important step
toward the study of metazoan evolution comes from the
eumetazoan phylum Cnidaria, a lineage that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids. A genomic perspective on the metazoan origin comes from the recently
sequenced genomes of the choanoflagellate Monosiga
brevicollis [21], the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, and Hydra magnipapillata [22]. The addition of
genomic information from several Porifera (sponges)
contributed to the reconstruction of the evolutionary
position of Metazoa with respect to Fungi [23]. Surprisingly, many genes that were initially regarded as vertebrate-specific have in fact been identified in the N.
vectensis genome [22]. These genomes allowed researchers
to estimate the branch linking Cnidaria and the Bilateria
to have occurred 650-750 million years ago [24].
Herein, we focus on the prevalence of TRs in the sea anemone proteome. When comparing it to other genomes, a
surprising enrichment in the size and complexity of its TRs
is evident. The diversity of the TR sequences from N. vectensis is considerably higher than that identified in any
other multicellular eukaryotic genome. The properties of
the TRs in N. vectensis are discussed in view of their evolutionary potential as a source for gene novelty. We discuss
the advantages of expansion and increased diversity of TRproteins as a robust mode for constructing new genes with
unique functional properties.

Results
Scarlet sea anemone proteome is exceptionally rich in
tandem repeats
An increased number of sequenced genomes led to a
revised view of the origin of metazoan life. The eumetazoan clade contains taxa with nervous systems and muscle
cells: Cnidaria, Ctenophora, and Bilateria [25]. In addition, the complete proteome of the starlet sea anemone,
Nematostella vectensis, provides insight into gene invention
dating hundreds of millions of years ago back to the last
common Cnidarian-Bilaterian ancestor [26]. The N. vectensis genome allows us to examine the evolution of an
ancestral genome that is rich in TRs. Examples of TR-proteins that fulfill this definition are shown in Figure 1A.

Figure 1
TR-containing proteins from N. vectensis
TR-containing proteins from N. vectensis. Graphical representation of two TR-containing proteins: A7SW76 and A7S5V7
(UniProt). Proteins contain TR with a unit length of 49 amino acids (yellow, TR-unit). This TR-unit appears twice on A7SW76,
while the other two TR-units are unique to A7SW76. These TR-units are of length 7 and 21 amino acids (blue and green),
respectively. For consistency, we count the number of unique TRs in a genome (i.e. unique non-overlapping sequences that fulfill the TR definition). TR-proteins sum all proteins that contain at least one TR-segment (TR-segment, TR-seg). The minimal
TR-segment is composed of at least 3 successive TR-units. (B) Statistical comparison of N. vectensis and D. melanogaster TRproteomes.

Proteins A7SW76 and A7S5V7 (UniProt IDs) share a
repeated unit of 49 amino acids (yellow box) with a copy
number of 3.5 and 4. In addition, two other repeated
units are found in A7SW76, with a copy number of 6 (7
amino acids unit) and 3 (21 amino acids unit). The
remaining portions of the proteins are not identified as
TRs. TR-units are defined by at least 3 repeated units, each
with a minimal length of 3 amino acids, with no intervening sequences. These are non-overlapping sequences that
are identified according to the Xstream tool [20] (see
Methods). The number of unique TRs may differ from that
of TR-proteins as the same TR-unit might occur in numerous proteins and the same TR-unit often appears in several
segments on a particular protein (Figure 1).
We compared the occurrence of protein TR sequences in
N. vectensis in view of other complete proteomes, including fly (D. melanogaster), human, mouse, frog, and more.
We restricted our analysis to those TRs for which all

repeats share >80% sequence identity with the respective
consensus repeat sequence (see Methods).
The complete proteome of N. vectensis includes 24,906
predicted proteins, where half of these are marked as fragments. The number of proteins identified with TRs was as
high as 3875, of which 3315 are unique TR-units. When
comparing the TRs in N. vectensis and other proteomes,
the most striking difference is in the number of unique
TRs. In N. vectensis, ~16% of all protein sequences are TRcontaining proteins. When employing the same parameters, TR containing sequences account for only 3% of the
Drosophila melanogaster proteome (Figure 1B).
An exhaustive comparison of the TR properties for representative proteomes, spanning an evolutionary range
from N. vectensis to human, was performed. The selected
organisms represent major evolutionary branches, covering worm (C. elegans), insects (fly, bee and beetle), plant

(Arabidopsis), vertebrate (chicken, frog), marine chordata
(Ciona), cnidaria (Hydra), mammals (human, mouse),
metazoan parasite (Leishmania) and choanoflagellate
(M. brevicollis).
When the fraction of TR containing proteins (TR-proteins)
relative to the total Nematostella proteome is considered
(Figure 2A), we noted a 2-5 fold enrichment in the fraction of such proteins relative to the other organisms
tested.
Most N. vectensis tandem repeat units are unique
While the fraction of TR-proteins in N. vectensis is higher
than in any other tested organism, the usage of any particular TR is typically restricted. Most TR-units are used only
once in N. vectensis (Figure 2B). In mouse and human,
each TR appears on average in 2.7 and 2.1 proteins,
respectively. For example, in the mouse proteome, there
are ~3000 TR-proteins, yet they are composed of only
~1100 unique TRs. While the genomes of human and
mouse are quite active in reusing their repeated sequences
[27], no clear view was presented for the dynamics of TRs
in N. vectensis [22]. Moreover, the fraction occupied by a
TR within the TR-protein (i.e., TR-coverage) is substantially higher in N. vectensis (Figure 2C). This extreme TRcoverage (50%) reflects the fact that almost half of N. vectensis proteins are marked as fragments due to missing
exons (and failures of genome prediction tools). The 25%
coverage measured for human (Figure 2C) and mouse
(not shown) is still higher than the coverage determined
for the other organisms tested, mainly insects and frog.
Characterizing the properties of TR-containing proteins
from N. vectensis
The >3300 TRs of N. vectensis were statistically analyzed to
determine the most prevalent repeat properties in terms of
number of TR units, their length, and the overall regions
they occupy. Figure 3 shows the abundance of these TRunits. It is evident that a unit length of 10-12 amino acids
is most prevalent (Figure 3A). Furthermore, an inverse
correlation is observed between the number of TR-units
within a TR-segment (defined in Figure 1) and the length
of that basic unit (tested for a range of 6-20 amino acids).
Thus, in most cases, the total region that is occupied by
TRs in N. vectensis remains within the range of 120 to 180
amino acids (Figure 3B, pink). The average length of a TRsegment in a protein is 153 amino acids. Figure 3C shows
the accumulated level of variations relative to the TR consensus, where TRs with deviations ranging from 0 to accumulated changes in 20% of its amino acids (marked 0.2)
are analyzed. The TRs from human and N. vectensis demonstrate clear differences. While most TRs in human have
diverged substantially, this is not the case for N. vectensis
(peaks at 0.06). It is possible that TRs in human and N.
vectensis differ in their tendency to accumulate and main-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/593

tain variations. A substantial number of TRs in human
(229) and in N. vectensis (235) shows no variations
(marked 0) but most of them (80%) are short TRs (<6
amino acids). An attractive idea suggests that the higher
variation observed in mouse (not shown) and human
(Figure 3C) coincide with the high usability of each TRunit in human and mouse but not in Nematostella (Figure
2B). A similar trend was proposed for the accelerated evolution of duplicated paralogous genes [28]. A similar analysis performed for the ~1200 TR-segments of Hydra
indicated an intermediate rate of variation (Additional file
1).
We expanded the comparative study to proteomes that are
evolutionarily closer to N. vectensis, such as Hydra.
Recently, a Hydra genome (H. magnipapillata) was
sequenced and a predicted protein set of 17,586 models
was presented (Craig Venter Institute, ~6X sequence coverage, 1.3 Gb genome). The fraction of unique TR-units
within the Hydra complete proteome is ~5% (Table 1).
The difference in the absolute number of proteins and the
fraction of proteins marked as 'fragments' (Table 1) is a
proxy for the knowledge and annotation quality (exceptions are missing annotations for L. major and Hydra). The
high fraction of partial proteins (i.e., 47% 'fragments' for
N. vectensis) is consistent with their shorter average length
(Table 1). We included in the analysis Leishmania major, a
protozoan parasite that underwent rapid evolution and
for which many proteins are known to contain TRs. Table
1 shows that the exceptionally high proportion of proteins with TRs in N. vectensis is a unique property of this
organism and has not been reported to such an extent
even in protozoan parasites.
To ensure that the trends seen in Table 1 do not solely
reflect the poor quality of the assembly and protein annotations reported [29], we repeated the analysis but eliminated all sequences that include undefined nucleotides
(indicated by nucleotide 'x') or sequences that could not
match exactly their transcripts (see Methods). Even after
such filtration, the fraction of TRs for N. vectensis still
remains exceptionally high (11% of the entire proteome).
Amino acid composition of N. vectensis tandem repeats
We analyzed the over-representation and under-representation of amino acids in TR-proteins, in comparison with
all other N. vectensis proteins. We found that several
amino acids, most notably histidine (H), cysteine (C),
tyrosine (Y), proline (P), and threonine (T) were enriched,
with C and H being the most significantly so (Figure 4).
On the other hand, we observed that polar and charged
amino acids are strongly depleted in the TR sequences.
Specifically, the most depleted amino acids are phenylalanine (F), glutamic acid (E), and lysine (K). Similar

enrichment and depletion in amino acid preference were
evident when compared to the SwissProt database
(~400,000 sequences). In addition to the distinct biophysical properties of these under-represented amino
acids, it is of interest that their codons tends to be AT rich
and they are mostly coded by a limited number of codons
(2 codons each).
A significant difference in amino acid composition exists
between N. vectensis TR and non-TR proteins (Figure 4A).
We thus tested whether the amino acid composition in
TRs of N. vectensis is similar to that of other organisms.
Specifically, we compared the N. vectensis TRs to the ~970
unique TRs from human. When comparing the TR
sequences (Figure 4B), a relative enrichment in tyrosine
(Y) is evident, and to a lesser extent C, I, L, and V. Interestingly, relative to the human repeats, the TRs from N. vectensis are more enriched with amino acids that tend to
form ordered structures (Figure 4B, blue), suggesting that
these repeats may be better suited to form structural units.
Similar trends were evident in comparisons with other
vertebrate TR-proteins. The most dominant predicted secondary structure associated with the TR repeats is the βsheet (not shown).
Sequence robustness of tandem repeats revealed by
multiple open reading frames
Among the 24,906 ORFs predicted for N. vectensis [22],
3875 TR-proteins were selected (Table 1). We tested the
extent of valid alternative reading frames among this large
set of TR-proteins. In fact, due to the shortage in experimental evidence (ESTs and cDNAs), and the absence of
any direct protein information, the reading frame may not
be correct. Typically, computational inference for a spe-

cific frame is based on an appropriate Kozak sequence
near the initiating methionine, on the knowledge of
codon usage bias, and on conservation criteria from
homology and paralogy. At present, ~50% of the TR-proteins lack an initiating methionine and a similar fraction
(45%) holds for the rest of the predicted proteins.
We analyzed the properties of the alternative reading
frames for TR-proteins. For this analysis, the set of all TRsegments from N. Vectensis was compiled (4437 segments,
JGI proteome). For each such TR-segment, we inspected
all alternative reading frames (ARFs), a total of 22,185
potential ORFs. Averaging over all 5 frame shifts, 37.5% of
these ARFs do not contain a stop codon (Figure 5A), i.e.,
they adhere to the minimal definition of being valid
ORFs. To put this result within a statistical context, we performed a simulation for 4437 random ORF sequences,
generated based on the nucleotide composition of the
coding sequences of the N. vectensis TR-proteins. In this
random simulation, only 4.3% of the ARFs did not contain a stop codon, thus hinting at the possible significance
of this beneficial use of repeated sequences to yield valid
ARFs. Somewhat surprisingly, the high fraction of valid
ARFs also carried over for those of the reverse complement
strand (Figure 5A). In our analysis, we found that only
~600 TR-proteins (14%) can be read exclusively in the
annotated reading frame. On the other hand, for most of
the sequences, there are at least 2-3 additional ORFs (Figure 5B), many of which are potentially long. For example,
when limiting the analysis to ARFs (ORF +2 or ORF +3)
with length >500 nucleotides, 107 such instances were
found (Additional file 2).

Evolutionary conserved N. vectensis TR-units. (A) A
schematic phylogenetic tree showing the main branches in
metazoan origin. Proteomes that are compared are indicated
in blue. (B) N. vectensis shares 160 TR-units with human and
112 TR-units with mouse. Mouse and human share 343 TRs,
among which 64 are shared by all three organisms. (C) Hydra
magnipapillata TR-proteins were compared to N. vectensis. 83
TR-units are shared between these two organisms. N. vectensis and M. brevicollis share 74 TR-proteins. 41 proteins are
shared among all three organisms. For the list of shared proteins, see Additional file 3.

An analysis of the TR-proteins showed that the overall
amino acid composition is rather similar for all 3 reading
frames on the coding strand, when the alternative frames
are open; (Figure 5C, p-value for paired t-test <0.007).
Note that in cases when the reverse complement frames
are also valid, the translated sequences are also often similar in composition to the original frame (see Discussion).
It is important to note that there is a unique scenario, for
which repeats of a nucleotide unit will necessarily result in
the same amino acid sequence for all 3 reading frames on
a strand, with cyclic shifts only in the start and end of the
sequence. Figure 5D demonstrates an example where a
repeat of 13 nucleotides leads to a TR-unit of 13 amino
acids. This phenomenon is actually a byproduct of the
basic repeat unit (at the DNA level) having any length that
is not a multiple of 3. We found that only for 18% of all
TR-proteins (806 instances) was this phenomenon
present. Clearly, in such cases, the amino acid composition will remain fixed. Nonetheless, we found the composition to be fixed for almost all TR-proteins (Figure 5C).
Limited conservation of N. vectensis TR-units along the
phylogenetic tree
We tested to what extent the 3300 TRs from N. vectensis is
evolutionarily conserved. We focused on representative
proteomes for comparison with N. vectensis. Figure 6A
shows a tree view of the major branches from the metazoan-fungi separation and within the metazoa kingdom.
The Venn diagrams of TR-proteins indicate the number of
TR-proteins that are shared among human, mouse, and
Nematostella (Figure 6B). A broader evolutionary perspective is presented by comparing Nematostella with
Hydra (Cnidaria) and Monosiga (Figure 6C). Shared TRproteins are defined by the identity of their TR-units, as
calculated by Xstream [20]. We noted that even human
and mouse share only 343 TR-proteins, while the overlap
between N. vectensis and human and N. vectensis and
mouse is even lower (160 and 112, respectively). The
analysis of unique TRs shows that 6% of the unique TRs
from N. vectensis are also found in human and mouse

(Figure 6B). Among these, only 64 TR-proteins are shared
among all 3 proteomes. While some of the TR-units that
are shared among the tested proteomes are rather long,
~50-60% of them are shorter than 7 amino acids. A similar comparison relative to the Hydra proteome indicated
that 10% and 7.4% of the TR-proteins are shared with
Hydra and Monosiga, respectively (Figure 6C). Only 20
TR-proteins are conserved among all 5 tested species. We
concluded that a limited number of TR-units are shared in
evolution and the expansion of the TR-proteome is indicative of Nematostella and to a much lesser degree of
Hydra. For more details, see Additional file 3.
Expression of TR-proteins from N. vectensis: the multiubiquitin proteins
Table 2 summarizes instances of TRs that are shared
among N. vectensis, human, and mouse and additional
organisms. Among the longest TRs that were identified in
human, mouse, and N. vectensis (with almost no variability in their sequence) is a repeat of 76 amino acids that
represents multi-ubiquitin proteins. For example, D. mel-

anogaster has 4 proteins with such TR-units, with copy
number (n) of 4 (Q8MT02), 7 (Q9W418) 10 (A4V1F9)
and 14 (Q8MSM5). In N. vectensis, this TR-unit is detected
in 2 independent sequences with a copy number of 3 and
7 units (A7SV54 and A7SUP6, respectively). This ubiquitin domain of 76 amino acids appears within a wide spectrum of the taxonomical tree. Representative proteins
containing this TR, with n = 3 to 17, are shown in Table 2.
Hs1-Cortactin is a TR of 37 amino acids that appears with
n = 3 to 7. The 114 amino acid repeat of Calx-beta appears
in 7 protein sequences in N. vectensis. It is widely spread
throughout the taxa, ranging in copy number from 3 to
41. The Calx-beta motif is present in the cytoplasmic
domains of Na-Ca exchangers and in integrin-β4, which
mediates signaling across the plasma membrane (see
Additional file 4). In all these examples, the TR units are
those reported by the Pfam family collection [30]. All N.
vectensis examples listed in Table 2 are supported experimentally and confirmed by EST expressions from embryo,
larva, and unfertilized egg (not shown).

A functional perspective of N. vectensis repeats
The fraction of Pfam and InterPro entries that are represented among all N. vectensis proteins is slightly lower
than that for well-studied genomes (68% compared to
77% for all proteins in UniProt). When the set of TR-proteins is considered, only 31% appear with a Pfam entry
that is repeated at least twice. Thus, most of the TR-proteins are undefined by Pfam and InterPro databases. Of
course, the strict requirement of tandemness in the TRs
excludes proteins with non-conserved linkers between
domains (e.g., Annexin repeats) from the analysis.

humans, no marked difference in copy number is shown
for most of these repeats (Figure 7). For 2 such repeat
domains, N. vectensis exhibits a moderate preference for a
higher copy number. For almost half of the instances, the
opposite tendency is detected. Since many of the N. vectensis proteins are incomplete (i.e., annotated as fragments), this analysis may underestimate the actual copy
number of the TRs in the full sequences. We conclude
that, overall, the copy numbers for the Pfam repeats that
are well-represented in N. vectensis are rather similar to the
copy numbers of these repeats in human (Figure 7).

We thus set out to test the appearance of repeats in the N.
vectensis proteome in view of the 252 repeat types that are
reported by InterPro (Additional file 5). Most of the
repeats that are supported by Pfam (63%, see Methods)
are not found in N. vectensis. For those found in N. vectensis, we focused on the 16 repeat types that are represented
by at least 20 proteins in N. vectensis. When compared to

Evolutionary divergence rate for tandem repeat units
The large number of TR-proteins in N. vectensis and the
observation that they are mostly uniquely used in its proteins raises the question: which evolutionary forces act on
such repeats? We set out to study whether the evolution of
these tandem repeats has been subject to neutral, purifying, or positive selection. We thus applied an analysis

based on the ratio of asynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks ratio). Due to the shortage of experimental evidence for many of the predicted proteins from N.
vectensis, we limited this analysis to the TR-proteins that
are supported by ESTs (obtained from JGI genome
center). For the 94 sequences analyzed, ~40% of them
exhibit a ratio of Ka/Ks > 1.0, while ~50% show the opposite trend. Among the instances of TR-proteins with Ka/
Ks>1, several of them seem to exhibit extremely high
ratios, which strongly supports the notion of positive
selection on these tandem repeats.

Discussion
N. vectensis proteome quality and missing annotations
All analyses we performed for the N. vectensis and H. magnipapillata TR-proteins are susceptible to the quality of
assembly from the shotgun libraries [29]. The genome of
N. vectensis is composed of a large number of disconnected contigs. Transposable elements constitute ~26% of
the assembled genome, and they are associated with ~500
families that are considered evolutionary young. The
number of DNA transposon types found in the sea anemone is the highest among eukaryotic species [31].

In N. vectensis, only 146,000 ESTs were used to support
the proteome annotation. These ESTs led to the validation
of ~8000 protein sequences. In addition, ~15,000 paired
clone end sequences were generated, resulting in 27,273
predicted gene models. It has been estimated that about a
third of the predicted proteins may be subjected to future
annotation efforts [22]. We conducted our analysis on
24,906 proteins that are supported by UniProtKB (~91%
of JGI predicted proteins). About 2000 TR-proteins are
reported following an analysis using stricter criteria (for
sequences that do not contain any undefined nucleotides
or gaps in the TR consensus). Currently, collections from
Cnidaria ESTs (sea fans and soft coral) are available: Anemonia viridis (~40,000), Metridium senile (~30,000), and
Acropora palmate (~14,000); and Porites astreoides, Aiptasia
pallida, Acropora millepora with ~10,000 ESTs each. We
expect that the coverage of TRs in N. vectensis (Figure 2C)
will be revised upon improved annotations and additional experimental data. We are currently testing the
expression of predicted TR-proteins from N. vectensis.
DNA repeats as a source of novel coding sequences
Most multicellular eukaryotic genomes contain repetitive
sequences. These sequences provide the basis for the study
of genome dynamics, recombination, and gene conversion [32]. In general, DNA repeats are believed to serve as
a principal source of gene novelty. Repetitive nucleotide
sequences such as micro- and mini-satellites have been
subjected to rapid gains and losses throughout evolution
[15].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/593

A survey on internal repeats in protein sequence databases
[33] indicated that eukaryotes have a 3-4 fold higher incidence of internal repeats, as compared to prokaryotes or
archaea [34]. Furthermore, long proteins often resulted
from the concatenation of internal TRs. We propose that
the N. vectensis TR basic architectures are attractive for creating new proteins through recombination and copy
number adjustment. For a simple sequence (devoid of
TRs) above a certain length, it is rare to detect valid ARFs.
Usually, only one ORF (the correct one) can be found,
while frame shifts of this ORF are unavoidably punctuated
by stop codons. However, we noted that for ~800 TR
instances, both ARF frame +2 and frame +3 are valid as
ORFs.
It was recently suggested that ~40 long overlooked ARFs
are expressed in humans [35], in addition to several previously studied ARFs (GNAS1, XBP1, and INK4). When we
applied similar criteria to identify ARF candidates among
N. vectensis TR-proteins, 107 such instances were found
(Additional file 2). The average fraction of valid ARFs for
the TR-proteins in N. vectensis is disproportionately high
(37.5%), when considering only the size distribution of
these proteins. The analysis of all TR-proteins shows that
all 3 frames provide a rather similar overall picture (pvalue < 0.007, Figure 5C) of amino acid composition,
even when this is not mathematically guaranteed.
The probability for a stop codon (in alternative frames
and antisense strand) decreases as GC content increases
[36]. In Nematostella TR-proteins, the strong bias towards
multiple ORFs was not associated with high GC content.
The GC content for the TR-units is similar to that of the
proteome as a whole (47.4%). For humans, the GC content of the entire proteome is higher (52.7%) and similar
to that of its TR units (51.9%). We conclude that the
length of TRs and their complexity is not a reflection of the
GC content.
Tandem repeats with structural and functional
characteristics
The energetics and kinetics of TR-containing proteins provide new insights into folding rates and protein stability
[37]. In N. vectensis, the TR-units are of an average length
of 10-12 amino acids (Figure 3A), but a TR-segment is of
~150 amino acids on average (Figure 3B). This is in the
range of a foldable unit and the size of most structural global units in proteins [38]. For most TRs, there is no functional or structural information. In fact, the annotation of
'predicted protein' covers 96% of the N. vectensis proteins
and 99.9% of the TR-proteins.

We tested the TR segments of N. vectensis for their secondary structure propensities using the Jpred3 server [39]. For
this analysis, we used all valid ARF sequences that were at

Page 13 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:593

least 100 amino acids long (296 such sequences in total).
Since Jpred, as other prediction methods, strongly rely on
homology through PSI-BLAST, it was not surprising that
for most ARFs, no globular homolog was found. On average, 83% of the positions were predicted as disordered
coils (C), 7% of the positions predicted as beta sheet (E),
and 10% as alpha helix (H). Nonetheless, some of these
ARFs (20 of them) were predicted to have between 30%
and 74% beta sheet, and others (25 ARFs) 52%-97%
alpha helix. Interestingly, most InterPro-defined repeat
domains are >30 amino acids long and form non-globular
elongated structures. Structure-based functionality of
these repeated domains has been illustrated for tetratricopeptide (TPR) [40] and spectrin [41]. Specifically,
some repeats serve as building blocks in superstructure
and thus steric constraints limit the expansion of the
repeated units [11].
The parameters used in this study for identification of TRproteins in N. vectensis excluded most of the Pfam
domains [42]. However, overall, the Pfam-defined
repeated domains from N. vectensis exhibit a copy number
similar to their mammalian counterparts (Figure 7). At
present, the validated number of repeated TR elements in
N. vectensis cannot be determined. We expect a fraction of
them to be eliminated following an exhaustive transcriptomic study. On the other hand, TRs with low sequence
identity (<80% amino acid identity with the consensus)
were not considered in our study.
Currently, functional information for N. vectensis (i.e., GO
annotations [43]) is very limited. Annotations that
appears in >40 proteins are sparse and include 'Zinc ion
binding' (46 proteins), 'G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling' (42 proteins), and 'Calcium binding' (45
proteins). While the overlap of N. vectensis TR-units with
TR-units from Hydra is rather limited (Figure 6A), about
50 of the TR-units are shared only among Cnidaria representatives and are not detected in human or mouse (Additional file 3).
Evolution dynamics - expansion and deletion of repeated
units
Representative genomes from Porifera (sponges) have
provided molecular information on the evolutionarily
oldest, yet still extant, phylum. Analysis of the genomes of
Demospongiae (Suberites domuncula and Geodia cydonium), Calcarea (Sycon raphanus), and Hexactinellida
(Aphrocallistes vastus) revealed an increase in gene number
due to a burst of gene duplication events. This process was
accompanied by efficient domain shuffling. This gave rise
to the evolution of new domains (i.e., adhesion molecules) and elements of adaptive immunity [23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/593

We have shown that the expansion and contraction of
repeats carries the potential for an increase in functional
variability. The large numbers of TR-segments and additional repeated units in N. vectensis proteome may have an
impact on the fitness of Nematostella to cope with the environment. We noted a wide variation in the extent of
repeats throughout the evolutionary tree (Table 2). Repeat
expansion has shaped many families of proteins (e.g., leucine-rich repeats [33]). The mechanism that underlies the
gain and loss of TRs (of the type and size discussed in this
study) is most likely a non-reciprocal mode of recombination and gene conversion. Over evolutionary time, gene
conversion within repeated sequences has been an important mode in shaping eukaryotic genomes [44]. It is likely
that most TR-units in the representative organisms studied
(Figure 6) have evolved independently. The TR-proteins
that are shared between human, mouse, hydra, sponge,
choanoflagellate, and sea anemone genomes serve as a
basis to study the process of their evolution. Exciting
examples for the importance of the actual numbers of TRunits within coding sequences are known from yeast to
human [45,46].

Conclusions
The proteome of Nematostella vectensis is uniquely characterized in terms of its tandemly repeated amino acid
sequences. About 3000 TR-units from N. vectensis were
identified, a number that exceeds all other multicellular
organisms tested. Comparing TR-proteins to additional
representatives of metazoan origin (Hydra and Monosiga)substantiated the uniqueness of the phenomenon
in N. vectensis but also confirmed that TR-units are in general less conserved even among closely related organisms
(human and mouse). We suggest that the TR-proteins
present in early metazoan life may have served as a robust
source for novel genes with previously overlooked characteristics. These TR-proteins have unique properties in term
of amino acid composition, structural properties, and
evolutionary dynamics. As such, they may have unexpectedly functioned as a distinctive and rich origin for gene
novelty within the framework of animal evolution.

Methods
Data Sources
For the complete Nematostella proteome, we used UniProtKB [47] covering 24,906 proteins (UniProt version
14.0). For each predicted protein, the translated cDNA
sequence was extracted from the complete genome of N.
vectensis from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI). The cDNA
sequences of all other organisms analyzed were extracted
from Ensembl using BioMart and its script suite [48].

The data used for assessment of ORF properties and for
measuring the DNA sequence divergence rate (Ka/Ks)
excluded those proteins for which the amino acid

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:593

sequence and its corresponding cDNA conflicted. 19,283
sequences from the JGI sea anemone genome project version 1.0 http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ are associated with
their protein sequence. Each of the ORF sequences was
matched with the cDNA sequence and genome positioning (when available). Analyses were performed on this
proteome-genome matched set. The sequences of the TRsegments were extracted to create a TR-only collection.
This set covers 40% (of the amino acids) of the original
data presented by the N. vectensis JGI complete genome.
Bioinformatics resources
For sequence comparison, we applied NCBI resources and
tools including Gene [49], NCBI-BLAST2 ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ and the JGI genome browser
http://genome.jgi-psf.org. Functional annotations are
based on InterPro and Pfam assignments. Pfam annotations from StellaBase [42] include 7868 entries for the
entire proteome. Using annotations from the UniProtKB
cross-reference indicates that 68% of all predicted proteins from N. vectensis have at least one PfamA entry. InterPro version 20.0 [10] lists 18,469 entries, 252 of them
assigned as 'repeats'. 49 InterPro entries have no Pfam
support and were not further analyzed. The rest of the
repeats (203 entries, covering 175,000 UniProt proteins)
were analyzed according to InterPro, GO 'molecular function' and 'biological process' terms, and Enzyme Classification (EC), as obtained from the UniProtKB resource.
Prediction methods and tools
Tandem repeats
The locations of TRs in the proteins and the transcripts
were determined using the Xstream web tool [20]. The
parameters of Xstream for protein are (i) TRs are >70%
identical (ii) The minimal length of the repeated unit is 3
amino acids (iii) The minimal domain length (defined as
the total length of the repeated units) is 10 (iv) the
repeated unit appears at least 3 times (v) each repeat unit
shares >80% identity to the consensus sequence; (vi) there
are at most 3 gaps in the repeats. For nucleic acids, the
parameters that define TRs are (i) TRs are >70% identical
(ii) The unit is of a minimal length of 10 nucleotides (iii)
the minimal domain length is 30 nucleotides. Parameters
iv-vi are identical for both proteins and nucleic acids.
Divergence rate
To calculate synonymous (Ks) and asynonymous (Ka)
substitution rates, we used the Ka/Ks Calculator developed by the Beijing Genomics Institute [50]. The Ka/Ks
ratio compares the rates of asynonymous and synonymous substitutions. A ratio that is <1 indicates that asynonymous mutations tend to be removed from the
population. Positive selection (i.e., adaptive evolution)
generates a ratio >1. For Ka/Ks measurement, we used
only the ~400 TR-proteins that have EST evidence. For

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/593

each protein, the Ka/Ks ratio was calculated relative to the
first repeat unit, which was used as a reference. TR-proteins that show a variation rate <0.05 and TRs that are very
short were excluded from the analysis, leaving 94
sequences.
Amino Acid properties
Composition Profiler [51] was applied for the analysis of
amino acid properties for the TR-proteins, where the basic
concept is to compare the amino acid probabilities estimated from a protein sample relative to those estimated
from a background sample. P-values are calculated based
on the hypothesis that the amino acid composition of the
samples comes from the same underlying distribution
(corrected for multiple tests). We used a set of 500 randomly chosen non-repeat proteins from the N. vectensis
proteome as a background for the composition profile of
ORF +1, and another such set for the similarities between
the compositions for all 3 ORFs. Note that the composition for ORF +1 was nearly identical as compared to either
background.
Statistical estimation and measurement
In order to estimate the statistical significance of the
number of valid (with open reading frame) ARFs per protein, we used simulated protein data. To construct such a
protein in silico, we created a randomized set of protein
sequences and rejected sequences containing stop codons
in the first frame, thus exclusively generating proteins for
which ORF+1 is valid. Based on the length distribution of
the TR segments of the 4337 TR-proteins taken from the
actual data, we created 4337 such simulated proteins. For
each such protein, we evaluated all possible reading
frames, and tallied the appearance of stop codons.
