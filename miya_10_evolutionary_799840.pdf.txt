Abstract
Background: The teleost order Lophiiformes, commonly known as the anglerfishes, contains a diverse array of
marine fishes, ranging from benthic shallow-water dwellers to highly modified deep-sea midwater species. They
comprise 321 living species placed in 68 genera, 18 families and 5 suborders, but approximately half of the species
diversity is occupied by deep-sea ceratioids distributed among 11 families. The evolutionary origins of such
remarkable habitat and species diversity, however, remain elusive because of the lack of fresh material for a
majority of the deep-sea ceratioids and incompleteness of the fossil record across all of the Lophiiformes. To
obtain a comprehensive picture of the phylogeny and evolutionary history of the anglerfishes, we assembled
whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from 39 lophiiforms (33 newly determined during this
study) representing all five suborders and 17 of the 18 families. Sequences of 77 higher teleosts including the 39
lophiiform sequences were unambiguously aligned and subjected to phylogenetic analysis and divergence time
estimation.
Results: Partitioned maximum likelihood analysis confidently recovered monophyly for all of the higher taxa
(including the order itself) with the exception of the Thaumatichthyidae (Lasiognathus was deeply nested within
the Oneirodidae). The mitogenomic trees strongly support the most basal and an apical position of the Lophioidei
and a clade comprising Chaunacoidei + Ceratioidei, respectively, although alternative phylogenetic positions of the
remaining two suborders (Antennarioidei and Ogcocephaloidei) with respect to the above two lineages are
statistically indistinguishable. While morphology-based intra-subordinal relationships for relatively shallow, benthic
dwellers (Lophioidei, Antennarioidei, Ogcocephaloidei, Chaunacoidei) are either congruent with or statistically
indistinguishable from the present mitogenomic tree, those of the principally deep-sea midwater dwellers
(Ceratioidei) cannot be reconciled with the molecular phylogeny. A relaxed molecular-clock Bayesian analysis of the
divergence times suggests that all of the subordinal diversifications have occurred during a relatively short time
period between 100 and 130 Myr ago (early to mid Cretaceous).
Conclusions: The mitogenomic analyses revealed previously unappreciated phylogenetic relationships among the
lophiiform suborders and ceratioid familes. Although the latter relationships cannot be reconciled with the earlier
hypotheses based on morphology, we found that simple exclusion of the reductive or simplified characters can
alleviate some of the conflict. The acquisition of novel features, such as male dwarfism, bioluminescent lures, and
unique reproductive modes allowed the deep-sea ceratioids to diversify rapidly in a largely unexploited, food-poor
bathypelagic zone (200-2000 m depth) relative to the other lophiiforms occurring in shallow coastal areas.

Background
The order Lophiiformes contains a diverse array of marine fishes, ranging from benthic shallow-water dwellers
to several groups of deep-shelf and slope inhabitants as
well as a highly modified assemblage of open-water,
meso- and bathypelagic species. Commonly referred to
as anglerfishes, the group is characterized most strikingly by the structure of the first dorsal-fin spine, typically placed out on the tip of the snout and modified to
serve as a luring apparatus for the attraction of prey.
The order comprises approximately 325 living species,
distributed among 68 genera and 18 families (Table 1).
The families themselves are distributed among five suborders [1-3]: the Lophioidei (one family), relatively shallow-water, dorso-ventrally flattened forms, commonly
referred to as the goosefishes or monkfishes (Figure 1A);
the Antennarioidei (four families), nearly all laterally
compressed, shallow- to moderately deep-water, benthic
forms, with a host of common names including frogfishes (Figure 1B), sea-mice, sea-toads, warty anglerfishes, and handfishes (Figure 1C); the Chaunacoidei or
coffinfishes (one family), more or less globose, deepwater benthic forms (Figure 1D); the Ogcocephaloidei
or batfishes (one family), dorsoventrally flattened, deepwater benthic forms (Figure 1E); and the Ceratioidei (11
families), the deep-sea anglerfishes (Figures 2, 3), characterized most distinctly by their extremely dwarfed males
attaching themselves (either temporarily or permanently)
to the bodies of relatively gigantic females [4].

Within the higher teleosts, the Lophiiformes has traditionally been allied with toadfishes of the order Batrachoidiformes, based primarily on osteological characters
of the cranium [5-7]. Following the publication of the
seminal work on higher-level relationships of teleosts by
Greenwood et al. [8] and the advent of cladistic theory
[9], both groups have been placed in the Paracanthopterygii, a presumed sister-group of the more derived
Acanthopterygii [7]. Other than the Lophiiformes and
Batrachoidiformes, the original Paracanthopterygii [7]
included those groups of fishes thought to be relatively
primitive in the higher teleosts, such as Polymixiiformes,
Percopsiformes, Ophidiiformes, Gadiformes, Zeioidei,
Zoarcoidei and Gobiesocoidei. Subsequently, the taxonomic contents of the Paracanthopterygii have undergone significant changes, being finally reduced to five
core orders (Percopsiformes, Ophidiiformes, Gadiformes,
Batrachoidiformes, Lophiiformes) in an attempt to make
the group monophyletic [10], and this taxonomic proposal has been followed in many reference books [11-14].
Thus the paracanthopterygian Lophiiformes (and its
close association with the Batrachoidiformes) has been a
prevailing view in the ichthyological community despite
the lack of convincing evidence [1,15,16].
Recent molecular phylogenetic studies, however, have
repeatedly cast doubt on such a paracanthoperygian
position of the Lophiiformes within the higher teleosts
[17-27]. These studies based on nucleotide sequences
from both whole mitogenomes and various nuclear
genes have strongly suggested that lophiiforms are
highly derived teleosts, deeply nested in one of the larger percomorph clades, and that they are closely related
to various percomorphs, such as the Tetraodontiformes,
Caproidei, Acanthuroidei, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Ephippidae and Drepanidae, all of them showing no
indications of close affinity with the Lophiiformes before
the advent of molecular phylogenetics. Significantly a
mitochondrial phylogenomic study by Miya et al. [25]
demonstrated that the Batrachoidiformes was deeply
nested within a different percomorph clade consisting of
the Synbranchiformes and Indostomiidae and a sistergroup relationship between the Lophiiformes and Batrachoidiformes was confidently rejected by the Bayesian
analyses. These novel relationships, however, have not
been reflected in the most recently published classification of fishes [14].
Within the Lophiiformes, interrelationships among 18
families and five suborders have been inadequately studied, owing to limited availability of specimens from the
most taxonomically rich suborder Ceratioidei. Nevertheless Pietsch and his colleagues [1,3,28] have analyzed
morphological characters in several attempts to resolve
subordinal and family relationships. In their preferred
cladogram, the Lophioidei occupies the most basal

Page 5 of 27

position, followed by Antennarioidei and Chaunacoidei,
with the Ogcocephaloidei and Ceratioidei forming a sister-group at the top of the tree (Figure 4A). More
recently Shedlock et al. [29] compared short fragments
of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA genes from 18 lophiiforms including all five suborders, and analyzed 513
aligned nucleotide sites using the maximum likelihood
(ML) method, with two batrachoidiforms species as outgroups. The resulting tree (Figure 4B), however, significantly departed from both the results based on
morphological (Figure 4A) and molecular data [24-26],
although the latter studies dealt with only six species in
three suborders (Lophioidei, Chaunacoidei, Ceratioidei).
Within each subordinal lineage, several authors have
published phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphological characters (Figure 4C-G), including those of Caruso [30] for the Lophioidei, Pietsch and Grobecker [3]
for the Antennarioidei, Endo and Shinohara [31] for the
Ogcocephaloidei, Bertelsen [32] and Pietsch and Orr
[33], and Pietsch [2] for the Ceratioidei. There has been
no attempt, however, to resolve their phylogenies using
molecular data.
In addition to the lack of available material of numerous rare taxa, the evolutionary history of the lophiiform
fishes has remained elusive because of poor representation in the fossil record (but see [34-38]). Recent developments in the molecular estimation of divergence
times, however, have provided promising tools to introduce time scales for the phylogenetic trees [39], thereby
offering new insights into evolutionary history that cannot be inferred by the fossil data alone. Among the
most significant advances common to these new methods is a departure from the molecular clock assumption
and the use of time constraints at multiple nodes for
rate calibration, usually based on fossil record. In higher
teleosts, however, including lophiiforms, the fossil
record is scarce and fragmentary, and alternative calibration points based on biogeographic events have proven
useful for divergence time estimation. Azuma et al. [40]
recently found that estimated divergence times of cichlid
fishes showed excellent agreement with the history of
Gondwanian fragmentation, arguing that such biogeographic events can be used as effective time constraints
in dating teleostean divergences, which may be useful
for dating lophiiform divergence times.
To address questions regarding the subordinal and
familial relationships and evolutionary history of the
Lophiiformes, we assembled the whole mitochondrial
genome sequences from the 39 lophiiform species (33
sequences newly-determined during this study), representing all of the five suborders and 17 of the 18
families. Unambiguously aligned sequences (14,611 bp)
from those 39 species plus 38 outgroups (total 77 species) were subjected to partitioned maximum likelihood

patterns and rates of diversifications.

Methods
Taxon sampling

Our taxon sampling followed results from recent mitochondrial phylogenomic studies by Miya et al. [25,26]
who first proposed that the Lophiiformes was a highly

advanced percomorph group and confidently rejected
their affinity with paracanthopterygians. They also proposed that the order was closely related to members of
previously unallied groups such as Caproidei and Tetraodontiformes, a hypothesis that was subsequently supported by Yamanoue et al. [27] in their study of
Tetraodontiformes based on the 44 whole mitogenome
sequences. Thus, in the present study, we incorporated
all of the 44 species (including six lophiiforms) used by
Yamanoue et al. [27] and added 33 species of lophiiforms for a total 77 species (Table 2). Despite limited

availability of fresh materials from bathypelagic ceratioids, we were able to collect tissues of all 11 families,
lacking for the entire order only the rare monotypic
antennarioid family Lophichthyidae (Table 1). Accordingly, we sampled all of the five suborders, 17 of the 18
families (94.4%), 33 of the 68 genera (48.5%), and 39 of
the 321 species (12.1%), a coverage sufficient to address
higher-level relationships of the Lophiiformes. We
acknowledge that the taxon sampling is still sparse for
three species-rich families, the Antennariidae (6.7%),
Ogcocephalidae (5.9%), and Oneirodidae (6.3%) (see
Table 1). The final rooting was done using a non-percomorph Polymixia japonica (Polymixiidae).
DNA extraction, PCR, and Sequencing

We excised a small piece of epaxial musculature or finray (ca. 0.25 g) from fresh or ethanol-fixed specimens of
each species and preserved them in 99.5% ethanol. We
extracted total genomic DNA from the tissue using
QIAamp or DNeasy (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. We amplified the mitogenomes of the
33 lophiiform species in their entirety using a long PCR
technique [42]. We basically used seven fish-versatile
PCR primers for the long PCR in the following four
combinations (for locations of these primers, see

ATG TCC TGA TCC AAC ATC-3’). When we failed to
cover the entire mitogenomes with these primer pairs,
we used an additional five long PCR primers specifically

designed to amplify the lophiiform mitogenomes:
H8319-ANG-Lys (5’-GKA GKC ACC AKT TTT TAG
MTT AAA AGG C-3’); L7567-ANG-Asp (5’-ACG CTG

(5’-AGG TTK GTG ATG ACK GTK GCK CCT CA-3’);
and L14850-ANG-CYB (5’-AAT ATC TCG GTK TGG
TGG AAY TTT GGK TC-3’). Long PCR reaction conditions followed Miya and Nishida [47]. Dilution of the
long PCR products with TE buffer (1:10 to 100 depending on the concentration of the long PCR products)
served as templates for subsequent short PCRs.
We used a standard set of 24 pairs of fish-versatile
primers for short PCRs to amplify contiguous, overlapping segments of the entire mitogenome for each lophiiform species (Table 3). When some of the short PCR
reaction failed, we managed to amplify those regions
with the existing fish-versatile primers. We designed
new species-specific primers when none of the primer
pairs amplified the short segments. Short PCR reaction
conditions followed Miya and Nishida [47]. A list of
PCR primers for each species is available upon request
to MM.
We purified double-stranded short PCR products
using a Pre-Sequencing kit (USB) for direct cycle
sequencing with dye-labeled terminators (Applied Biosystems). We performed all sequencing reactions
according to the manufacture’s instructions with the
same primers as those for the short PCRs. We analyzed
labeled fragments on model 373/377/3100/3130xl
sequencers (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence editing and alignment

We edited each sequence electropherogram with EditView (ver. 1.01; Applied Biosystems) and concatenated
the multiple sequences using AutoAssembler (ver. 2.1;
Applied Biosystems). We carefully checked the concatenated sequences using DNASIS (ver. 3.2; Hitachi Software Engineering) and created a sequence file for each
gene. We compared the sequence files among closely
related species to minimize sequence errors. Genes (or a
portion of genes) that we were unable to sequence
owing to technical difficulties were coded as missing.
To check sensitivity of additional taxon sampling of a
number of the lophiiforms to the results reported in
Yamanoue et al. [27], we used their pre-aligned
sequences as a basis for further alignment with the
newly determined sequences from 33 lophiiforms.
Yamanoue et al. [27] aligned 13 protein-coding, two
rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes using ProAlign ver. 0.5 [48]
and they used only those positions with posterior probabilities ≥70%. An exception to this was the alignment
of tRNA genes, for which Yamanoue et al. [27] modified

the alignment on the basis of the secondary structure,
estimated with DNASIS. They used all the stem regions
even if the aligned sequences were <70% posterior probabilities. Because the aligned sequences of Yamanoue et
al. [27] included several overlapping positions between
the two open reading frames (ATPase 8/6, ND4L/4, and
ND5/6), we excluded those positions from the downstream genes (ATPase 6, ND4, and ND6).
To combine pre-aligned sequences from Yamanoue
et al. [27] with the new sequences, we rearranged the
dataset of Yamanoue et al. [27] into typical gene order
of vertebrates (beginning from tRNA-Phe) and saved it
in a FASTA format. The 33 newly determined
sequences in the same format were concatenated to the
rearranged, pre-aligned sequences and the dataset was
subjected to the multiple alignment using MAFFT ver. 6
[49]. We imported the aligned sequences into MacClade
ver. 4.08 [50] and removed the redundant regions
appeared as gaps with slight modifications by eye to correctly reproduce the aligned sequences used in Yamanoue et al. [27]. All the resulting gap positions from the
alignment were coded as missing.
Phylogenetic analysis

We divided unambiguously aligned sequences into five
partitions (first, second, third codon positions, rRNA
and tRNA genes) assuming that functional constraints
on sequence evolution are more similar within codon
positions (or types of molecules) across genes than
across codon positions (or types of molecules) within
genes. We converted nucleotides at the third codon
positions into purine (A/G) with “R” and pyrimidine (C/
T) with “Y” (RY-coding; Phillips and Penny [51]) to take
only transversions into account in the phylogenetic analysis following the recommendation of Saitoh et al. [52].
This coding effectively removes likely “noise” from the
dataset [53], and avoids the apparent lack of signal by
retaining all available positions in the dataset. The “R”
and “Y” were further recoded with “A” and “C,” respectively, to avoid unnecessary estimation of transitional
changes during the calculations using RAxML with the
exception of an outgroup species (Polymixia japonicus)
for running the program (RAxML does not accept all
“A/C” partitions). We also constructed an additional
two datasets that treat quickly saturated third codon
positions differently (with or without third codon positions) to check sensitivity of the datasets to the phylogenetic analysis. The three datasets are designated as
follows: 1) RY-coding (12 n 3 r RT n ); 2) all positions
included (123 n RT n ); and 3) third codon positions
excluded (12nRTn).
We subjected the above datasets to the partitioned
maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis using RAxML ver.
7.0.4 [41]. A general time reversible model with sites

Page 10 of 27

following a discrete gamma distribution (GTR + Γ; the
model recommended by the author) was used and a
rapid bootstrap (BS) analysis was conducted with 500
replications (-f a option). This option performs BS analysis using GTRCAT, which is GTR approximation with
optimization of individual per-site substitution rates,
and classification of those individual rates into certain
number of rate categories. After implementing the BS
analysis, the program uses every fifth BS tree as a starting point to search for the ML tree using GTR + Γ
model of sequence evolution and saves the top 10 bestscoring ML trees (fast ML searches). Finally RAxML calculates more correct likelihood scores (slow ML
searches) for those 10 trees and puts BS probabilities on
the best-scoring ML tree.
Testing alternative phylogenetic hypotheses

We considered that the best-scoring ML tree resulting
from 12n3rRTn (RY-coding) dataset as the best estimate
of phylogeny because this coding effectively removes
likely “noise” from the dataset and avoids the apparent
lack of signal by retaining all available positions in the
dataset (see discussions in Saitoh et al. [52]). Alternative
tree topologies were thus individually compared to the
resulting best-scoring ML tree derived from the
12n 3 r RT n dataset using the likelihood-based approximately unbiased (AU) test as implemented in CONSEL
[54]. The p-values from this test are calculated using the
multi-scale bootstrap technique and are less biased than
those of the conventional methods such as the bootstrap
probability (BP), the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) test and
the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [55].
We manually created the constrained tree topologies
with reference to the alternative hypotheses using MacClade and then performed the RAxML analysis with
each constraint using the -g option. We conducted the
fast bootstrappings with 100 replicates as described
above and the resulting best-scoring ML tree was considered as the constrained ML tree. The constrained
and unconstrained ML trees (best-scoring ML tree without constraint) were used to compute the per-site log
likelihood scores for each tree using the -f g option in
RAxML and the output was subjected to CONSEL analysis to calculate statistical significance of the differences
in the likelihood scores.
Tracing character evolution

Male sexual parasitism has been found among only the
Ceratioidei [4]. Its evolution was reconstructed on the
best-scoring ML tree derived from 12 n 3 r RT n dataset
under an ML optimality criterion using Mesquite ver.
2.6 [56]. The ML reconstruction methods find the
ancestral states that maximize the probability the
observed states would evolve under a stochastic model

Miya et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/58

of evolution [57,58]. The Mk1 model ("Markov k-state 1
parameter model”), a k-state generalization of the JukesCantor model that corresponds to Lewis’s Mk model
[59], was used to trace the character evolution. Four
character states were assigned to the male sexual parasitism based on extensive observations made by Pietsch
[4] and Pietsch and Orr [33]: males never attach to
females (character state 0); males attach temporarily
(state 1); males are facultative parasites (state 2); and
males are obligate parasites (state 3).
Divergence time estimation

Because lophiiforms are rarely represented in the fossil
record [34-37], the age of divergence of the lophiiform
clades cannot be established precisely based on paleontological data alone. Thus external calibration points
should be used at multiple nodes to estimate the divergence times of the Lophiiformes correctly. To that end,
we used the mitogenomic dataset of Azuma et al. [40]
who extensively sampled actinopterygians from the base
to the top of the tree. Significantly the dataset of Azuma
et al. [40] includes 1) all major lineages of the basal actinopterygians whose fossils and their relative phylogenetic positions are more reliable than those of the
higher teleosts; and 2) all continental cichlids whose
divergences show excellent agreement with the history
of Gondwanian fragmentations.
Mitogenome sequences from the 39 lophiiforms were
concatenated with the pre-aligned sequences used in
Azuma et al. [40] in a FASTA format and the dataset was
subjected to multiple alignment using MAFFT ver. 6 [49]
as described above. The dataset comprises 6966 positions
from first and second codon positions of the 12 proteincoding genes, 1673 positions from the two rRNA genes
and 1407 positions from the 22 tRNA genes (total 10,046
positions). The third codon positions of the protein-coding genes were entirely excluded because of their extremely accelerated rates of changes that may cause a high
level of homoplasy at this taxonomic scale [53] and overestimation of divergence times [60].
Ideally all node ages for the 39 lophiiform species can
be estimated in a single step; however, recent studies
demonstrated that dense taxon sampling in a particular
lineage (as has been done for the Lophiiformes in this
study) tend to lead to overestimation of its age compared to the rest of the tree ("node-density effect”
[61,62]). To avoid such unnecessary overestimation, we
retained a minimum number of taxa from each suborder
in proportion to the logarithms of the species’ diversity
(Table 1). We selected the most distantly related species
from each suborder to estimate crown node ages as correctly as possible. The nine selected species (three species from the most species-rich Ceratioidei and two
from the rest of four suborders) are shown in Table 2

Page 11 of 27

with asterisks. The resulting dataset contains 54 species
used in Azuma et al [40] plus nine lophiiforms, with the
total number of species being 63.
We used a relaxed molecular-clock method for dating
analysis developed by Thorne and Kishino [63] to estimate divergence times. This method accommodates
unlinked rate variation across different loci ("partitions”
in this study), allows the use of time constraints on multiple divergences, and uses a Bayesian MCMC approach
to approximate the posterior distribution of divergence
times and rates based on a single tree topology estimated from the other method (ML tree in this study). A
series of application in the software package multidistribute (v9/25/2003) were used for these analyses.
Baseml in PAML ver. 3.14 was used to estimate model
parameters for each partition separately under the F84 +
Γ model of sequence evolution (the most parameter-rich
model implemented in multidistribute). Based on the
outputs from baseml, branch lengths and the variancecovariance matrix were estimated using estbranches in
multidistribute for each partition. Finally multidivtime
in multidistribute was used to perform Bayesian MCMC
analyses to approximate the posterior distribution of
substitution rates, divergence times, and 95% credible
intervals. In this step, multidivtime uses estimated
branch lengths and the variance-covariance matrices
from all partitions without information from the aligned
sequences.
MCMC approximation with a burnin period of
100,000 cycles was obtained and every 100 cycles was
taken to create a total of 10,000 samples. To diagnose
possible failure of the Markov chains to converge to
their stationary distribution, at least two replicate
MCMC runs were performed with two different random
seeds for each analysis.
Application of multidivtime requires values for the
mean of the prior distribution for the time separating
the ingroup root from the present (rttm) and its standard deviation (rttmsd), and we set conservative estimates of 4.2 (= 420 Myr ago [Ma]) and 4.2 SD,
respectively. The tip-root branch lengths were calculated
using TreeStat v. 1.1 http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/
treestat/ for all terminals and their average was divided
by rttm (4.2) to estimate rate of the root node (rtrate)
and its standard deviation (rtratesd), which were set to
0.074 and 0.074, respectively. The priors for the mean of
the Brownian motion constant, brownmean and
brownsd, were both set to 0.5, specifying a relatively
flexible prior.
The multidivtime program allows for both minimum
(lower) and maximum (upper) time constraints and it
has been argued that multiple calibration points would
provide overall more realistic divergence time estimates.
We therefore sought to obtain an optimal phylogenetic

Miya et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/58

coverage of calibration points across our tree, although
we could set maximum constraints based on fossil
records only for the three basal splits between Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii, Polypteriformes and Actinopteri, Acipenseriformes and Neopterygii (A-C in Table 4).
We also set lower and upper time constraints for three
nodes in cichlid divergence, which show excellent agreement with the Gondwanian fragmentation, assuming
that they have never dispersed across oceans. Accordingly we set a total of 31 time constrains based on both
the fossil record and biogeographic events as shown in
Table 4. The resulting node ages for the Lophiiformes
and its five suborders (posterior means) were used as
the time constraints to estimate divergence times of all
the 39 lophiiform species.
Net diversification rates

We estimated per-clade net diversification rates (r = b d, where b is the speciation rate and d is the extinction
rate) under relative extinction rates (ε = d/b) of 0 and

Page 12 of 27

0.95 using Magallón and Sanderson’s [64] method-ofmoment estimator for each suborder. The equation is
derived from
r = 1 / t(log[n(1 −  ) +  ])

where n is the final number of lineages (present-day
species diversity; Table 1) and t is the time interval considered (stem-group age).

Results and discussion
In the following sections, we describe and discuss the
mitogenomic phylogenies and evolutionary history of
the Lophiiformes. Whole mitogenomic phylogenetic
analysis has been extremely useful in illuminating new
ideas of interrelationships of fishes in particular, and
renewed morphological analysis of these proposed relationships has often provided additional morphological
support to challenge prevailing ideas of evolutionary
relationships [27,65]. We acknowledge, however, a

phylogeny derived from the whole mitogenome only
represents the mtDNA genealogy and may not necessarily match the evolution of the species under analysis.
Because of the lack of recombination, the entire molecule of mtDNA has one molecular history that may be
unusual because of various factors [66]. Incongruence is
a recurring problem at both higher and lower phylogenetic levels [67-70]. As noted by many authors, a broad
approach to illuminating and reconciling this incongruence is to analyze other genetic evidence, such as that
provided by nuclear DNA.
Mitogenome organization

We newly determined the complete (or nearly complete)
L-strand nucleotide sequences for mitogenomes of the 33
lophiiform species during this study and the sequences
have been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the
accession numbers of AB282826-56 and AP005977-8
(Table 2). For Brachionichthys hirsutus (AB282832),
however, we were unable to sequence a region spanning
from tRNA-Gly to the control region (approximately 40%
of the complete sequence) owing to technical difficulties
and degradation of the tissues. The genome contents
include two rRNA, 22 tRNA, and 13 protein-coding
genes, plus the putative control region(s), as found in

Page 13 of 27

other vertebrates, and most of the genes are encoded on
the H-strand, except for the ND6 and eight tRNA genes.
The gene arrangements of the 33 species are identical
to those of typical vertebrates, except for three species
in two different suborders, a tetrabrachiid Tetrabrachium ocellatum (Antennarioidei) and two ceratiids,
Ceratias uranoscopus and Cryptopsaras couesii (Ceratioidei), in which significant numbers of tRNA genes
and the control regions in the latter two taxa are translocated from the typical vertebrate positions. Also,
unlike typical vertebrates, 17 examples of relatively long
non-coding sequences (>100 bp) other than the control
regions occur in 12 ceratioid species in five families
(Caulophrynidae, Melanocetidae, Oneirodidae, Gigantactinidae, Linophrynidae; Table 5). Among these 17 examples, insertion sequences between the ATPase 6 and
COIII genes (118-682 bp; the two genes located adjacent
to each other without insertions in most vertebrates)
were observed in six species in four families (Caulophrynidae, Melanocetidae, Oneirodidae, Linophrynidae),
while 11 other sequences were restricted to either all or
some member(s) of single families (Oneirodidae, Gigantactinidae, Linophrynidae).
Such gene rearrangements and patterns of insertion
sequences have been employed as useful phylogenetic

markers in other fishes, as well as various metazoan animals, because they may represent uniquely derived characters shared by members of monophyletic groups (for
reviews, see [71] but see also [72]). These genomic features also have been demonstrated to be useful in delimiting unexpected monophyletic groups in some
teleosts, such as congroid eels [73] and macrouroid cods
[74]. However, the distributions of these unique genomic features across ceratioid families (not withinfamilies; Table 5) are incongruent with the inferred
inter-familial relationships derived from the nucleotide
sequences (see below), suggesting either independent
acquisitions or a single gain followed by independent
losses of such unique features in a parsimony framework. Details of the gene rearrangements and patterns
of insertion sequences in the Ceratioidei will be discussed elsewhere.
Monophyly and phylogenetic position of the
Lophiiformes

Our taxon sampling assumes the percomorph Lophiiformes (not paracanthopterygian Lophiiformes as advocated by Patterson and Rosen [10]; Rosen and Patterson
[7]) and the datasets comprise 44 whole mitogenome
sequences used in Yamanoue et al. [27] plus those
sequences from the 33 lophiiforms (Table 2). To check
sensitivity of additional taxon sampling from a number
of the lophiiforms to the results reported in Yamanoue
et al. [27], we used their pre-aligned sequences as a
basis for further alignment with the 33 sequences. As
expected from this multiple alignment procedure, the
resulting phylogenies outside the lophiiforms (Figure 5;
derived from 12n 3rRT n dataset) are identical to those
reported in Yamanoue et al. [27] and the order Lophiiformes is confidently recovered as a monophyletic group
with 100% bootstrap probabilities (BPs) in all datasets.
Pietsch and Orr [33] stated that a monophyletic origin
of the Lophiiformes seems certain based on six morphologically complex synapomorphic features [1-3,28] and
this study is the first convincing demonstration of
monophyly of the Lophiiformes based on molecular data
from all the currently-recognized five suborders and
appropriate taxonomic representation from outgroups in
a molecular phylogenetic context.
Concerning the sister-group relationships of the
Lophiiformes, no morphological study has provided a
view that departs significantly from the previous paracanthopterygian notion advocated by Rosen and Patterson [7] and subsequently modified by Patterson and
Rosen [10]. Both mitogenomic [25] and nuclear gene
[23] phylogenies, however, have convincingly demonstrated a percomorph relationship for the Lophiiformes
and nullified the hypothesis of common ancestry with
the Batrachoidiformes. In fact, use of the two whole

Page 14 of 27

mitogenome sequences from the Batrachoidiformes as
only outgroups to root the lophiiform phylogenies disrupted the monophyletic Antennarioidei at the most
basal position (as in Shedlock et al. [29]), followed by
divergence of the Lophioidei, Ogcocephaloidei, and a
clade comprising the Chaunacoidei and Ceratioidei at
the top of the tree (results not shown). These subordinal
relationships, particularly the non-monophyletic and
most basal position of the Antennarioidei, are similar to
those reported by Shedlock et al. [29] who used the
batrachoidiform sequence as an only outgroup to root
their tree.
We therefore excluded those two batrachoidiform
sequences in the present study, thereby revealing a sister-group relationship either with the Caproidei alone
(12n3rRTn and 123nRTn datasets) or with the Caproidei
plus Tetraodontiformes (12nRTn dataset), as shown also
by Yamanoue et al. [27]. Nevertheless all nodal support
values for these relationships were less than 50% bootstrap probabilities (BPs) and addition of unsampled
members of the Percoidei (particularly putative members of Clade H in Kawahara et al. [75]; Yagishita et al.
[76]) may eventually alter this picture of sister-group
relationship of the Lophiiformes. Recently Li et al. [23]
used 10 nuclear genes to analyze higher-level relationships of the actinopterygians and the only included
lophiiform (a lophiid Lophius gastrophysus) was recovered as a sister species of two tetraodontiforms (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis). Although
their dataset did not include a caproid sequence, it does
appear from these and the other studies mentioned
above that the tetraodontiforms are close relatives of the
lophiiforms, within the Percomorpha.
Monophyly and interrelationships of the five suborders

The mitogenomic data strongly support monophyly for
each of the five suborders, the most basal position of
the Lophioidei, and monophyly of a clade comprising
the rest of the four suborders (Ogcocephaloidei, Antennarioidei, Chaunacoidei and Ceratioidei) with 100% BPs
(Figures 5, 6) in all datasets. The recent morphological
study of Pietsch and Orr [33] also recovered monophyly
of the latter clade (and the resulting most basal position
of the Lophioidei) with six unambiguous synapomorphies (their characters 27, 41, 54, 70, 82 and 83). Thus
this pattern of the basal divergence within the Lophiiformes (Figures 5, 6) is supported by two different lines
of evidence and seems to reflect the true phylogeny.
Within a clade comprising the above four suborders, a
sister-group relationship between the Chaunacoidei and
Ceratioidei is consistently recovered in all datasets with
high BPs (90-100%; Figure 6). Phylogenetic positions of
the rest of the two suborders (Ogcocephaloidei and
Antennarioidei), on the other hand, are quite ambiguous

Figure 6 A strict consensus of the three best-scoring maximum likelihood (ML) trees. The strict consensus trees are derived from the
three datasets that treat third codon positions differently (12n3rRTn, 123nRTn, 12nRTn). Lasiognathus sp. was considered as a member of the
Oneirodidae because it is deeply nested within the family and monophyly of the traditional Thaumatichthyidae (Thaumatichthys and
Lasiognathus) is confidently rejected by AU test (diff -ln L = 500.1; P > 0.0000).

and three alternative hypotheses of relationships among
three lineages (Ogcocephaloidei, Antennarioidei, and
Chaunacoidei plus Ceratioidei) are almost equally likely
in a statistical sense (AU test, P = 0.520-0.589; Table 6).
Significantly, when monophyly of the Chaunacoidei plus
Ceratioidei is not constrained in the statistical comparisons, all of the 12 alternative relationships are confidently rejected by AU tests (P = 0.000-0.030; the bottom

12 rows in Table 6), which include the morphologybased hypotheses [3,33](P = 0.002). Therefore the Chaunacoidei is most likely to represent the sister-group of
the Ceratioidei in a mitogenomic context.
We acknowledge, however, that no morphological data
supports a sister-group relationship between the Chaunacoidei and Ceratioidei ([33] but see [32]). Instead, morphological data have indicated monophyly of the

The Antennarioidei contains four families with 53 species
distributed among 17 genera (Table 1). Pietsch and Grobecker [3] presented a cladogram of familial relationships
of the suborder based on seven synapomorphies (Figure
4D), in which the Brachionichthyidae occupies the most
basal position, followed by the divergence of Lophichthyidae, with Tetrabrachiidae and Antennariidae forming a
sister-group at the top of the tree [3]. Although we were
unable to collect tissue samples from the only member of
the Lophichthyidae (Lophichthys boschmai), the mitogenomic tree is completely congruent with the morphology-based phylogeny (Figures 5, 6).
Within the Antennariidae, Antennarius striatus is
recovered as the sister of a terminal clade that includes
Histrio histrio and A. coccineus, thus rendering Antennarius paraphyletic. The Antennariidae is by far the largest family of the suborder, including 45 species in 12
genera, of which only three species and two genera are
included here. While our coverage of the Antennariidae
is poor, an on-going molecular study by one of us
(RJA), based on both mitochondrial and nuclear genes
and considerably more taxa (25 species and 10 genera),
also results in paraphyly for Antennarius. Thus, more
extensive taxon sampling within Antennarius as well as
within other antennariid genera is not likely to alter the
topology shown here.

Morphology-based hypothesis [3]

Ogcocephaloidei plus Ceratioidei with relatively strong
statistical support (BS = 94%; Bremer index = 4; see [33])
with the following three unambiguous synapomorphies: 1)
the first epibranchial is simple and without ligamentous
connection to the second epibranchial (character 43); 2)
the third cephalic dorsal-fin spine and pterygiophore are
absent (character 60); and 3) the posttemporal is fused to
the cranium (character 63). However, all of these characters appear in the Ogcocephaloidei and Ceratioidei to
represent simplified or reductive trends, which are perhaps
more likely to have occurred convergently, and the resulting homoplasy may undermine the robustness of the phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphology [77]. Future
evaluation of homology of these anatomical features,
exploration of new morphological characters, and addition
of molecular data from other genes may help resolve the
conflict between these two different sources of phylogenetic information (for related discussion on the relationships within the Ceratioidei, see below).
Lophiid relationships

The Lophioidei contains a single family, the Lophiidae,
with 25 species distributed among four genera [78]
(Table 1). Caruso [30] presented the first cladogram of
lophiid genera based on 19 morphological characters
(Figure 4C), of which 12 showed derived states shared
by two or three genera. The reconstructed cladogram
indicated the most basal position of Sladenia, followed
by the divergence of Lophiodes and Lophiomus plus

Ogcocephaloid relationships

The Ogcocephaloidei contains a single family with 68
species distributed among 10 genera (Table 1). Endo
and Shinohara [31], while describing a new species of
the genus Coelophrys, cladistically analyzed nine morphological characters (all previously used in [79]) from
nine of the 10 genera. As expected from such a small
number of characters, resolution of the resulting cladogram was poor at the two most basal nodes (Figure 4E)
and Coelophrys - an unusually globose genus among the
typically dorsoventrally flattened ogcocephaloids - was
placed at the top of the tree (Figure 4E). The placement
of Coelophrys and the more basal Halieutaea in the cladogram (Figure 4E) agree with the mitogenomic phylogenies (Figures 5, 6), but the placement of Malthopsis
and Zalieutes do not. A statistical test finds no significant difference between the morphological cladogram
(Figure 4E) and the mitogenomic phylogeny (Figure 5)
(AU test, P = 0.182), perhaps owing to the poor resolution of the morphological cladogram and low taxon
sampling in the molecular phylogenies. Again more

Miya et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/58

extensive taxon sampling will be required to obtain a
better picture of their relationships.
Chaunacoid relationships

The Chaunacoidei contains a single family with about
14 species divided between two genera [2] (Table 1).
While we successfully obtained tissue samples from
three species of the more common Chaunax, those
from the rare genus Chaunacops were unavailable. Thus
we are unable to evaluate monophyly for each of the
two genera and to investigate their relationships. There
is no phylogenetic hypothesis for chaunacoids at
present.
Ceratioid relationships

The Ceratioidei contains 11 families with 160 species
distributed among 35 genera [2] (Table 1). The first
attempt to resolve relationships among ceratioid taxa
after the advent of cladistic method [9] was that of Bertelsen [32]. He admitted, however, that most of the
derived osteological characters shared by two or more
families are reductive states or loss of parts, and similarities among such characters may in many cases represent convergent development. Nevertheless, Bertelsen
[32] presented a cladogram of the ceratioid taxa (Figure
4F), stating that the tree should be regarded only as “a
very schematic compilation of expressed view.” He concluded that future studies on additional characters and
as yet unknown taxa may bring answers to at least some
of the many questions about their phylogenetic
relationships.
More recently, Pietsch and Orr [33], with the advantage of more than 20 years of additional accumulated
data since Bertelsen’s attempt [32], coupled with a reexamination of all previously identified characters and
analyses of new characters, presented the first computer-assisted cladistic analysis of relationships of ceratioid
families and genera (Figure 4G). In that study, Pietsch
and Orr [33] showed two trees: one based on 71 morphological characters applicable to metamorphosed
females (Figure 4G), and another one based on 17 morphological characters applicable to metamorphosed
males and larvae, in addition to the 71 characters
extracted from females, for a total of 88 characters. The
latter tree was poorly resolved and Pietsch and Orr [33]
thus considered the former as the best estimate of
relationships.
Our dataset includes 23 species in 20 genera from all
11 ceratioid families. Our preferred dataset (12n3rRTn:
RY-coding) reproduces the most basal Caulophrynidae,
followed by divergence of the Ceratiidae, Gigantactinidae, Thaumatichthyidae plus Linophrynidae, Neoceratiidae plus Centrophrynidae, Oneirodidae (including
Lasiognathus; see below), Himantolophidae, and

Page 18 of 27

Melanocetidae plus Diceratiidae at the top of the tree in
sequential step-wise manner (Figure 5). More basal relationships among the seven families up to a clade comprising the Neoceratiidae plus Centrophrynidae are
poorly resolved, with all internal branches supported by
<60% BPs. Different treatments of the 3rd codon positions even yield different tree topologies, collapsing the
most basal clade within the Ceratioidei in a strict consensus tree (Figure 6).
Interrelationships among the most apical four families
(Oneirodidae, Himantolophidae, Melanocetidae, and
Diceratiidae), on the other hand, are more robust with
all internal branches supported by 99-100% BPs except
for a sister-group relationship between the Melanocetidae and Diceratiidae (77-97% BPs; Figure 6). Shedlock et
al. [29] also recovered an identical tree topology among
the first three families (Oneirodidae, Himantolophidae,
Melanocetidae) based on short sequences from the
mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, although their dataset
lacked a member of the Diceratiidae. Lasiognathus (Figure 2H), long placed in the Thaumatichthyidae (Figure
2I), is here deeply nested within the Oneirodidae, and
shown as the sister species of the derived oneirodid
Puck pinnata at the top of the clade with 100% BPs
(Figures 5, 6). The placement of Lasiognathus and
Thaumatichthys in separate families was considered by
Bertelsen and Struhsaker [80] who compared the osteology and pointed out that Lasiognathus appears more
closely related to the Oneirodidae, but they chose to
separate the two genera into different families. As
expected from the most derived position of Lasiognathus within the oneirodids with the highest BPs
(100%), monophyly of the traditional Thaumatichthyidae
(including Lasiognathus) is confidently rejected by AU
test (diff -ln L = 500.1; P < 0.0000).
Incongruence between morphology and molecule

As pointed out by Pietsch and Orr [33], who compared
their tree with the unpublished molecular phylogeny
provided by M.M. (referred to as Miya unpubl. data),
the morphological hypothesis (Figure 4G) bears very little resemblance to the mitogenomic phylogenies (Figures 5, 6). Statistical differences between the constrained
and unconstrained ML trees are so large (diff -ln L =
793.9, P < 0.0000 for [32]; diff -ln L = 1308.8, P <
0.0000 for [33]) that we are unable to reconcile these
competing hypotheses. In fact, among the clades that
differ between the two analyses, non-homoplastic morphological characters support only one clade (Himantolophidae, Diceratiidae, and Melanocetidae) and that with
only a single character (8: the condition of the ventromedial extensions of the frontals).
Such remarkable incongruence between morphological
and molecular hypotheses of ceratioid relationships

Miya et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/58

requires an explanation. Although additional sequence
data from other portions of the genome (e.g., nuclear
genes) should be analyzed to confirm molecular conclusions [67,69], Hedges and Sibley [81] argued that, in
such cases of incongruence, morphological evidence
should also be reevaluated. Following Hedges and Sibley’s argument [81] and Bertelsen’s empirical comments
[32] that reductive states or loss of parts and similarities
among such characters may in many cases represent
convergent development, we have reviewed all of the 71
characters from the metamorphosed females and found
the following 18 characters that are reductive, simplified,
or absent for derived states (with the exception of those
characters showing complete congruence with the molecular phylogenies; e.g., only autapomorphies for single
families): vomerine teeth absent (character 3); parietal
absent (9); pterosphenoids absent (10); endopterygoid
absent (16); interopercle extremely reduced (23); rostral
cartilage absent (26); maxillae considerably reduced (29);
thick anterior maxillomandibular ligament very much
reduced or absent (30); dentaries simple (31); first pharyngobranchial absent (39); first epibranchial absent (42);
first epibranchial simple, not bearing a medial process
(43); third hypobranchial absent (45); branchial teeth
absent on the first three ceratobranchial (46); ninth or
lower-most ray in caudal fin reduced (52); cephalic
dorsa-fin spine absent (60); posttemporal is fused to the
cranium (63); and pelvic bones reduced (66).
Assuming that all or some of these 18 reductive or
simplified morphological characters likely represent
homoplasy, we excluded them from the original dataset
and the reduced dataset was subjected to maximum parsimony (MP) analysis, similar to that conducted by
Pietsch and Orr [33]. The MP analysis produced 11
equally most parsimonious trees, with a total length of
100, a consistency index of 0.610, and a retention index
of 0.835, a strict consensus shown in Figure 4. The
resulting MP tree exhibits some important similarities
with the molecular phylogenies that are not evident in
the trees of Pietsch and Orr [33]. For example, the Caulophrynidae is placed as the most basal lineage within
the Ceratioidei in the revised cladogram (Figure 7).
Pietsch and Orr [33] were surprised with the derived
position of the Caulophrynidae in their cladogram (Figure 4G) in light of Bertelsen’s view [32,82] that the
absence of an escal light organ in all life-history stages
of the family is not due to secondary loss. Bertelsen’s
opinion [32,82] was reinforced by ontogenetic information from other characters, such as the apparent absence
of sexual dimorphism in rudiments of the illicium and
the absence of a distal swelling of the illicial rudiments.
Our preferred mitochondrial dataset (12n3rRTn: RY-coding) supports the most basal position of Caulophrynidae
within the Ceratioidei (and monophyly of the rest of the

Page 19 of 27

families to the exclusion of the Caulophrynidae),
although statistical support is not convincing (53% BP
in Figure 5).
The revised cladogram (Figure 7) also recovers a
monophyletic group comprising the Himantolophidae,
Melanocetidae and Diceratiidae that is supported by
100% BPs (Figures 5, 6). Pietsch and Orr [33] observed
that these three families uniquely share a single nonhomoplastic morphological character (ventromedial
extensions of the frontal that make no contact with the
parasphenoid). In addition to these ceratioid relationships, monophyly of the Ogcocephaloidei + Ceratioidei
is collapsed to form a trichotomy of these two suborders
plus Chaunacoidei. Thus simple exclusion of reduced or
simplified characters from the morphological dataset
yields a tree that can be better reconciled with the molecular phylogenies (Figures 5, 6). However, simply deleting all reductive characters may also be misleading, by
running the risk of rejecting informative characters.
Homology of reductive morphological characters is
commonly evaluated by ontogenetic analysis, but in the
case of ceratioids, very little ontogenetic material is
available for analysis [2,33]. Considerably more work
will be needed to further reconcile these competing phylogenetic hypotheses.
Evolution of male sexual parasitism

The maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction of the
four reproductive modes in ceratioid males on the mitogenomic phylogenies reveals that character states at the
two ancestral, most basal nodes (A and B in Figure 8),
are equivocal. The character states 0 (males never attach
to females) and 2 (males are facultative parasites) are
almost equally likely at node A (P0 = 0.356; P2 = 0.381),
as are the character states 1 (males attach temporarily)
and 3 (males are obligate parasites) at node B (P 1 =
0.348; P 3 = 0.390). Thus we are unable to determine
ancestral states of facultative and obligate parasitic
males in the Caulophrynidae (node A) and Ceratiidae
(node B), respectively (Figure 8). With the exception of
these two basal families, evolutionary origins of parasitic
males are unequivocally reconstructed on the mitogenomic phylogenies in more derived clades above node C
(Figure 8). For example, precursors of those taxa with
obligate (Linophrynidae and Neoceratiidae) and facultative (the oneirodid Bertella) parasitic males are reconstructed as the temporal attachment of males at nodes
D, E, and F with high probabilities (P 1 = 0.893-0.995;
Figure 8). On the basis of their morphological cladogram, Pietsch and Orr [33] stated that whether facultative parasitism and temporary attachment of males to
females are precursors to obligate parasitism, or the former are more derived states of the latter, remains
unknown. Our ML reconstruction strongly suggests that

Figure 7 A strict consensus of the 11 most parsimonious tree derived from maximum parsimony (MP) analysis of 53 morphological
characters. These morphological characters are applicable to the metamorphosed females only (71 characters used in Pietsch and Orr [33]
minus 18 characters that are supposedly show reductive or simplified states; for details see text). The 11 MP trees had a total length of 100, a
consistency index of 0.610, and a retention index of 0.835.

temporary attachment of males to females is a precursor
to facultative or obligate parasitism for at least three of
the five cases at the family level (Figure 8).
Pietsch and Orr [33] further argued that the disjunct
pattern of sexual parasitism within ceratioids appears
to be the result of independent acquisition among the
various lineages rather than a repeated loss of this
attribute within the suborder. To support this argument, Pietsch and Orr [33] listed many differences in
the precise nature of male-female attachment among

the various taxa [4], to the extent of the most extreme
possibility being an independent acquisition of sexual
parasitism within families, such as the Ceratiidae
(Ceratias vs. Cryptopsaras) and Linophrynidae (Haplophryne vs. Linophryne). If so, evolution of sexual parasitism has independently occurred as many as seven
times within the suborder (= the number of green or
blue circles at terminal nodes in Figure 8). Similarly,
although our simple character coding does not take
into account such differences in male-female

attachment, our ML reconstruction suggests that
acquisition of this attribute has occurred at least five
times during ceratioid evolution. Shedlock et al. [29]
also found a paraphyletic pattern of sexual parasitism
within the suborder in their much smaller dataset and
suggested that the plasticity of this unique life history
trait among vertebrates is likely shaped by a dynamic
relationship between localized population densities and
the feasibility of maintaining mate choice at low effective population size in the expanse of the deep ocean.
Of course, it may be possible that availability of more
specimens from these rare organisms will shed a new
light for evolution of the male sexual parasitism.

Divergence time estimation

As Carnevale and Pietsch [34] stated, fishes of the order
Lophiiformes are very rare in the fossil record and all of
the recorded ages fall in the Cenozoic from 7.6 to 40
Myr ago (for details, see Table 4). Assuming a sister
group relationship of the Lophiiformes and Tetraodontiformes, however, the origin of the modern Lophiiformes
can be dated to the deep Mesozoic, because an articulated fossil that is convincingly assignable to the modern
Tetraodontiformes was discovered from the mid Cretaceous (Cenomanian) 98 Myr ago [83]. This fossil lineage
would have appeared well after the divergence of
the common ancestor of the Lophiiformes and

Miya et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/58

Tetraodontiformes. Fossils are useful only for minimum
time constraints to estimate divergence times of the
Lophiiformes, as generally acknowledged [40,84].
A relaxed molecular-clock Bayesian analysis of divergence time estimates in the present study (Figure 9),
which is based on 31 time constraints (Table 4), shows
excellent agreement with previous studies based on
whole mitogenome sequences (Table 7). Therefore, the

Page 22 of 27

analysis is not sensitive to the taxon sampling strategy
employed to avoid a “node density effect” (i.e., sampling
a minimum number of lophiiform species[61,62]). The
Lophiiformes is estimated to have diverged from an
ancestral lineage of the Tetraodontiformes (the putative
sister-group in the present dataset) 157 Myr ago (145172 Myr ago; 95% credible interval) (Figure 9). Although
a common ancestral lineage of the Lophiiformes has

failed to leave extant lineages for about 23 Myr, it has
subsequently diversified into five subordinal lineages in
a relatively short time interval of 18 Myr between 117
and 135 Myr ago: a common ancestor of the order is
estimated to have diverged into the Lophioidei and the
rest of the four suborders 135 Myr ago (121-149 Myr
ago), followed by the divergence into the Ogcocephaloidei and the rest of the three suborders 129 Myr ago
(115-144 Myr ago), the Antennarioidei and the rest of
the two suborders 125 Myr ago (112-140 Myr ago), and
the Chaunacoidei and Ceratioidei 117 Myr ago (104-131
Myr ago). Significantly, ancestral lineages of the modern
Lophiiformes have occupied various marine habitats,
from relatively shallow benthic to (principally) deep
bathypelagic (>1000 m deep) environments, within this
short time period (18 Myr). This time period roughly
corresponds to the beginning of the Gondwanian fragmentation [85,86] which, with these vicariant events,
produced diversified coastal marine environments, with
various niches along the continental shelves.
Unique among principally bathypelagic ceratioids are
three species of the genus Thaumatichthys (Thaumatichthyidae; Figure 2I) that are abyssal-benthic, presumably staying in deep-sea bottom (> 1000 m) and luring
prey items with esca “inside the mouth” [80]. If this
unusual life style had been attained concurrently in the
origin of the common ancestor of Thaumatichthys, it
took about 33 Myr after leaving the bottom of the sea
around the continental shelves and subsequently returning to that unique benthic life style at greater depths.
Patterns and rates of diversification

The resulting time tree of the Lophiiformes (Figure 10)
allows us to provide some insights into the patterns and
rates of diversification across the order. Although
incomplete taxon sampling from some of the suborders
(Ogcocephaloidei, Antennarioidei, Chaunacoidei) prohibited rigorous evaluation of the patterns of diversification across the Lophiiformes, there are remarkable

differences between diversification patterns in the
Lophioidei (= Lophiidae) and Ceratioidei, for which we
successfully sampled all of the genera and families
(Figure 10). An ancestral lineage of the Lophioidei
began to diversify 109 Myr ago, leaving only four modern genera during a period of about 27 Myr. Almost
concurrently, an ancestral lineage of the Ceratioidei
began to diversify 103 Myr ago, leaving as many as eight
modern families plus a common ancestor of the three
more derived families (Himantolophidae, Melanocetidae,
Diceratiidae) during a period of about 20 Myr, suggesting rapid morphological radiations during an early phase
of ceratioid evolution at bathypelagic depths. Such rapid
familial radiations and the resulting short internal
branches may render the phylogenetic analysis difficult
to resolve the basal relationships (Figure 6).
Per-clade net diversification rates based on stem-node
ages and current species diversity, on the other hand,
can be compared across all subordinal lineages. Accordingly we estimated net diversification rates (b - d, where
b is the speciation rate and d is the extinction rate) per
clade, under the lowest extinction rate (d:b = 0) and
under an extremely high relative extinction rate (d:b =
0.95) for each clade (Table 8). With a known diversity
of 361 modern species (Table 1) and an estimated basal
split at 157 Myr ago (Figure 9), the Lophiiformes exhibit
an average net diversification rate of 0.0368 event per
lineage per million years under d:b = 0 and 0.0181 event
per lineage per million years under d:b = 0.95. As
expected from differences in the current diversity and
similar stem node ages, the Ceratioidei exhibits remarkably higher net diversification rates of 0.0434 event per
lineage per million years under d:b = 0 and 0.0188 event
per lineage per million years under d:b = 0.95 (Table 8)
than those of the rest of the four suborders (0.02310.0334 under d:b = 0; 0.0045-0.0115 under d:b = 0.95).
With the acquisition of novel features, such as male
dwarfism, bioluminescent lures, and unique reproductive
modes, it appears that a ceratioid invasion of a largely

Conclusions
The mitogenomic analyses demonstrated previously
unappreciated phylogenetic relationships among the
lophiiform suborders and deep-sea ceratioid familes.
Although the latter relationships cannot be reconciled
with the earlier hypotheses based on morphology, we
found that simple exclusion of the reductive or simplified characters can alleviate some of the conflict. Reconstruction of the male reproductive modes of the

Miya et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/58

ceratioids on the resultant phylogeny revealed complex
evolutionary patterns of the sexual parasitism in males.
A relaxed molecular-clock Bayesian analysis of the
divergence times suggests that all of the subordinal
diversifications have occurred during a relatively short
time period between 100 and 130 Myr ago (early to mid
Cretaceous). Comparisons of per-clade net diversification rates among the five lophiiform suborders suggest
that the acquisition of novel features, such as male
dwarfism, bioluminescent lures, and unique reproductive
modes allowed the deep-sea ceratioids to diversify
rapidly in a largely unexploited, food-poor bathypelagic
zone (200-2000 m depth) relative to the other lophiiforms occurring in shallow coastal areas along continental shelves.
