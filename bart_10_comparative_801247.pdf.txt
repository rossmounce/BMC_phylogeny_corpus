Abstract
Background: Despite vaccination since the 1950s, pertussis has persisted and resurged. It remains a major cause of
infant death worldwide and is the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in developed countries. The
resurgence of pertussis has been associated with the expansion of Bordetella pertussis strains with a novel allele for
the pertussis toxin (Ptx) promoter, ptxP3, which have replaced resident ptxP1 strains. Compared to ptxP1 strains,
ptxP3 produce more Ptx resulting in increased virulence and immune suppression. To elucidate how B. pertussis has
adapted to vaccination, we compared genome sequences of two ptxP3 strains with four strains isolated before and
after the introduction vaccination.
Results: The distribution of SNPs in regions involved in transcription and translation suggested that changes in
gene regulation play an important role in adaptation. No evidence was found for acquisition of novel genes.
Modern strains differed significantly from prevaccination strains, both phylogenetically and with respect to
particular alleles. The ptxP3 strains were found to have diverged recently from modern ptxP1 strains. Differences
between ptxP3 and modern ptxP1 strains included SNPs in a number of pathogenicity-associated genes. Further,
both gene inactivation and reactivation was observed in ptxP3 strains relative to modern ptxP1 strains.
Conclusions: Our work suggests that B. pertussis adapted by successive accumulation of SNPs and by gene (in)
activation. In particular changes in gene regulation may have played a role in adaptation.

Background
The genus Bordetella comprises nine species, of which
four are exclusively respiratory pathogens of mammalian
hosts: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella holmesii [1]. The
first three species are closely related, while B. holmesii
forms a distinct branch [2]. B. bronchiseptica causes
chronic and often asymptomatic respiratory tract infections in a wide variety of mammals and is only sporadically isolated from humans. B. parapertussis consists of
two distinct lineages, designated B. parapertussisHU and
B. parapertussis OV , which infect humans and sheep
respectively [3,4]. B. parapertussisHU and B. pertussis are
exclusive human pathogens and the causative agents of
pertussis or whooping cough. Both these species have
evolved independently from a B. bronchiseptica-like

ancestor, a process which has been accompanied by
extensive gene loss [4-6].
By far, most cases of whooping cough are caused by
B. pertussis. Despite widespread vaccination, pertussis
remains a major cause of infant death worldwide [7]. In
the 1990s a resurgence of pertussis was observed in several countries with highly vaccinated populations and
pertussis has become the most prevalent vaccinepreventable disease in developed countries [8-10]. In the
Netherlands, the estimated rate of infection was 6.6% per
year for the 3-79-year age group from 1995 through 1996
[11]. Similar percentages have been found in the United
States [12-14]. One of the hallmarks of the pertussis
resurgence is a shift in disease prevalence towards older
persons who have waning vaccine-induced immunity,
while recently vaccinated infants are well protected [15].
The reemergence of pertussis has been attributed to various factors including decreased vaccination coverage
due to concerns over side effects, suboptimal vaccines,
waning vaccine-induced immunity, and adaptation of

B. pertussis [1,9,10]. The relative contribution of these
factors may differ between countries and is the subject of
ongoing debate. Pathogen adaptation is supported by several observations. We and others have shown that antigenic divergence has occurred between vaccine strains
and clinical isolates with respect to surface proteins
which confer protective immunity; pertussis toxin (Ptx),
pertactin and fimbriae [1,16-18]. Further, in a mouse
model, pertussis vaccines were less effective against
strains carrying non-vaccine type antigens compared to
strains with vaccine-type antigens [19-22]. Recently we
found evidence that polymorphism in the promoter for
Ptx (ptxP) may also be important in adaptation [23]. In
the last twenty years two ptxP alleles, ptxP1 and ptxP3,
predominated in the Dutch B. pertussis population. The
ptxP3 strains were first observed in 1988, gradually
increased in frequency, and nearly completely replaced
the resident ptxP1 strains in the late 1990s. In the Netherlands, the increase in frequency of ptxP3 strains was
associated with the resurgence of pertussis. The ptxP3
strains are found in Asia, Europe, North and South
America, and there is evidence that they have spread
worldwide in the 1980s and 1990s [23]. The ptxP3 strains
produced more Ptx than the ptxP1 strain and epidemiological data suggest that ptxP3 strains are more virulent.
Ptx suppresses both the innate and adaptive immune system [24,25] and we have proposed that increased Ptx
production increases pathogen fitness in vaccinated
populations by enhancing transmission by hosts in which
vaccine immunity has waned. Thus, both antigenic divergence and increased immune suppression in combination
with waning immunity are likely to contribute to the pertussis resurgence [23]. Here we extend our studies on
adaptation of B. pertussis using comparative genomics.
We determined, annotated and compared genome
sequences of six Dutch strains, two of which were isolated before vaccination was introduced in 1953 and four
modern strains, isolated approximately 50 years later.
The modern strains carried either the ptxP1 allele or the
ptxP3 allele, while the pre-vaccination strains carried
ptxP1 or ptxP2. We identified novel polymorphisms in
specific genes and gene categories which may play a role
in the persistence and resurgence of pertussis in the face
of intensive vaccination.

Results and Discussion
Strain selection

Our long term aim is to identify B. pertussis loci which
have contributed to the persistence and resurgence of
pertussis in vaccinated populations. We selected two
strains isolated in 1949 and 1952 which were characteristic for the Dutch B. pertussis population in the prevaccine era [16,26], and four modern strains isolated in

Page 2 of 10

1999 and 2000, approximately 50 years after the introduction of vaccination. Two of the modern strains carried the ptxP1 allele and two the ptxP3 allele. In our
comparisons, we included the Tohama I strain (ptxP1)
of which the annotated genome sequence was available
[6]. The Tohama I strain was isolated in Japan in the
1950s and has been subcultured in vitro extensively. It
is used as model strain in many different laboratories.
Strain characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Comparative analysis of Bordetella pertussis genomes

We determined the genome sequences of the six B. pertussis strains through pyrosequencing. As this technology is known to generate errors in homopolymeric
nucleotide tracts, SNPs and indels in these regions were
filtered out. As a consequence, differences between
strains in homopolymeric nucleotide tracts were not
identified. However, homopolymeric nucleotide tracts
have high mutation rates and may vary during subculturing of a single strain [27]. Thus, genotypes and phenotypes controlled by homopolymeric nucleotide tracts
are not stable and changes in these tracts will not represent fixed differences between strains.
We identified 471 SNPs (i.e. bases that were not conserved in one or more of the seven strains), of which
414 and 57 were located in ORFs and intergenic regions,
respectively (Additional file 1). Four ORFs were found to
contain small insertion or deletions (indels) ranging
from eight to 31 bases (Additional file 1). Based on our
analyses, the estimated SNP density was 1 SNP per
8,675 bases. Maharjan and coworkers used Microarraybased comparative genome sequencing to detect SNPs
in 34% of the Tohama I genome [28]. The Tohama I
strain was compared to an Australian isolate from 2006
and a SNP density of 1 SNP per 20,000 bases was
found. As we included the whole genome in our comparison and used a larger number of strains, the higher
SNP density we found was not unexpected. SNP densities in other monomorphic human pathogens have been
found to range from 1 SNP per 2,300 bases in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi [29] to 1 SNP per 28,400
bases in Mycobacterium leprae [30,28]. This places
B. pertussis among the most monomorphic human
pathogens known. In their analyses, Maharjan and coworkers identified 66 SNPs in 1,229 genes and 4 SNPs in
268 intergenic regions. Of these 70 SNPs, 27 (39%) were
also detected in one of the six Dutch strains, while 14
(20%) were specific for the Australian strain.
In addition to the SNPs discussed above, we confirmed 13 large regions of difference (RDs) identified in
previous studies using microarrays [31-35] and whole
genome sequencing [33,36]. Further, we found a new
polymorphism in RD23 (Additional files 2 and 3).

Year of isolation and alleles of main virulence factors are shown. Coverage refers to oversampling in sequence data. Genome size was based on size of the
Tohama I genome corrected for the large regions of differences. Abbreviations: Mb, megabases; NA not available.

Genetic relationship based on whole genome sequencing

A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 471
SNPs was derived (Figure 1). The genome sequence of B.
bronchiseptica was used as outgroup to root the tree [6].
The tree suggested that B1193, which harbors the ptxP2
allele, represented a distinct lineage which diverged from
the six other strains relatively early in the history of B. pertussis. Although the Tohama I strain was more closely
related to the four remaining Dutch strains, it also formed
a distinct, relatively deep branch. This may be due to the
fact that the Tohama I strain has been subcultured in vitro
since the 1950s resulting in a relaxation of selective forces,
or it could reflect geographical isolation, as the Tohama I
strains was isolated in Japan, while all other strains were
from the Netherlands. The four recently isolated Dutch
strains were closely related. The tree indicated that the
ptxP3 strains comprise a monophyletic lineage which
recently diverged from modern ptxP1 strains.
Evidence for selection in cis regulatory regions

Although it is often assumed that mutations located
outside protein coding sequences (CDSs) are neutral,

such mutations can affect fitness if they are located in
cis-regulatory elements (i.e. in regions involved in binding of transcriptional factors or in regions that affect
translation). To explore the role of cis regulatory elements in adaptation, we determined the distribution of
all SNPs in intergenic regions relative to the start codon
of predicted CDSs in segments of 25 bases (Figure 2).
Assuming random mutation (the null hypothesis), one
expects a SNP distribution which reflects the frequency
of the 25 base intergenic segments in the chromosome.
This frequency is highest for the proximate 25 base segment and decreases with distance to the start codon
(Figure 2). The actual frequency distribution was compared with the frequency based on null hypothesis and
found to be significantly different (P 0.01). In view of
the low number of SNPs observed, the region 200 to >
500 will be ignored. In the regions 50-99 and 175-199
more SNPs were observed than in the random mutation
model, suggesting diversifying selection. These regions
may contain binding sites for regulatory proteins such
as BvgA, as shown for Ptx [37]. The regions 125-174
and 0-24 contained less SNPs compared to the random

model, possibly reflecting purifying selection. The region
0-24 contains the binding site for RNA-polymerase and
regions involved in initiation of translation and it seems
that such regions tend to be conserved in B. pertussis.
Thus our results provide evidence that regions involved
in binding of regulatory proteins are subject to diversifying selection suggesting a role in adaptation. The low
degree of polymorphism, the limited number of strains
sequenced and the absence of silent mutations in some
CDSs did not allow calculation of dN/dS ratios to identify purifying or diversifying selection in ORFs [38-40].
Polymorphisms in pathogenicity-associated genes

The 89 pathogenicity-associated genes (Additional file 4)
contained 34 polymorphisms (SNPs and small indels)
distributed over 24 genes and three promoter regions
(Figure 3 and Additional file 5). To the best of our
knowledge, 16 of the polymorphisms in pathogenicityassociated genes were not described before. Nineteen of
the 34 polymorphisms were specific for the ptxP2 strain,
again underlining the distinct nature of this strain. It
was noteworthy that for Ptx, Prn (unpublished data), the

type III secretion toxin (BteA) and tracheal colonization
factor (TcfA), polymorphisms were found in both the
protein coding sequences [41,42] and the (putative) promoter regions, suggesting both structural and regulatory
adaptations for these virulence factors.
Polymorphisms which distinguish strains isolated before
and after the introduction of vaccination

The comparison of polymorphisms which distinguish
strains isolated before and after the introduction of vaccination (for convenience designated as pre- and poststrains) may be useful to identify mutations which
increase fitness in vaccinated populations and hence
reduce vaccine efficacy. We identified 14 non-silent, 11
silent SNPs, three intergenic SNPs, one nonsense mutation and two indels which distinguished pre- and poststrains (pseudo-genes were excluded). The distribution
of alleles and SNPs are shown in Additional file 6 and
Figure 4, respectively. Here, only polymorphisms
believed to be particularly interesting based on our current knowledge are discussed. The post-strains were distinguished by a large deletion (RD3) comprising

24 CDSs. King et al. [34] analyzed a larger number of
post-strains (N = 43), all of which were found to miss
RD3. RD3 contains four ORFs coding for putative
exported proteins and its removal may reduce the antigenic profile of B. pertussis. Alternatively, the deletion of

this region may be unrelated to vaccination and reflect
the ongoing genome reduction [32,35]. One gene, pitA
coding for a putative phosphate transporter, was inactivated in post-strains by a nonsense mutation. The nonsense mutation was also observed in an Australian

strain [28]. Post-strain-specific, non-silent, polymorphisms were found in two genes for exported virulence
factors, prn and ptxA, in agreement with previous studies [18]. There is evidence that polymorphism in these
two genes affects vaccine efficacy in a mouse model
[19-22]. The locus for another (putative) exported protein (BP2028) also contained a non-silent polymorphism
specific for post-strains. Blast searches revealed 100%
identity at the amino acid level between the prevaccination variant and homologues found in B. bronchiseptica
and B. parapertussis, suggesting that the prevaccination
strains harbor the ancestral allele. No significant similarity was found with CDSs from other bacteria, suggesting
a highly specific function. Although the function of the
protein is not known, the fact that it is exported suggests a role in host-pathogen interaction. Also of interest is a SNP in the promoter region for the type III
secretion toxin and chaperone genes, bteA and btcA
respectively. For B. bronchiseptica it has been shown
that BteA is translocated into the host and is necessary
and sufficient for rapid cytotoxicity in a wide range of
mammalian cells [43,44]. The SNP, which involves an
A/G transition, is located in a putative TATA box of
btcA and therefore could influence its expression. We
investigated the temporal trends of the two alleles,
designated allele A and allele G (Figure 5). Allele A was
found in all strains from 1949 to 1970 (N = 12). Allele
G was first observed in 1977 and gradually increased in
frequency to ~90% in 2000-2008. The allele A was
found in B. bronchiseptica suggesting that it is the
ancestral type, consistent with the trend observed in the
Netherlands.

Polymorphisms which distinguish ptxP3 strains

Strains carrying the ptxP3 allele have spread worldwide
and have contributed to the pertussis epidemic in The
Netherlands [23]. It seems likely that the ptxP3 allele
confers increased fitness compared to the ptxP1 allele it
replaced in current human populations. Alternatively, it
may be a marker for other selective changes in the same
haplotype. To identify other genes that may have contributed to the increased fitness of the ptxP3 lineage, we
sought polymorphisms which were unique for the ptxP3
lineage. We identified 26 polymorphisms specific for
one or both ptxP3 strains, 11 non-silent SNPs, eight
silent SNPs, four intergenic SNPs, two small indels
(eight and 31 bases) and one large deletion (RD10, comprising 2.2 kbases). The distribution of alleles and polymorphisms are shown in Additional file 7 and Figure 6,
respectively. Only polymorphisms we believe to be particularly interesting based on our current knowledge are
discussed. The association of the RD10 deletion with
ptxP3 strains was noted before using a larger collection
of strains (N = 15) [34]. One of the intergenic SNPs was
located in the ptx promoter and defines the ptxP3 lineage. The remaining three intergenic SNPs were located
proximal to the genes for glycyl tRNA synthetase alpha
chain gene (glyQ), a transporter, an integral membrane
transport protein and a dihydrodipicolinate synthetase.
It is not clear whether these SNPs affect transcription.
We have shown previously that the SNP in the Ptx promoter region affects production of Ptx, however [23].
Two ptxP3-specific SNPs were in known virulence
genes, fim3 and bscI, coding for the serotype 3 fimbriae
and a component of the type III secretion system,

an A/G transition and was located between the type III secretion toxin gene bteA and its chaperone btcA. The two genes are oriented back to
back. The period 1949-2008 was investigated using 44 strains.

respectively [43,45]. Two indels, located in BP0880 and
BP2946, were ptxP3-specific. BP0880 codes for a putative exported protein which shows similarity with metal
dependent phosphohydrolases and signal transduction
proteins, while the BP2496 product belongs to the
family of arsS transcriptional regulators. BP0880 was a
pseudogene in all strains, except the two ptxP3 strains
in which the reading frame was restored by deletion of
an eight base repeat. Conversely, the reading frame of
arsS was intact in all strains except the two ptxP3
strains, due to the deletion of a 31 base repeat. Both
BP0880 and BP2496 are intact in B. bronchiseptica and
B. parapertussis. The BP0880 and BP2496 genes from
three ptxP3 strains were sequenced completely and the
ORFs were found to be intact and truncated, respectively. It seems likely that BP0880 and BP2946 are subject to phase variation, i.e. the reversible on/off
switching of genes by varying DNA sequence repeat
units [46]. Phase variation has been observed for a number of other B. pertussis genes [27,45,47]. Based on the
phylogenetic relationships, it seems likely that BP0880
and BP2949 were, respectively, reactivated and inactivated in the ptxP3 lineage. This qualifies these loci for
further analyses as to their role in the emergence of
ptxP3 strains.

Conclusions
We provide the first comprehensive genomic comparison of a bacterial pathogen circulating in a highly vaccinated population. In this study, we included two strains
from the prevaccination era and four strains isolated
~50 years later. We confirmed and extended the observation that modern B. pertussis strains differed significantly from prevaccination strains, both phylogenetically
and with respect to particular alleles [1]. Further, we
identified one highly divergent, possibly ancient, B. pertussis lineage, characterized by the ptxP2 allele. Our
work confirmed that B. pertussis strains differ significantly in gene content due to gene loss, a process which
may still be ongoing [32,35]. Further, we found no evidence that acquisition of novel genes has played a role
in adaptation, as has been suggested for B. holmesii [2].
In contrast, B. pertussis seems to adapt mainly by the
successive accumulation of SNPs. Our work shows that,
based on SNP density, B. pertussis is one of the most
monomorphic human pathogens. This suggests a recent
origin of this species or, more likely, a recent population
bottle neck [1,4].
Our results provide evidence that regions involved in
binding of regulatory proteins are subject to diversifying
selection suggesting a role in adaptation. Indeed, this is

Bart et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:627
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/627

exemplified by the rapid emergence of ptxP3 strains with
increased pertussis toxin production [23]. A number of
recent studies have highlighted the importance of changes
in gene regulation in adaptation of pathogens [48-51]. It is
noteworthy that for a number of virulence factors (Ptx,
Prn and TcfA), SNPs were found in both the proteinencoding genes and the (putative) promoter regions, suggesting adaptation at both the structural and regulatory
level for the same phenotype. Of interest is a SNP in the
promoter region for the type III secretion toxin (BteA)
and chaperone genes (BtcA). For B. bronchiseptica it has
been shown that BteA is necessary and sufficient for rapid
cytotoxicity in a wide range of mammalian cells [43,44].
The ancestral allele was found in all strains from before
1977, but subsequently replaced by a novel allele which
increased in frequency to ~90% in 2000-2008. This suggests that the novel allele may significantly affect strain fitness, although it is also possible that its increase in
frequency is due to hitchhiking with other loci which
affect fitness. In any case, this allele may be an important
marker for successful lineages. The ptxP3 lineage, associated with the resurgence of pertussis in the Netherlands,
has emerged recently and spread worldwide [23]. We
found that the ptxP3 strains comprised a young branch
which diverged recently from modern ptxP1 strains.
Several alleles were identified, which were uniquely associated with the ptxP3 lineage and may thus have contributed to its success. Two ptxP3-specific SNPs were in
known virulence genes, fim3 and bscI, coding for the serotype 3 fimbriae and a component of the type III toxin
secretion system, respectively. We also observed both
reactivation and inactivation of genes in the ptxP3 lineage.
In conclusion, this work has identified a number of genetic
loci which are associated with highly successful strains.
Further analyses of these loci can contribute to our understanding of the evolution of bacterial pathogens.

Methods
Strain, culture conditions and DNA isolation

The six clinical isolates used in this study are described
in Table 1. Strains were grown on Bordet Gengou (BG)
agar supplemented with 15% sheep blood and incubated
for 3 days at 35Â°C. DNA was isolated using QIAGEN
Genomic-tip 100/G kit, according to the manufacturerâs
instructions.
Genome sequencing and detection of polymorphisms

B1831 was sequenced using the 454 GS-G20 sequencer
(Roche) and the other five isolates were sequenced using
the 454 GS-FLX sequencer (Roche), according to the
manufacturerâs instructions. The generated reads were
assembled de novo into contigs using the Newbler
assembler (Roche).

Page 8 of 10

SNPs, insertions and deletions were detected by mapping the contigs to the previously sequenced and annotated B. pertussis Tohama I genome [6] using BLAST.
We filtered SNP calls as described in [29]. Briefly, SNPs
with low base quality, SNPs within 15 base of the end of
a contig, SNPs in repetitive sequences, such as insertion
sequence elements, and SNPs in homopolymeric tracts
were removed. Single base insertions or deletions in
homopolymeric tracts were ignored as these are often a
result of 454 sequencing errors [52]. To determine the
accuracy of these SNPs we verified 88 SNPs in the
sequenced strains by combining PCR with mass spectrometry (Sequenom). All 88 SNPs were correct. Only for a
subset of small indels (â¥ 6 b), which distinguished sets
of strains, were checked by resequencing and included
in the analyses. Genome sequences have been submitted
to the NCBI Nucleotide Sequence data base (accessions
numbers; strain B0558, ADKR00000000; strain B1193,
ADKS00000000; strain B1831, ADKT00000000; strain
B1834, ADKU00000000; strain B1917, ADKV00000000;
strain B1920, ADKW00000000).
Phylogenetic analysis

Only SNPs for which the allele at the orthologous
nucleotide was determined in all strains were included
in the phylogenetic analysis. A Maximum Likelihood
tree was derived using PhyML [53] with the following
parameters: model, HKY; transition/transversion ratio;
estimated; proportion of invariable sites, estimated;
number of relative substitution rate categories, 4;
gamma distribution parameter, estimated; starting tree,
BIONJ; optimize tree topology, yes; optimize branch
lengths and rate parameters, yes.
Statistical analyses

To determine if there is evidence for selection in cisregulatory loci, we compared the expected distribution
of the distance of SNPs to the start of the gene with the
actual distribution of these distances using the Chi
square test. This was done for all genes.
