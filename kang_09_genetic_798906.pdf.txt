Abstract
Recent identification of a newfound hantavirus, designated Seewis virus (SWSV), in the Eurasian
common shrew (Sorex araneus), captured in Switzerland, corroborates decades-old reports of
hantaviral antigens in this shrew species from Russia. To ascertain the spatial or geographic
variation of SWSV, archival liver tissues from 88 Eurasian common shrews, trapped in Finland in
1982 and in Hungary during 1997, 1999 and 2000, were analyzed for hantavirus RNAs by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. SWSV RNAs were detected in 12 of 22 (54.5%) and 13
of 66 (19.7%) Eurasian common shrews from Finland and Hungary, respectively. Phylogenetic
analyses of S- and L-segment sequences of SWSV strains, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian
methods, revealed geographic-specific genetic variation, similar to the phylogeography of rodentborne hantaviruses, suggesting long-standing hantavirus-host co-evolutionary adaptation.

Findings
A paradigm-altering chapter in hantavirology is unfolding
with the discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses in
multiple species of shrews (Order Soricomorpha, Family
Soricidae), including the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) [1], Chinese mole shrew (Anourosorex
squamipes) [2], masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) [3], dusky
shrew (Sorex monticolus) [3], Therese's shrew (Crocidura
theresae) [4] and Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura
lasiura) [5]. Also, whole-genome analysis of Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), a hantavirus isolated from the
Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) [6,7], demonstrates a
separate phylogenetic clade, consistent with an early evo-

lutionary divergence from rodent-borne hantaviruses
[8,9]. Moreover, recent identification of hantaviruses in
moles (Family Talpidae) further challenges the conventional view that rodents are the primordial reservoir hosts
of hantaviruses, and suggests that their evolutionary origins and zoogeographic history are far more ancient and
complex than formerly conjectured [10-12].
Previous analysis of the full-length S and partial M and L
segments of a newfound hantavirus, designated Seewis
virus (SWSV), detected in the Eurasian common shrew
(Sorex araneus), captured in the Swiss canton of
Graubünden [13], corroborates earlier reports of hantaviPage 1 of 6

ral antigens in this shrew species from Russia, Belgium
and the former Yugoslavia [14-16]. As its name implies,
the Eurasian common shrew (Subfamily Soricinae) is
among the most widely dispersed small mammal species
in Eurasia. Its vast geographic range, which extends
throughout Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and
Great Britain (but excluding Ireland), and across Russia
(Fig. 1), provided an opportunity to investigate the
genetic diversity and phylogeography of SWSV.
Archival liver tissues from 88 Eurasian common shrews,
trapped in Finland in 1982 and in Hungary during 1997,
1999 and 2000 (Table 1 and Fig. 1), were retrieved from
deep-freeze storage at the Museum of Southwestern Biology, of the University of New Mexico. Total RNA was
extracted using the PureLink Micro-to-Midi total RNA
purification kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and cDNA
was synthesized using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and an oligonucleotide primer
(OSM55: 5'-TAGTAGTAGACTCC-3'), designed from the
genus-specific conserved 3'-end of the S, M and L segments of all hantaviruses. For reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), primers, based on
highly conserved regions of shrew-borne hantavirus
genomes, were employed: S (outer: 5'-TAGTAGTAGACTCC-3', 5'-AGCTCNGGATCCATNTCATC-3'; inner:

cycling conditions and methods for DNA sequencing have
been previously described [3,11,12].
SWSV RNAs were detected by RT-PCR in 12 of 22 (54.5%)
and 13 of 66 (19.7%) Eurasian common shrews from Finland and Hungary, respectively (Table 1). Prevalence of
SWSV infection was as high as 77.8% (7 of 9) in Oulun
Lääni, Finland, and as low as 6.3% (3 of 48) in Zala, Hungary. Analysis of the partial S- and L-genomic sequences of
SWSV showed considerable divergence from the SWSV
prototype mp70 strain at the nucleotide level (Table 2): S,
11.9-19.4%; and L, 18.1-21.8%. However, the S- and Lsegment nucleotide sequence variation of SWSV strains
within a specific geographic region was low, ranging from
0-0.7% and 0-1.0% in Etelä-Suomen, 0.3-1.3% and 06.0% in Oulun Lääni, 0.2-4.9% and 0-4.6% in GyörSopron-Moson, and 0.2% and 0-2.6% in Zala. Moreover,
there was strong conservation of the encoded proteins
with ≤ 3.1% variation at the amino acid level among
SWSV strains from Finland, Hungary and Switzerland.
An exception was the partial S-segment sequence of SWSV
strain DGR18890 from Oulun Lääni, which was highly
incongruent, showing marked divergence of nearly 20%
at the nucleotide and amino acid levels (Table 2). Analysis, using multiple recombination-detection methods,
including GENECONV, Bootscan, Chimaera, 3SEQ, RDP,
SiScan, MaxChi and HyPhy Single Recombinant Breakpoint [17], failed to disclose any evidence of recombination. However, analyses of full-length genomic sequences
of SWSV strains would be required to demonstrate intralineage recombination events. Apart from the above-mentioned incongruity, the inability to amplify the S segment
in six of the 25 L-segment RT-PCR positive tissues, despite
repeated attempts using numerous primers, may be the
result of low viral titers or inadequate sensitivity of the
PCR primers. Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this
important issue.
Phylogenetic analyses of the 250-nucleotide S- and 400nucleotide L-segment sequences, generated using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, implemented in
PAUP* (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, 4.0b10)
[18], RAxML Blackbox web-server [19] and MrBayes 3.1
[20], under the best-fit GTR+I+Γ model of evolution using
jModeltest 0.1.1 [21], showed geographic-specific clustering of SWSV strains (Fig. 2), similar to the phylogeographic variation demonstrated previously for rodentborne hantaviruses, including Hantaan virus in the
striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) [22], Soochong

Tula virus in the European common vole (Microtus arvalis)
[29] and Andes virus in the long-tailed colilargo (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) [30]. Identical topologies resulted
from analysis of longer S-segment sequences of SWSV
strains (Table 2).
Because shrews are inherently difficult to identify by morphological features alone, host verification of SWSVinfected shrews was confirmed by analyzing voucher specimens and sequencing the entire 1,140-base pair cyto-

chrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
amplified by PCR, using previously described universal
primers (5'-CGAAGCTTGATATGAAAAACCATCGTTG-3'
and
5'-GCAGCCCCTCAGAATGATATTTGTCCAC-3').
mtDNA sequences were deposited into GenBank
(GQ374412-GQ374437), and the identities of the 25
hantavirus-infected hosts were assessed using a Bayesian
approach (5 million generation with burn-in of 5000 discarded) that was mid-point rooted (tree not shown). All
SWSV-infected shrews were confirmed as Sorex araneus.
However, the Eurasian common shrew exhibits significant
chromosomal polymorphism throughout its geographic
range [31]. Previous studies suggest that several chromo-

based on 30,000 trees: two replicate Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs consisting of four chains of two million generations each

somal races of Eurasian common shrews are present in
Finland and Hungary. Whether or not the sub-lineages of
SWSV can be traced to potentially distinct evolutionary
histories of these races is a matter of conjecture and
requires future investigation.
Because the original report of SWSV was based on a single
Eurasian common shrew from Switzerland [13], there has
been understandable reluctance in fully accepting this
hantavirus-soricid association. Data from the present
study, however, provide compelling evidence that this
soricine shrew species harbors SWSV across its broad geographic range. As further support, in a separate study,
Sorex araneus, as well as the tundra shrew (Sorex tundrensis)
and Siberian large-toothed shrew (Sorex daphaenodon),
have been shown to harbor genetic variants of SWSV in six
widely separated administrative regions of Western and
Eastern Siberia [32]. Similarly, the American water shrew
(Sorex palustris), Trowbridge's shrew (Sorex trowbridgii)
and vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) in North America harbor genetic variants of Jemez Springs virus (H.J. Kang and
R. Yanagihara, unpublished), which was originally found
in the dusky shrew [3]. When viewed within this context,
the demonstration of SWSV in Eurasian common shrews
from Finland and Hungary lends support to the hypothesis that common ancestral hantaviruses established themselves in ancestors of present-day soricine shrew species,
with subsequent cross-species transmission and local
host-specific adaptation.

As noted, SWSV RNAs were found in Eurasian common
shrews captured in Finland more than 25 years ago. Analysis of hantavirus sequences amplified from tissues of Eurasian common shrews and other soricine shrew species
more recently trapped in these same sites in Finland
would be extremely valuable, in providing insights into
the evolutionary rate of SWSV. Such studies are now
underway.
The emerging story of previously unrecognized hantaviruses in soricomorphs has been greatly accelerated by the
availability of an extensive, meticulously curated, smallmammal frozen-tissue collection, housed at the Museum
of Southwestern Biology. That is, while these tissues were
not collected for the purposes of our current and past
studies, their ready accessibility has facilitated the rapid
acquisition of new knowledge about the spatial distribution of hantaviruses in nonrodent reservoir hosts [2,3,12].
As such, these opportunistic studies provide convincing
justification and strong testament for the establishment
and long-term maintenance of these repositories for
future scientific inquiry. Additional hantaviruses and
other zoonotic agents are likely to be successfully mined
from such banked tissues, by employing powerful microarray and ultra high-throughput sequencing technologies.
