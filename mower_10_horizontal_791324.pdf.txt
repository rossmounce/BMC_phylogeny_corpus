genes from a parasitic plant followed by gene
conversion with host mitochondrial genes

Abstract
Background: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is relatively common in plant mitochondrial genomes but the
mechanisms, extent and consequences of transfer remain largely unknown. Previous results indicate that parasitic
plants are often involved as either transfer donors or recipients, suggesting that direct contact between parasite
and host facilitates genetic transfer among plants.
Results: In order to uncover the mechanistic details of plant-to-plant HGT, the extent and evolutionary fate of
transfer was investigated between two groups: the parasitic genus Cuscuta and a small clade of Plantago species.
A broad polymerase chain reaction (PCR) survey of mitochondrial genes revealed that at least three genes (atp1,
atp6 and matR) were recently transferred from Cuscuta to Plantago. Quantitative PCR assays show that these three
genes have a mitochondrial location in the one species line of Plantago examined. Patterns of sequence evolution
suggest that these foreign genes degraded into pseudogenes shortly after transfer and reverse transcription (RT)PCR analyses demonstrate that none are detectably transcribed. Three cases of gene conversion were detected
between native and foreign copies of the atp1 gene. The identical phylogenetic distribution of the three foreign
genes within Plantago and the retention of cytidines at ancestral positions of RNA editing indicate that these
genes were probably acquired via a single, DNA-mediated transfer event. However, samplings of multiple
individuals from two of the three species in the recipient Plantago clade revealed complex and perplexing
phylogenetic discrepancies and patterns of sequence divergence for all three of the foreign genes.
Conclusions: This study reports the best evidence to date that multiple mitochondrial genes can be transferred via
a single HGT event and that transfer occurred via a strictly DNA-level intermediate. The discovery of gene
conversion between co-resident foreign and native mitochondrial copies suggests that transferred genes may be
evolutionarily important in generating mitochondrial genetic diversity. Finally, the complex relationships within
each lineage of transferred genes imply a surprisingly complicated history of these genes in Plantago subsequent
to their acquisition via HGT and this history probably involves some combination of additional transfers (including
intracellular transfer), gene duplication, differential loss and mutation-rate variation. Unravelling this history will
probably require sequencing multiple mitochondrial and nuclear genomes from Plantago.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the transmission of
genes across species boundaries and/or mating barriers.
HGT plays a major role in prokaryotic evolution, where

it occurs through such well-studied processes as transformation, conjugation and transduction [1,2]. HGT is
also relatively common and evolutionarily important in
certain phagotrophic protists [3-6], with food prey often
serving as the source of these transferred genes [7].
However, relatively few cases of HGT have been
reported in most multicellular, non-phagotrophic

eukaryotes and little is known about the mechanisms of
transfer [8].
For the most part, HGT in plants is comparable to
that of other multicellular eukaryotes - it is a rare
phenomenon. Despite intense investigations of genetically modified crops, due to the potential for transgene
escape, there are very few examples of plants donating
genes to any non-plant species [9]. Other than the massive migration of bacterial genes into the nucleus after
the endosymbiotic establishment of the mitochondrion
and plastid [10-12], the transfer of non-plant genes into
plants is also uncommon. Perhaps the best examples
come from the transfer of infectious plasmids from
Agrobacterium [13,14], the transfer of a mobile group I
intron from a fungus [15,16] and the ancient transfer of
a few fungal genes into angiosperm nuclear genomes
[17]. Horizontal transmission between plants, at the
nuclear level, has so far been documented for only a few
transposable elements and genes [18-21]. At the plastid
level, plant-to-plant HGT is apparently non-existent or
at least exceedingly rare. No cases were discovered after
the examination of 42 complete plastid genomes from
representative green plants and red algae plus a single
glaucophyte [22] and no reports have emerged from the
many subsequently-sequenced plastid genomes.
Although plastid and nuclear gene transfer appears to be
rare among plants, a significant body of evidence indicates
that plant-to-plant transfer of mitochondrial genes occurs
with surprising frequency (for examples see [23-31]). In
most cases, the mechanisms of mitochondrial transfer
remain speculative, with possibilities including: direct contact between donor and recipient plants; uptake of DNA
from the environment; and transfer of DNA via vectors
such as viruses, bacteria or fungi [23-25]. However, various
lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial HGT is facilitated by direct cell-to-cell contact between different species, involving parasitism and, perhaps, grafting [32].
Several studies have suggested, largely on phylogenetic
grounds, that plant mitochondrial genes move from host
to parasite [26,28] or from parasite to host [27,29]. It has
been speculated that haustorial connections, which allow
the passage of macromolecules, viruses and phytoplasmas
between parasitic plants and their host plants, may also
facilitate HGT [26-28]. Evidence that experimental grafting enables frequent plastid gene transfer suggests that it
may also be an evolutionarily important route of mitochondrial HGT [33].
Despite these important findings, much about the
mechanism of mitochondrial horizontal transfer remain
largely unclear. One reason is that it is not known
whether the transferred genetic material is DNA or RNA.
In a related phenomenon - intracellular gene transfer - it
has been established that mitochondrial genes can
integrate into the nucleus through either an RNA

Page 2 of 16

intermediate [34,35] or directly via DNA [36-38]. Therefore, either or both routes may also be available for HGT.
Another largely unanswered question is whether the
nucleic acid is nakedly transferred or packaged inside a
vector. Double-stranded genomic DNA is known to persist for thousands of years in specific environmental
conditions [39,40], whereas single-stranded RNA or complementary DNA (cDNA) is not expected to fare as well.
Potential vectors for a packaged transfer include viruses,
bacteria, fungi, insects and mitochondria themselves.
This last route is supported by two observations: transfer
may occur by direct contact between donor and recipient
plants; and plant mitochondria (but not plastids) are well
known to fuse [41,42], accompanied by intergenomic
recombination in somatic hybrids [43,44]. Finally, which
of the three plant genomes is the site of integration of
foreign plant mitochondrial genes is largely unexplored.
Although some analyses have provided evidence for
mitochondrial integration [23,25,30,31], the possibility
that foreign sequences of mitochondrial origin reside,
instead, in the nucleus has been raised [45,46] because
nuclear (but not plastid) genomes readily incorporate
sequences of mitochondrial origin, at least via intracellular gene transfer [36-38].
We previously reported on two independent cases of
horizontal transfer of the mitochondrial atp1 gene from
different parasitic plant groups into genus Plantago [27].
In one case, we identified the donor group as the parasitic genus Cuscuta (dodders; Convolvulaceae) and the
recipient as the common ancestor of a small clade of
three closely-related Plantago species, Plantago coronopus, P. macrorhiza and P. subspathulata (out of 43 species sampled). As this transfer event was recent, and the
donor and recipient lineages are well-defined, it is an
excellent case in which to address some of the outstanding mechanistic issues of HGT. Furthermore, we should
be able to distinguish between DNA and RNA mediated
mechanisms of transfer by examining historical patterns
of cytidine to uridine (C-to-U) RNA editing which occurs
in almost all plant mitochondrial transcripts [47-53]. In
the course of this investigation we discovered two additional mitochondrial genes that have been transferred
from Cuscuta into the same group of three closelyrelated Plantago species, which suggests that a large portion of the mitochondrial genome was transferred. Phylogenetic and other analyses shed light on the mechanism
of transfer and also reveal an intriguingly complex history
of these genes subsequent to their acquisition.

Results
Horizontal transfer of multiple genes from Cuscuta to
Plantago

In order to determine whether other mitochondrial
genes were transferred between Cuscuta and Plantago,

Mower et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:150

potentially via the same transfer event, a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based survey of 38 protein and
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes that were present in the
mitochondrial genome of the ancestral eudicot [54] was
undertaken for P. coronopus and C. gronovii using a
comprehensive set of mitochondrial primers that had
been developed earlier [25]. We succeeded in amplifying
(and sequencing) only 10 of the 38 genes from both species. These genes were subjected to preliminary phylogenetic analyses using sequence data available in GenBank
(data not shown). In addition to the previously identified
atp1 gene, the atp6 and matR genes also showed clear
evidence of horizontal transfer from Cuscuta to Plantago in these preliminary analyses, whereas the other
seven genes are evidently native to Plantago. We failed
to recover a PCR product for the remaining 28 genes in
the survey from P. coronopus and these were not evaluated further. The high rate of amplification failure in
this species is probably due to the poor hybridization of
primers to the exceptionally divergent mitochondrial
genes in Plantago [55-58] and to gene loss from the
mitochondrial genomes, which is a common phenomenon for many plant species [11,54]. The high level of
point mutations and indels in the putative horizontally
transferred genes identified here (Additional File 1)
suggests that additional HGT candidates may also have
been missed as a result of poor primer hybridization.
For all three genes for which preliminary analyses
indicated HGT, homologs from diverse representatives
of the Lamiales (including Plantago and other Plantaginaceae), Solanales (including Cuscuta and other Convolvulaceae) and Gentianales were PCR amplified and
sequenced or collected directly from GenBank (Additional File 2). In addition, in order to evaluate the
within-species diversity of HGT, these genes were
sequenced from up to four different P. coronopus lines
(referred to for convenience as A, B, C and D) and from
two different P. macrorhiza lines (A and B; Additional
File 3). These sequences were aligned and phylogenetic
analyses were performed using maximum likelihood
(Figure 1). In each case, a Plantago clade of species was
found nested within Lamiales (with strong bootstrap
support of 93%-100%) and, more specifically, within
Plantaginaceae (with strong support for matR only), the
expected position for native Plantago genes. For atp1,
native copies were previously isolated from 43 species of
Plantago [27] but only six species are shown here: the
focal species in the ‘P. coronopus clade’ (P. coronopus,
P. macrorhiza and P. subspathulata) and three additional species (P. crassifolia, P. maritima and P. lanceolata) that represent lineages of increasing divergence
relative to the focal group [59,60]. For atp6 and matR,
sampling was limited to the species shown: no additional species were attempted or sequenced.

Page 3 of 16

In addition to the native copies of atp1, atp6, and matR,
a second copy of each of these genes was amplified
from P. coronopus and P. macrorhiza. A second copy of
atp1 and matR was also amplified from P. subspathulata. These additional copies all group in an anomalous
position, together with or within Convolvulaceae (Solanales), with high bootstrap support (Figure 1). Moreover, in each case, they are nested within the parasitic
genus Cuscuta, a position that is weakly supported
for two genes and strongly supported (90%) for atp6
(Figure 1). Taken together, the strongly supported placement of these sequences within Convolulaceae, their
close affinity with Cuscuta and their strongly supported
exclusion from the Plantago clades of native homologs
indicate that all three genes were probably transferred
horizontally from a species of Cuscuta into the common
ancestor of P. coronopus, P. macrorhiza and P. subspathulata. [Note that none of the three genes was
recovered from either P. crassifolia or P. maritima, the
two successively sister lineages of the P. coronopus
clade.]
Errors in phylogenetic reconstruction can lead to erroneous claims of HGT. However, this is unlikely to be
the case here. For each gene, the phylogenetic position
of the putative foreign copies is robust; their placement
was unaffected by choice of phylogenetic method (maximum likelihood, parsimony or neighbour-joining), by
elimination of predicted sites of RNA editing from the
data, by removing the native Plantago genes from the
data or by broadening the taxon sampling to representatives from across core eudicots (Additional File 4).
Furthermore, for all three genes, the ShimodairaHasegawa test [61], which is a likelihood-based statistical test of alternative tree topologies, strongly rejected
(P < 0.05) the placement of the foreign clade within
Plantaginaceae in the position expected if the clade
arose by gene duplication rather than by HGT (Additional File 5). More generally, with the exception of the
anomalous placement of the foreign clade of Plantago
sequences, the strongly supported relationships throughout the rest of the three gene trees are consistent with
the currently accepted organismal phylogeny [62],
arguing against any pervasive phylogenetic issues.
It has been argued that nuclear-encoded fragments of
mitochondrial DNA (numts) may sometimes be mistaken for horizontally transferred DNA [45,46], perhaps
due to phylogenetic artifacts arising from the very different mutation rates in the two genomes. In general, however, numts should behave like gene duplications in
phylogenetic analyses and group with their mitochondrial progenitor sequences. As described above, this is
clearly not the case for the Plantago sequences. Indeed,
the strongly supported placement of the putatively
foreign Plantago copy of all three mitochondrial genes

Figure 1 Multi-gene horizontal transfer from Cuscuta to Plantago. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses of three mitochondrial
genes [atp1 (1272 bp), atp6 (615 bp) and matR (1878 bp)], two plastid regions [rbcL (984 bp) and trnL/trnF intergenic spacer (367 bp)] and the
nuclear internal transcribed spacer [ITS (696 bp)] are shown. All trees are drawn to the same scale (scale bar is at top right). Bootstrap values
>80% from 100 ML replicates are shown. ‘P’ denotes Plantago and ‘C’ Cuscuta. Lamiales are coloured in shades of red, with lighter red for
Plantaginaceae and darker red for the remaining families, except for three Plantago species involved in horizontal gene transfer, which are in
blue (Plantago coronopus), turquoise (P. macrorhiza) or violet (P. subspathulata). Solanales are in shades of grey, with lighter grey for
Convolvulaceae and darker grey for the remaining families. Gentianales are in green and served as outgroups to root the mitochondrial trees.

with Convolvulaceae (Solanales), convincingly apart
from the native Plantago homologs - which are well
embedded within multiple strongly supported lineages
of Lamiales (Figure 1) - makes the numt phylogenetic
artifact hypothesis untenable in the case of Plantago.
Misidentification or contamination of DNA is another
problem that can lead to incorrect inferences of HGT.
However, wholesale misidentification can be clearly
ruled out by the fact that intact sequences grouping
within Plantaginaceae have been obtained for multiple
loci (including 10 mitochondrial, six plastid and two
nuclear loci from P. coronopus) from all Plantago samples used in this study (Additional File 3) and during
our previous investigations of substitution rates [56].
Contamination of DNA stocks with some unknown secondary source can also be discounted. All horizontally
acquired copies were amplified and sequenced at least
twice from each DNA sample. Furthermore, at least two
independent DNA samples were prepared from each
plant grown at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
(Additional File 3). Finally, of all sequenced loci, only
atp1, atp6 and matR gave any indication that more than
one gene copy was present, and all of these additional
copies are clearly pseudogenes (see the next section). By
contrast, contamination with DNA from a different
plant would be expected to produce multiple gene
copies from more than just three of the 38 surveyed
mitochondrial genes, and all of the additional copies
should look functional.
Horizontally transferred genes are unexpressed
pseudogenes

An unusual characteristic of Plantago mitochondrial
genes is that their nucleotide sequences are highly divergent due to the unusually high mutation rates [55-58].
This is evident here for the native copies of atp1, atp6
and matR (Figure 1). Despite this divergence, all of the
native Plantago sequences are intact with no frameshifting indels or internal stop codons (Additional File 1). In
addition, all four native mitochondrial and plastid genes
from P. coronopus line C examined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR - including the native atp1 and matR
genes - were found to be transcribed (Figure 2), as were
the native atp1 and matR genes from P. macrorhiza line
B (data not shown). The smaller size and the presence
of three C-to-U changes in the P. coronopus cox1 cDNA
relative to genomic DNA (Figure 2, lane 3) indicate that
the transcript had undergone intron splicing and RNA
editing, which verifies that the cDNA sample was indeed
derived from RNA. Thus, the native atp1, atp6 and
matR genes are likely to be bona fide genes encoding
functional Plantago mitochondrial proteins.
All of the foreign genes are also divergent relative to
other taxa (Figure 1). However, they are almost certainly

Figure 2 Expression of native and foreign genes. Primers were
used to amplify the following genes from Plantago coronopus line
C: (1) plastid rbcL; (2) native atp1; (3) native cox1; (4) native matR; (5)
foreign atp1; (6) foreign atp6; and (7) foreign matR. Three templates
were used for amplification: DNA (D), reverse-transcribed RNA (R)
and a negative control (N).

nonfunctional because they contain indels that disrupt
the reading frame and often introduce premature stop
codons (Additional File 1). Despite the clear indications
of pseudogenization at the DNA level, it is possible that
the horizontal copies are nonetheless still transcribed.
We assayed all three foreign genes from P. coronopus
line C and P. macrorhiza line B and could not detect
transcripts from any of them (Figure 2 and data not
shown). Thus, it appears that the horizontally transferred genes are unexpressed pseudogenes.
Phylogenetic incongruence within clades of horizontally
acquired genes

We amplified and sequenced native copies of three
mitochondrial genes (atp1, atp6 and matR), two plastid
regions (rbcL and intergenic trnL/trnF) and the internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal repeat
from 4-6 species of Plantago, including multiple P. coronopus and P. macrorhiza lines for most genes, and at
least two other members of Plantaginaceae (Figure 1).
Phylogenetic relationships for all native loci are consistent with previous phylogenies [59,60,63], although it
should be noted that the particular relationship among
P. coronopus, P. macrorhiza and P. subspathulata is not
resolved here or elsewhere ([59,60]; JPM and JDP,
unpublished data).
We also sequenced foreign copies of all three mitochondrial genes from the six different P. coronopus and
P. macrorhiza lines. Surprisingly, the sequences from
the different P. coronopus lines were never monophyletic
and the P. macrorhiza lines were not monophyletic for
the atp6 and matR genes (Figure 1). Furthermore, the
phylogenetic relationship among the foreign atp1
sequences varies dramatically compared to the topology
for matR and atp6. For example, P. coronopus line A
groups with lines B and C for atp1 but with line D for

Mower et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:150

atp6 and matR. The inconsistent and reproducible
phylogenetic pattern for various lines rules out seed
misidentification as the source of taxonomic conflict
and indicates a complicated evolutionary history for
these pseudogenes.
Complex patterns of sequence divergence in horizontally
transferred genes

An unexpectedly complex history of the foreign genes
following their arrival in Plantago is also indicated by
patterns of sequence divergence (Figure 1, Additional
File 1). There are very few if any nucleotide differences
among the native mitochondrial copies of atp1, atp6
and matR within the P. coronopus clade of three species.
In fact, the most divergent sequences within the P. coronopus clade for native mitochondrial genes are >99%
identical to one another, which is comparable to divergence levels of plastid sequences sampled from the same
plants. In stark contrast, the foreign genes are much
more divergent. The most divergent sequences for the
foreign genes are only 90%, 92% and 84% identical for
atp1, atp6 and matR, respectively, and these extremes of
divergence actually reside among the multiple lines of
P. coronopus sampled.
In order to explore this rate variation further, we used
a codon-based model of sequence evolution to evaluate
synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) divergence
for native and foreign homologs from particular species
pairs (Table 1). These analyses corroborate patterns
observed by simple comparison of sequence identities:

the native mitochondrial genes are essentially identical
to one another, whereas the foreign homologs are much
more divergent. Levels of synonymous divergence are
15-25 times higher between the foreign pseudogenes
from P. coronopus and P. macrorhiza compared to
native genes from the same species. Results from individual gene dS analyses are generally consistent with the
combined analysis (Table 1). Non-synonymous values
are more variable, which is probably the result of differential selection pressures acting on the genes, even the
pseudogenes to some extent because ω < 1 in all cases.
The differences in the substitution rate between the
native and foreign homologs suggest that either: (1) they
do not reside in the same genome; (2) they are in the
same genome but there is intra-genomic variability in
the rate of synonymous substitution; or (3) not all of the
foreign copies isolated for a particular gene are orthologous to one another. However, it should be pointed out
that certain subclades of foreign genes have levels of
sequence divergence similar to native copies and relationships that are, in fact, consistent with organismal
phylogeny. These are the subclades comprising P. coronopus B and C and P. subspathulata for atp1 and
P. coronopus A and D and P. macrorhiza A for atp6.
Multiple gene conversions of foreign atp1 by native atp1

The presence, owing to HGT, of two different copies of
each of these three genes in the same plant prompted
us to search systematically for evidence of any history of
gene conversion between xenologs. The OrgConv
program [64] failed to find evidence of gene conversion
in atp6 and matR but detected three significant (P <
0.001) candidate cases of gene conversion in atp1 (Figure 3). The first conversion event was identified in the
foreign genes from P. coronopus lines A-C and P. subspathulata. With the exception of a single autapomorphy in P. coronopus B and C, all four foreign genes are
identical over a 40 nt region (positions 150-189) to the
native atp1 genes of P. coronopus and P. macrorhiza but
differ from the Cuscuta sequence (representing the
donor group) at six or seven sites (Figure 3a). We therefore infer a native-to-foreign gene conversion event in
the common ancestor of these four foreign atp1
sequences. The second example of gene conversion was
found in the foreign atp1 genes from P. macrorhiza
lines A and B. In these two lines, a 15 nucleotide (nt)
region (positions 298-312) is identical to the native atp1
copy from both P. macrorhiza and P. coronopus but differs from Cuscuta atp1 at five sites and from the other
foreign Plantago atp1 genes at six sites (Figure 3a). The
third conversion also involves the foreign atp1 gene
from P. macrorhiza line B and is found only in this
sequence. However, unlike the previous example, the
converting sequence does not appear to be the native P.

Figure 3 Gene conversion between the native and foreign copies of atp1. (A) Sections of the atp1 alignment that demonstrate three
examples of gene conversion of the foreign pseudogene copies by functional native copies from Plantago. Regions of putative gene conversion
are highlighted in blue when the converting and converted sequences are from the same individual and in green when the interacting
sequences are from apparently different species (see text). The full atp1 alignment is available in Additional File 1a. (B) Maximum likelihood (ML)
phylogenetic analysis of the mosaic evolutionary history of the foreign atp1 copy from Plantago macrorhiza line B (green). For this analysis, the
sequence spanning nt 582-738 was separated from the rest of the P. macrorhiza B foreign atp1 sequence and both regions were included in the
data set as independent sequences. All other converted regions, including the two other regions shown in (A) and the region converted by
plastid atpA (Additional File 1a; [71]), were excluded prior to phylogenetic analysis. The final alignment contained 1185 bp. Bootstrap values
>80% from 100 ML replicates are shown.

macrorhiza atp1 gene. Instead, the 157-nt, putative conversion region (positions 582-738) is most similar to P.
sericea (Figure 3a), a distantly related species of Plantago in a different subgenus. Phylogenetic analysis places
this converted region strongly with native atp1 genes
from P. lanceolata and P. sericea (89% bootstrap support), specifically as sister to P. sericea, whereas the
unconverted sections of this sequence group in the originally identified position with the foreign atp1 copy of
P. macrorhiza line A (Figure 3b).
Although gene conversion was detected for atp1 but
not atp6 or matR, conversion is not the cause of the
different phylogenetic relationships observed among the
foreign copies of atp1 compared to the other two genes
(Figure 1). When we removed all converted regions
from the atp1 data, the resulting phylogenetic tree
(Additional File 4c) had the same topology as seen in
the initial analysis (Figure 1).
Mitochondrial location of horizontally transferred genes

In previous studies [23,25,30,31], a mitochondrial location for horizontally acquired genes was inferred by
finding sites of RNA editing in their transcripts. However, expression was not detected for any of the foreign
copies identified here (Figure 2), so we took advantage
of the fact that the mitochondrial, plastid and nuclear
genomes differ widely in copy number in plant cells to
determine the compartmental location of these unexpressed pseudogenes. The plastid genome is generally
present in hundreds to thousands of copies per leaf cell,
the mitochondrial genome in tens to hundreds of copies
per cell and the nuclear genome usually only in two
copies per cell [65,66]. As a precedent, we point out
that the differential copy number between nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes has enabled an accurate estimation of genome location by Southern blot hybridization
(for example, [54,55]). Here we use quantitative (q) PCR
instead of blots for two reasons: the intrinsically quantitative nature of qPCR and the opportunity to factor out
sequence divergence (by using primers that perfectly
match all sequences; Southern blot studies can be confounded by differential substitution rates, both between
mitochondrion and nucleus, and among plant lineages).
QPCR was performed with primers designed to known
loci in the nuclear (phyA), mitochondrial (native atp1
and cox1) and plastid (rbcL and intergenic spacer trnL/
trnF) genomes, as well as to the horizontally acquired
pseudogenes (atp1, atp6 and matR). All eight of these
regions were amplified from P. coronopus line C using
total genomic DNA, mitochondrial-enriched DNA and
plastid-enriched DNA and the relative intensities were
compared (Figure 4). The known mitochondrial, plastid
and nuclear genes display patterns generally consistent
with expectation, although mitochondrial DNA copy

Page 8 of 16

number in P. coronopus may be relatively low compared
to other plants. In the total DNA preparation (Figure
4a), the plastid genes are in the highest copy (lowest
cycle number), the nuclear gene is in the lowest copy
and the mitochondrial genes are at an intermediate
level. In the mitochondrial-enriched preparation (Figure
4b), the plastid DNA is still in the highest copy and the
nuclear DNA remains the lowest but the mitochondrial
DNA is shifted substantially to the left relative to the
other two genomes, indicating that considerable enrichment for mitochondrial DNA was indeed achieved. In
the plastid-enriched preparation (Figure 4c), all three
genomes are well-separated and, importantly, this preparation appears to be substantially enriched in both
plastid and mitochondrial sequences relative to nuclear
ones.
For all three preparations of plant DNA, the three foreign genes amplify at rates comparable to the two native
mitochondrial genes examined. This is most evident in
the plastid-enriched DNA which provides the greatest
separation among mitochondrial, plastid and nuclear
genes, but it is also consistent in the other two DNA
preparations. The clear and consistent association of the
three foreign atp1 genes with mtDNA in terms of copy
number indicates that, in P. coronopus line C at least,
they are located in the mitochondrion, most likely integrated into the mitochondrial genome.
Gene transfer was DNA mediated

There are a number of possible mechanisms of horizontal transfer, some of which include a stage involving
RNA. In order to test whether transfer occurred through
an RNA intermediate, we looked for evidence of C-to-U
RNA editing that occurs at multiple positions in nearly
all mitochondrial protein-gene transcripts from flowering plants [47-53]. If an RNA intermediate is involved,
there must be a point at which the transcript is reverse
transcribed back into cDNA. Assuming that reverse
transcription occurs after RNA editing of the transcript,
the edited positions containing U in the RNA will be
reverse transcribed to T residues in the cDNA. Thus, an
RNA-mediated gene transfer event should contain T
residues at most, or all, sites of RNA editing in the
original donor gene [34,35], whereas a transfer of genomic DNA should retain C residues at the edit sites.
A comparison of editing positions in Cuscuta to
homologous positions in the Plantago HGT copies
shows that there is no evidence for a massive C to T
conversion in Plantago that would be expected if the
transfer(s) was RNA mediated (Figure 5). Known edit
sites in six species were used to predict edit sites in
C. europaea using the RNA-editing prediction tool
PREP-Aln [67]. In total, 26 edit sites are predicted for
C. europaea: 1 in atp1, 15 in atp6 and 10 in matR. Of

transcription occurred from unedited transcripts, this
seems unlikely to have independently occurred for all
three genes because the majority of edited sites are
found fully edited in surveys of the mitochondrial transcript pool [47,50,51,53].

Figure 4 Genomic location of foreign genes. Quantitative
polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify five loci of known
genomic origin [plastid rbcL (light green) and trnL/trnF (dark green),
mitochondrial atp1 (light pink) and matR (dark pink) and nuclear
phyA (maroon)] and three foreign genes of uncertain provenance
[atp1 (light blue), atp6 (medium blue) and matR (dark blue)]. All
eight reactions were run in duplicate using as templates, either total
genomic DNA (A), mitochondrial-enriched DNA (B) or plastidenriched DNA (C) isolated from Plantago coronopus line C.

these, 22 are in regions also sequenced for the HGT
copies from P. coronopus and P. macrorhiza. P. macrorhiza has a cytidine at all 22 positions and P. coronopus
has 20 cytidines and only two thymidines. Thus, there is
essentially no evidence that the transfer event proceeded
through an RNA step. Although this analysis cannot
completely rule out the possibility that reverse

The finding, for three different genes, of a monophyletic
Plantago pseudogene group within the parasitic genus
Cuscuta indicates that a species of Cuscuta transferred
genetic material to the common ancestor of P. coronopus, P. macrorhiza and P. subspathulata (Figure 1).
Of the roughly 220 species in genus Plantago, these
three species (and the unsampled P. crypsoides) are
more closely related to one another than to all other
members [59,60]. As Cuscuta-like copies of atp1, atp6
and matR were not isolated from any species from the
remaining major clades of subgenus Coronopus or from
any member of the other subgenera, the timing of transfer can be assigned to the period prior to the radiation
of P. coronopus, P. subspathulata and P. macrorhiza and
subsequent to the split between their common ancestor
and the rest of subgenus Coronopus. Thus, this transfer
event is very recent, certainly within the last few million
years, given that the entire genus has been estimated to
be only 5-17 million years old [56,60]. As suggested previously [27], HGT was probably enabled by direct, physical contact between Cuscuta and Plantago during a
parasitic interaction. Indeed, Plantago is known to be at
least occasionally parasitized by Cuscuta [68,69].
Furthermore, many species of Cuscuta are native to the
same regions in the Mediterranean as P. coronopus, P.
subspathulata and P. macrorhiza [59,70], suggesting
that the HGT event occurred in this area.
The retention of cytidines in P. coronopus and
P. macrorhiza at edit sites in Cuscuta and related species (Figure 5) strongly points to DNA as the transferred
genetic material rather than RNA or cDNA. This finding, plus the phylogenetic distribution mentioned above,
strongly suggests that all three genes were acquired
together in a single transfer event. PCR was not performed to investigate whether these genes are adjacent
in any Cuscuta or Plantago genome. However, a survey
of the complete mitochondrial genomes from 17 seed
plant species in GenBank revealed that atp1, atp6 and
matR are usually separated by tens to hundreds of kb
and are never clustered together to the exclusion of any
other genes. The smallest segment in which these three
genes cluster in any of the sequenced seed plants is 39
kb in Triticum. Six other genes also cluster in this Triticum genomic segment. Thus, although it is possible that
these three genes were adjacent in the donor Cuscuta
mitochondrial genome, it is more likely that the transfer

Figure 5 Status of RNA edit sites in the foreign genes. Shown are those nucleotides in foreign Plantago genes that are known or predicted
to be edited in at least one of the other species listed. Edited cytidines are marked with the bold letter E and are shown in black if taken from
previous experimental analyses and in red if predicted. Cytidines in Plantago coronopus line C and P. macrorhiza line B that are homologous to
the predicted edit sites in C. europaea are highlighted in yellow, whereas thymidines are highlighted in red. Edit sites at third positions are
marked with an asterisk.

involved a large DNA fragment containing additional
genes and non-genic regions of the mitochondrial genome which, typically, are very large in plants with 80%90% of the genome consisting of intergenic spacer DNA.
It is even possible that an entire Cuscuta mitochondrial
genome was transferred. Although we did not detect
any additional HGT genes in the PCR-based survey, it
should be pointed out that we recovered data for only
10 Plantago genes out of the 30-40 typically present in
plant mitochondrial genomes and that the survey did
not examine intergenic regions. The possibility remains
that additional transferred sequences persist to this day
in one or more of these Plantago species or they may
have been historically present but have been lost at
some point after transfer.
Was the DNA transferred in a naked form or packaged inside a mitochondrion, virus, phytoplasma or
some other agent? It seems unlikely that a large, unassisted and unprotected fragment of DNA could successfully traverse the gauntlet of obstacles in the way of
successful transfer and, therefore, a packaged transfer
seems more likely. Whether the vehicle was a bacterium,
virus, mitochondrion or something else remains uncertain. Complete mitochondrial sequencing is underway
and should provide a significant insight into the
mechanisms of transfer between Plantago and Cuscuta,
including: whether additional mitochondrial genes from
Cuscuta were transferred; whether the transferred genes

cluster in the genome; and whether bacterial or viral
sequences are in the vicinity of the transfer.
The consequences of horizontal gene transfer between
plants

In order for a horizontal transfer event to be successful,
DNA must not only be transmitted from donor to recipient but also integrated into the recipient’s genome (in
meristematic tissue in the case of plants) and subsequently fixed throughout the population. The qPCR
results clearly indicate a mitochondrial location for
those foreign genes examined (Figure 4) but the phylogenetic incongruence between atp1 and the other two
genes (Figure 1) and the large difference in synonymous
substitution rate in the horizontal copies relative to
functional mitochondrial genes (Table 1) defy a simple
scenario of mitochondrial integration followed by strictly
vertical inheritance (see the next section).
Regardless of the point of integration, the three
Cuscuta-derived genes in Plantago have clearly degraded
into pseudogenes soon after acquisition by HGT. The
optimal value for ω was < 1 in all pairwise comparisons
(Table 1) suggesting that the transferred genes may have
been under functional constraint for some period of
time before they lost function. Alternatively, ω < 1 may
simply be a consequence of gene conversion which
would be expected to reduce ω at positions converted
by functional genes. The three conversion events

Mower et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/150

detected in the atp1 pseudogenes were excluded from
the ω calculations performed here but it is certainly possible that additional small-scale events remain undetected in the pseudogene sequences. Despite these
uncertainties, it is clear that these transferred genes did
eventually degrade into pseudogenes and probably did
not provide any selective advantage to the Plantago recipients. Thus, fixation of the transfer presumably
occurred by genetic drift.
From a broader perspective, the detection of gene
conversion in this study suggests that HGT among plant
mitochondrial genes may have greater evolutionary
significance than currently realized. Two of three cases
of putative gene conversion involving foreign pseudogenes provide straightforward evidence of conversion
between native and foreign genes that were probably
located in the same organism and genome. Although in
both cases it seems likely that the foreign pseudogenes
were converted by native functional homologs, the alternative scenario of native functional genes being converted by foreign genes is now certainly plausible (and
indeed has just been reported [31]) and could lead to
increased genetic diversity of the recipient mitochondrial
genome and, possibly, even adaptive benefits. The third
example of apparent gene conversion is much less
straightforward in interpretation and probably more
complicated in derivation, involving the conversion of
the foreign atp1 gene of one of two lines of P. macrorhiza examined by a P. sericea-like gene. Taking the
alignment (Figure 3a) and phylogenetic analysis (Figure
3b) of different parts of this gene at face value, it would
appear that P. macrorhiza line B acquired atp1 by HGT
twice, with an atp1 gene acquired from the P. sericea
lineage converting a short central segment of the atp1
pseudogene acquired from Cuscuta. Alternatively, this
segment in the foreign copy of atp1 may have been converted by a native copy of atp1 that is present in the
nucleus of P. macrorhiza, with the mutation rate heterogeneity responsible for the apparent phylogenetic conflict. That is, the synonymous substitution rate in the P.
macrorhiza mitochondrial lineage clearly has been much
higher than in P. sericea and may also be high compared
to the nuclear rate in P. macrorhiza (Figure 1[56]).
Therefore, the stronger similarity of this converted
region to P. sericea may simply reflect a greater retention of shared ancestral characters in the P. sericea
mitochondrial copy and the putative, native P. macrorhiza nuclear copy relative to the native P. macrorhiza
mitochondrial copy.
The detection of three separate conversion events in
this study illustrates the under-appreciated proclivity
of non-identical segments of DNA to intermix in plant
mitochondrial genomes. The often surreptitious nature
of these events is underscored by the fact that two of

Page 11 of 16

these converted regions, which are present in
sequences generated for the initial HGT report
between Cuscuta and Plantago [27], went undetected
for several years. Reports documenting the generation
of chimeric mitochondrial genes through recombination with horizontally acquired genes are becoming
increasingly common [23,30,31]. Furthermore, the
mitochondrial atp1 gene was recently shown to have
been converted by homologs of plastid origin on a
number of occasions during angiosperm evolution
[71,72]. Gene conversion between nuclear and mitochondrial sequences has yet to be reported, but the
converted region in P. macrorhiza B may be the result
of just such an interaction.
Causes of rate heterogeneity and phylogenetic
incongruence within clades of foreign Plantago genes

Numerous factors are known to cause substitution rate
variation or phylogenetic incongruence. The combination of both phenomena in all three horizontally
acquired genes suggests that they may be causally linked
in Plantago. One explanation is that we are comparing
paralogous or xenologous pseudogenes rather than
orthologs, resulting in phylogenetic incongruence,
potentially accompanied by longer branch lengths than
might otherwise be expected. These copies could result
from duplication of the foreign genes after an initial
horizontal transfer event or from multiple independent
transfer events from the same or different Cuscuta
donors. Differential gene loss or differential recovery by
PCR could then explain the phylogenetic incongruence
in different lines. As only one pseudogene copy was
obtained from each examined line, differential loss
would have to remove all but one pseudo-copy in each
lineage, which is perhaps unlikely. Differential PCR
recovery could occur because a given gene copy sustained mutations that make it a poor substrate for
amplification relative to the copy recovered and/or is
present in much lower copy number. This would be the
case if the recovered copy were on the major mitochondrial genome form and the other copy were present as
either a highly sub-stoichiometric form (such ‘sublimons’ are well known to occur in plant mitochondria
[73]) or, via intracellular gene transfer, in the nuclear
genome [65,66].
On top of these potentially confounding processes is
the possibility that substitution rates vary spatially and/
or temporally among the different genes and species
lines. This is suggested in comparisons of branch
lengths between the atp6 and matR foreign sequences
that otherwise share the same topology (Figure 1) and
in the overall higher level of divergence in foreign genes
relative to native (Figure 1, Table 1). Regional variation
in mitochondrial substitution rate, although not widely

Mower et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/150

observed in plants, has been reported in Silene [74,75].
At present, there is insufficient data to know whether
mutation rates might vary sharply within Plantago mitochondrial genomes. Trans-compartmental rate variation
is widely found in plants, with nuclear genomes generally evolving significantly faster than mitochondrial
genomes [76]. The situation is much more complicated
in Plantago, however, where highly elevated mitochondrial rates have been documented in large portions of
its phylogeny, but with subsequent marked decreases in
rates in most recently derived lineages, including, probably, the P. coronopus clade ([56]; JPM and JDP, unpublished data). Furthermore, almost nothing is known
about nuclear mutation rates in Plantago, especially in
the P. coronopus clade [the only nuclear sequence available for this group is ITS (Figure 1) which is problematic because it is non-coding and subject to concerted
evolution]. These many potential sources of rate variation could greatly exacerbate the phylogenetic uncertainties caused by extra pseudo-copies.

Conclusions
We provide here the strongest evidence yet that multiple mitochondrial genes can be transferred via a single
HGT event and we demonstrate that transfer occurred
via a DNA intermediate. Given that this HGT probably
involved a large segment of mitochondrial DNA, transfer via naked DNA or a viral vector is deemed unlikely.
Rather, transfer probably involved an organismal intermediate, either a relatively large vectoring agent (for
example, a bacterium, fungus or insect) or the donor
plant itself through a direct fusion of native and foreign
mitochondria (with foreign mitochondria spread perhaps
via illegitimate pollination, grafting or wounding). Also,
our results provide clear evidence for mitochondrial
integration of transferred genes. The detection of three
separate gene conversions between co-resident foreign
and native mitochondrial homologs suggests that transferred genes may be evolutionarily important in generating mitochondrial genetic diversity. The complex
relationships within each lineage of transferred genes
imply a surprisingly complicated history of these genes
in Plantago subsequent to their acquisition via HGT,
with this history likely involving some combination of
additional transfers (including intracellular transfer),
gene duplication and differential loss and mutation-rate
variation. Resolving the relative contributions of gene
duplication, horizontal and/or intracellular transfer and
substitution rate variation to the origin and diversification of these foreign genes will probably require complete mitochondrial and nuclear genome sequencing
from multiple individuals of the P. coronopus clade and
related taxa.

Methods
Sources of materials

Voucher information and source of seeds and DNAs for
all Plantago species used in this study are provided in
Additional File 3. Seeds were germinated and grown to
maturity in the Beadle Center Greenhouse (University of
Nebraska-Lincoln). Additional DNA samples used in the
study to generate sequence data were available from
previous studies [77-79].
Nucleic acid isolation

Total genomic DNA and RNA were isolated from fresh
leaves of greenhouse-grown plants using DNeasy and
RNeasy Plant Mini Kits (QIAGEN, CA, USA). At least
two DNA extractions were performed on separate occasions for each plant grown at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln (Additional File 3).
Plastid- and mitochondrial-enriched DNA was isolated
from P. coronopus line C using the differential-centrifugation portion of the protocol described in detail by
Palmer [80] and summarized here. Fifty grams of fresh,
young leaf tissue were homogenized in a Waring blender and then filtered through four layers of cheesecloth
followed by one layer of Miracloth. The filtrate was
centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei and
cellular debris. The suspension was transferred to a new
bottle and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min. The
pellet from this spin was retained as the chloroplastenriched fraction and the supernatant was centrifuged at
12000 × g for 20 min. The pellet from this last spin was
retained as the mitochondrial-enriched fraction. DNA
was isolated from the plastid- and mitochondrialenriched pellets using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit
(QIAGEN).
Polymerase chain reaction

Conventional PCR was performed on a PTC-100 (MJ
Research, Waltham, CT, USA) or PTC-0220G (Bio-Rad,
CA, USA) thermocycler using standard reaction conditions (initial step of 3 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 45 s at 48°C, 90-120 s at 72°C; final step of 10
min at 72°C). For the HGT survey, a previously developed set of 96 primer pairs covering most known mitochondrial protein and rRNA genes from plants [25] was
used on total DNA from P. coronopus line B and
C. gronovii. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses were performed to screen for potential cases of HGT. For all
potentially foreign genes, homologs were PCR-amplified
from additional species to increase taxon sampling. In
addition, putatively native copies were amplified from
total DNA using copy-specific primers designed to avoid
amplification of the foreign homologs. All PCR products
were purified and sequenced on both strands at the

Mower et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:150
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/150

Indiana Molecular Biology Institute (Indiana University,
Bloomington, USA) or the High-Throughput Genomics
Unit (University of Washington, Seattle, USA). All Plantago sequences reported in this study were amplified
and sequenced at least twice from each DNA extraction.
All newly generated sequences were deposited in GenBank (accessions HQ593736-HQ593805 and HQ593815HQ593837). Additional DNA sequences used in this
study were acquired from GenBank. Full lists of
sequences used are provided in Additional File 2.
QPCR assays were performed on a iCycler iQ thermocycler (Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer instructions.
QPCR primers were designed using the online RealTimePCR Tool with default parameters (Integrated DNA
Technologies, IA, USA). Primers were designed to
amplify eight loci from P. coronopus line C: five putatively native loci [mitochondrial atp1 (124 bp product)
and cox1 (140 bp), plastid rbcL (82 bp) and trnL/trnF
(135 bp) and nuclear phyA (137 bp)] and the three
putatively foreign genes [atp1 (73 bp), atp6 (77 bp)
and matR (135 bp)]. Designed primers averaged 19 bp
in length (range 18-22 bp), 49% GC content (range
43%-53%) and 60°C melting temperature (range 59°-61°
C). For each 20 μL reaction, 10 ng of DNA (plastidenriched, mitochondrial-enriched, or total genomic)
from P. coronopus line C was added. Each reaction was
run in duplicate. To ensure that all primer combinations amplified efficiently, a four-step series of five-fold
dilutions was performed starting from 25 ng total
genomic DNA and amplification efficiency was calculated using iCycler software. All products demonstrated an efficiency >90%.
RT-PCR was performed as described previously [79]
and summarized here. Purified RNA from P. coronopus
line C and P. macrorhiza line B was treated with
RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas) and then converted to
cDNA using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas)
and random hexamers (Fermentas) according to manufacturer instructions. In order to test for the presence of
genomic DNA contamination, a negative control reaction excluding reverse transcriptase was run in parallel
with the reaction that included reverse transcriptase.
Primers and PCR conditions used for RT-PCR were
identical to those used for conventional PCR.
Molecular evolutionary analyses

Sequence alignments were constructed with MUSCLE
version 3.7 [81] and manually adjusted when necessary
using BioEdit version 7.0.9 [82]. For pseudogenes with
frameshifting indels, the sequences were restored to
their ancestral reading frames by comparison with functional gene copies from closely-related sequences. This

Page 13 of 16

was necessary for calculations of synonymous and nonsynonymous sequence divergence. Poor-quality regions
of the alignments were excluded using Gblocks version
0.91b [83] with relaxed parameters including the minimum number of sequences for a flank position (b2) set
to 50%, minimum block length (b4) set to 5, and maximum number of species with gaps (b5) set to 50%.
For some analyses as indicated in the text, predicted
sites of C-to-U RNA editing were eliminated by converting them to T in the data sets. In order to predict edit
sites, data set sequences were first aligned to published
cDNA sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana, Beta
vulgaris, Citrullus lanatus, Vitis vinifera, Oenothera berteriana (for atp6 and matR) or O. biennis (for atp1) and
Oryza sativa (for atp1 and atp6) or Zea mays (for
matR). Edit sites were predicted in the data set
sequences by comparison to the cDNA sequences using
PREP-Aln [67] with a cutoff score of 0.2, and all
predicted sites were converted to T.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the maximum likelihood (ML) approach as implemented in
PhyML version 3.0 [84]. For each analysis, the general
time reversible (GTR) substitution model and subtree
pruning and regrafting (SPR) branch-swapping was
used. A gamma distribution with four rate categories
and the proportion of invariable sites were estimated
during the analysis. Each analysis was run five times
starting from different randomized tress. Support for the
ML topology was evaluated by bootstrapping with 100
ML replicates.
Pairwise levels of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) divergence were calculated with MEGA version 4.0.2 [85]. The Nei-Gojobori method was used with
a Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple hits and pairwise
deletion of gaps. Standard errors for the pairwise estimates were calculated using the bootstrap method with
500 replicates. Edit site effects were eliminated from the
analyses by coding all predicted sites as a T in the data
sets. Effects of atp1 gene conversion were eliminated
from the analysis by removing the affected codons from
the data set.
Recombination was detected by OnePop in the OrgConv package [64]. When the length of the detected
recombinant segment was longer than 100 nucleotides,
phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for both the
recombinant region and the remaining sequence using
PhyML as described above, and incongruence between
the regions was examined using the approximately
unbiased (AU) test [86]. Detected recombinant segments
were required to have a P-value < 0.001 to be considered significant, and when longer than 100 nucleotides,
the segment was required to have a P-value < 0.05 using
the AU test.
