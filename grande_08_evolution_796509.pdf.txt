Abstract
Background: Gastropod mitochondrial genomes exhibit an unusually great variety of gene orders
compared to other metazoan mitochondrial genome such as e.g those of vertebrates. Hence,
gastropod mitochondrial genomes constitute a good model system to study patterns, rates, and
mechanisms of mitochondrial genome rearrangement. However, this kind of evolutionary
comparative analysis requires a robust phylogenetic framework of the group under study, which
has been elusive so far for gastropods in spite of the efforts carried out during the last two decades.
Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of five mitochondrial genomes of gastropods
(Pyramidella dolabrata, Ascobulla fragilis, Siphonaria pectinata, Onchidella celtica, and Myosotella
myosotis), and we analyze them together with another ten complete mitochondrial genomes of
gastropods currently available in molecular databases in order to reconstruct the phylogenetic
relationships among the main lineages of gastropods.
Results: Comparative analyses with other mollusk mitochondrial genomes allowed us to describe
molecular features and general trends in the evolution of mitochondrial genome organization in
gastropods. Phylogenetic reconstruction with commonly used methods of phylogenetic inference
(ME, MP, ML, BI) arrived at a single topology, which was used to reconstruct the evolution of
mitochondrial gene rearrangements in the group.
Conclusion: Four main lineages were identified within gastropods: Caenogastropoda,
Vetigastropoda, Patellogastropoda, and Heterobranchia. Caenogastropoda and Vetigastropoda are
sister taxa, as well as, Patellogastropoda and Heterobranchia. This result rejects the validity of the
derived clade Apogastropoda (Caenogastropoda + Heterobranchia). The position of
Patellogastropoda remains unclear likely due to long-branch attraction biases. Within
Heterobranchia, the most heterogeneous group of gastropods, neither Euthyneura (because of the
inclusion of P. dolabrata) nor Pulmonata (polyphyletic) nor Opisthobranchia (because of the
inclusion S. pectinata) were recovered as monophyletic groups. The gene order of the
Vetigastropoda might represent the ancestral mitochondrial gene order for Gastropoda and we
propose that at least three major rearrangements have taken place in the evolution of gastropods:
one in the ancestor of Caenogastropoda, another in the ancestor of Patellogastropoda, and one
more in the ancestor of Heterobranchia.

Background
The animal mitochondrial (mt) genome is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule, which typically encodes for
two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins that are essential
for mitochondrial function [1]. The advent of long PCR
and automated sequence techniques has recently simplified and accelerated the determination of complete
sequences (about 16 Kb) of animal mtDNAs [2], and as of
May 2007 there were more than 1000 complete metazoan
mtDNAs deposited in GenBank [3]. Most (73%) of these
sequences were from vertebrate mtDNAs, which show a
relatively fixed genome organization with only few
instances of gene rearrangements [4,5]. Instead, changes
in gene order are widespread in non-vertebrate mt
genomes, and particularly frequent in several phyla such
as e.g. nematodes or mollusks [6]. Tandem duplication
followed by random loss of redundant genes has been
demonstrated to be the main mechanism for gene rearrangement of adjacent tRNAs in vertebrate mt genomes
[5]. However, other mechanisms such as illegitimate
recombination mediated by e.g. topoisomerases need to
be invoked to explain observed gene inversions, as well as
transpositions of genes to distant positions in non-vertebrate mt genomes [6]. In order to determine rates and
mechanisms of gene rearrangement in metazoans, additional comparative analyses of non-vertebrate mt genome
gene orders within an evolutionary framework are largely
wanting.
On the other hand, mt genome arrangement comparisons
may be useful for phylogenetic reconstruction [6,7]. For
these molecular markers, it is generally assumed that convergence is unlikely because of the great number of potential mt arrangements and the general low rate of
rearrangements. Therefore, the presence of rare mtDNA
gene orders shared by different taxa can be interpreted as
a result of common ancestry. However, structural constraints and the reported existence of hotspots for gene
rearrangement (e.g. near the origins of replication in vertebrate mt genomes, [5]) must increase the chances of
convergence [5,6]. Both Parsimony [8] and Bayesian
[9,10] methods are available to reconstruct phylogenies
based on genome arrangement data. However, these
methods have several limitations [9], and hitherto have
not been extensively applied. Further studies based on
larger genome arrangement data sets and more sophisticated methods of inference are expected to confirm the
potential of mt genome arrangements as phylogenetic
markers, as well as their performance and levels of homoplasy.
Gastropod mollusk mt genomes present high diversity of
gene orders [11], and offer a suitable model system to
study the rates and mechanisms of mt genome rearrangement, as well as the phylogenetic utility of arrangement

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/61

comparisons. Thus far, ten complete gastropod mt
genomes have been reported including Albinaria coerulea
[12], Cepaea nemoralis [13], Pupa strigosa [11], Roboastra
europea [14], Biomphalaria glabrata [15], Haliotis rubra [16],
Aplysia californica [17], Lottia digitalis and Ilyanassa obsoleta
[18], and Lophiotoma cerithiformis [19] (Fig. 1). In addition, the incomplete mt genomes of Euhadra herklotsi [20],
Littorina saxatilis [21], and Omalogyra atomus [22] have
been also described (Fig. 1). These mt genomes are all of
relatively reduced size (13–15 Kb) except that of L. digitalis, which has two large non-coding regions that increase
the total length of the mt genome up to 26 Kb [18].
Any meaningful evolutionary comparison between gastropod mt genome arrangements must rely explicitly on a
robust phylogeny of these mollusks. However, phylogenetic relationships among extant groups of gastropods are
the subject of a long-standing debate that lasts over a century [23-25]. The current classification of gastropods is a
consensus of phylogenetic hypotheses proposed by several authors (for example [26-34]) during the last two decades, and generally includes six major groups:
Patellogastropoda, Cocculiniformia, Neritopsina, Vetigastropoda, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia (Fig. 1).
Although the monophyly of these groups is well supported based both on morphological and molecular evidence, phylogenetic relationships among them are still
contentious. Morphological [26,28] but not molecular
data [30,34] support Patellogastropoda (Eogastropoda)
as the sister group of the remaining gastropods (Orthogastropoda) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, Caenogastropoda and
Heterobranchia are considered to be sister taxa (Apogastropoda) based both on morphological and molecular
data [28,34,35] (Fig. 1).
Out of the six major gastropod groups, Heterobranchia
seems to be the most heterogeneous one. This clade
includes the paraphyletic Heterostropha (Omalogyroidea, Pyramidelloidea, and other smaller groups) [26,28],
and Euthyneura, a monophyletic group that includes the
highly diversified Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata [24]
(Fig. 1). The phylogenetic relationships between the paraphyletic heterostrophan lineages and Euthyneura remain
unresolved, as well as the reciprocal monophyly of
Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata [e.g. [27,28,36,37]]. The
absence of a clear morphological distinction between pulmonates (land snails and slugs) and opisthobranchs (sea
slugs) has complicated the definition of both groups, with
some taxa (eg. Siphonariidae or Onchidiidae) historically
included in one or the other group depending on the characters considered [26,38-44]. Moreover, recent mt
sequence data analyses tentatively supported the paraphyly of opisthobranchs and the polyphyly of pulmonates [37,45,46].

each lineage, available complete and incomplete (marked with an asterisk) mt genomes are listed together with their corresponding GenBank accession numbers.

In this study, we analyze the evolution of mt gene order
arrangements within gastropods in order to gain insights
on rates and mechanisms of genome rearrangement
within the group. We sequenced anew the complete mt
genomes of five gastropods species including one representative of Heterostropha (Pyramidella dolabrata), one of
Opisthobranchia (Ascobulla fragilis), and three of Pulmonata (Siphonaria pectinata, Onchidella celtica, and Myosotella
myosotis). The newly reported sequences were aligned with
all available complete mt genomes of gastropods deposited in GenBank, and subjected to commonly used methods of phylogenetic inference in order to reconstruct a
robust phylogeny of gastropods. Genome arrangements
of all gastropod mtDNAs were mapped onto the recovered phylogeny in order to determine rearrangement

events, and to assess the phylogenetic utility of mt gene
order comparisons.

Results
Genome structural features
The main structural features of the five gastropod complete mt genomes that were sequenced anew in this study
are described in Table 1. Their total length ranges from
13,856 bp (P. dolabrata) to 14,745 bp (A. fragilis). Their
A+T content varies from 55% (M. myosotis) to 67% (A. fragilis). All of them encode a total of 37 (13 protein coding,
2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA) genes. Of these, 13 genes (trnQ,
trnL (uur), atp8, trnN, atp6, trnR, trnE, rrnS, trnM, nad3,
trnS (ucn), trnT, and cox3) are encoded in all the mt
genomes by the minus strand.

Overlapping of adjacent genes (even between genes
encoded by the same strand) is fairly common in the five
mt genomes. In almost all cases the overlap involves tRNA
genes, although cox1 gene overlaps with trnK gene in three
mt genomes (O. celtica, M. myosotis, and S. pectinata) and
with trnY gene in that of P. dolabrata (Fig. 2). In addition,
nad4 gene overlaps with trnS (agn) and trnT genes in P.
dolabrata. The total length of intergenic spacers is
extremely small for the P. dolabrata genome (89 bp),
medium for the S. pectinata, O. celtica, and M. myosotis
genomes (200–300 bp) and relatively long for the mt
genome of A. fragilis (644 bp) (Table 1). The longest noncoding region (173 bp) was found in the mt genome of O.
celtica between nad6 and nad5 genes. This region was
checked for potential secondary structures (stem loops or
tRNA-like structures) and repetitive motives. Putative
trnQ-like and trnF-like structures were found (Fig. 2). The
potential origin of replication was located in the five mt
genomes in a non-coding sequence between cox3 and trnI
genes by comparison with other gastropod genomes.
These non-coding sequences (42–53 bp long) have an
extremely high A+T content (Table 1).
Initiation and termination codons for the 13 protein coding genes encoded by the five mt genomes are summarized in Table 1. Most protein coding genes start with TTG,
although ATG, ATT, ATA and GTG are also common. The

ORFs normally end with TAG and TAA stop codons.
Incomplete stop codons (T or TA) are common in the two
smallest mt genomes (i.e. P. dolabrata and S. pectinata).
Interestingly, cox3 gene ends with the incomplete stop
codon T in all five mt genomes sequenced in this study.
The 22 tRNAs genes of each of the five mt genomes were
identified based on the corresponding anticodons, and
their typical cloverleaf secondary structure. All trnS genes
lack the DHU stem. In some tRNAs genes, the acceptor
stem is mispaired (Fig. 2). An extreme reduction in length
of the TΨC stem was observed in several tRNAs genes in
the mt genome of P. dolabrata (trnF, trnQ, trnG, trnH, and
trnT) (Fig. 2). Remarkably, nucleotide sequences of the
trnY and trnK of P. dolabrata are almost identical (Fig. 2).
Phylogeny of gastropods
The deduced amino-acid sequences of 12 mitochondrial
protein-coding genes (all except atp8) from 15 gastropods
and 3 cephalopods were combined into a single data set
that produced an alignment of 3,046 positions. Of these,
714 were invariant, and 1,870 were parsimony-informative. Mean character distances among ingroup taxa varied
between 0.11 (I. obsoleta and L. cerithiformis) and 0.60 (L.
digitalis and C. nemoralis). The average mean character distance was 0.37 (± 0.07) among Heterobranchia lineages,
0.46 (± 0.02) between Heterobranchia and Caenogastro-

A truncated TψC stem is shown in the trnQ of P. dolabrata (C). D and E indicate potential secondary structures found in the longest non-coding region of the mt genome of O. celtica. F and G show several proposed cloverleaf

The reconstructed Bayesian 50% majority rule consensus
tree (-lnL= 68443.87) based on the concatenated data set
is shown in figure 3. All nodes received maximal BPP support. MP (12,933 steps; CI = 0.67), ME (score = 3.10), and
ML (-lnL = 68,436.70) arrived at identical topology. All
nodes received high BP support except the sister group
relationships of P. dolabrata + O. celtica and P. strigosa + R.
europaea in the MP and ME analyses, respectively (Fig. 3).
In addition, neither MP nor ME analyses supported the
clade A. fragilis + S. pectinata. BI based on an amino acid
data set considering each mt gene as a different partition,
and using a partitioned mixed model of the combined

data recovered an almost identical tree (-lnL= 69881.74).
The only differences to the tree shown in Figure 3 were
that S. pectinata was recovered as sister group of A. californica to the exclusion of A. fragilis with low BPP support
(91%), and that the sister group relationship of P. dolabrata + O. celtica was not supported. All the other nodes
received maximal BPP support (not shown). An identical
topology to that shown in Figure 3 was recovered when
the polyplacophoran Katharina tunicata was used as outgroup (not shown).
Four main lineages were identified within gastropods:
Caenogastropoda (including I. obsoleta and L. ceritiformis),
Vetigastropoda (H. rubra), Patellogastropoda (L. digitalis)
and Heterobranchia (all remaining analyzed species).

According to the recovered tree, Caenogastropoda and
Vetigastropoda are sister group taxa, as well as Patellogastropoda and Heterobranchia (Fig. 3). Within Heterobranchia, neither Euthyneura nor Pulmonata nor
Opistobranchia were recovered as monophyletic groups
(Fig. 3). The monophyly of Euthyneura was strongly
rejected because the heterostrophan P. dolabrata was
recovered deep within Pulmonata + Opistobranchia (Fig
3). The recovered relative positions of Stylommatophora,
Ellobiidae, Basommatophora (non-monophyletic), and
Systelommatophora render Pulmonata polyphyletic
whereas Opisthobranchia is recovered paraphyletic due to
the inclusion within this group of the basommatophoran
pulmonate S. pectinata (Fig. 3).
The AU, SH and KH tests (Table 2) were performed to
evaluate whether alternative morphology-based hypotheses could be rejected based on the analyzed mt data set.
The AU and KH test values for the sister group relationship of Eogastropoda and Orthogastropoda, and the
monophyly of Apogastropoda, Euthyneura, Pulmonata,
and Basommatophora were = 0.01 in all cases. For the SH
test, all values for alternative hypotheses were = 0.01
except for the sister group relationship of Eogastropoda
and Orthogastropoda, and the monophyly of Apogastropoda. Overall, the performed tests showed that alternative
morphological hypotheses could be statistically rejected
based on our data set.
Evolution of gastropod mt genome arrangements
Each of the five newly determined gastropod mt genomes
exhibits a different gene order (Fig. 4). Moreover, among
all reported gastropod mt genomes only two sets of species (I. obsoleta + L. cerithiformis, and A. californiaca + P. strigosa) have the same gene order (Fig. 4). Despite the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/61

observed arrangement diversity, several general patterns
may be inferred. The gene order of the L. digitalis mt
genome is the most divergent among all gastropod mtDNAs sequenced thus far. The vetigastropoda H. rubra mt
genome has the same gene order of the cephalopod O.
vulgaris mt genome except for the relative position of three
tRNA (trnC, trnD and trnN) genes (Fig. 4). The identical
gene order exhibit by the two caenogastropod mt
genomes only differs from that of O. vulgaris in one translocation and one inversion (Fig. 4). Despite several
autapomorphies, all heterobranch mt genomes analyzed
in this study share a general conserved gene order, which
substantially differs from that of other gastropods (Fig. 4).
S. pectinata and P. dolabrata show several autapomorphies
that involve changes not only in the relative position of
tRNAs but also of some protein coding genes (cox2, nad4L,
and atp6) (Fig. 4). M. myosotis and C. nemoralis have
autapomorphic relative positions for nad4L and cox3
genes, respectively (Fig. 4). Changes in the remaining analyzed heterobranch mt genomes affect the arrangement of
trnW, trnY, trnC, trnP, and trnT genes (Fig. 4).
Genome arrangements were mapped onto the phylogenetic hypothesis presented in figure 3 in order to gain
insights on the patterns, rates, and mechanisms of gastropod mt genome rearrangements. The evolutionary comparative analyses showed that most gene rearrangements
occurred in the lineages leading to Patellogastropoda and
Heterobranchia, whereas Vetigastropoda and Caenogastropoda mostly retain the ancestral gene arrangement (as
represented in the analysis by the cephalopod mt genome
arrangement). Within Heterobranchia, rates of rearrangement seem to have significantly slowed down, and accelerated again in the lineages leading to P. dolabrata and S.
pectinata. Most inferred rearrangements involve tRNA

genes rather than protein coding genes. Furthermore,
changes in gene order are normally related with translocations, most moving to proximal regions but also some to
more distant regions. Among all inferred rearrangements,
only one instance of gene inversion between H. rubra and
the ancestor of the Caenogastropoda was found. In most
cases, rearrangements involve one or few genes. However,
the described inversion involved a genome fragment with
16 genes.
Attempts to recover phylogenetic relationships among
gastropods based on genome arrangement information
and using parsimony- or Bayesian-based methods of phylogenetic inference rendered highly unresolved trees (the
only sister-group relationships that were confidently
recovered were A. californica + P. strigosa and I. obsoleta +
L. cerithiformis, which each have identical gene order)
(data not shown).

Discussion
Evolutionary trends in the structural features of gastropod
mt genomes
The mt genomes of the gastropods sequenced so far contain the 37 genes described for the majority of mt
genomes within Metazoa [47]. This is not the case for
other groups of mollusks like bivalves, which lack some
genes (e.g. atp8, [48], but see [49]) or both bivalves and
cephalopods, which show duplicated genes (e.g. rrnS,
cox1, cox3, atp6, and atp8) [50-52]. This observation suggests that changes in gene content and number might be
exclusive features characterizing bivalves and cephalopods (unless new data from other groups of mollusks
points otherwise), and that gastropods maintain the
ancestral number of genes with no translocations of genes
to the nucleus and/or any signal of duplication events
(but see below for striking exceptions to this general rule).

The compact organization, gene order, and molecular features of the five heterobranch mt genomes sequenced
anew in this study fit well within the general description
of the gastropod mt genomes that have been sequenced so
far [11-20]. The small lengths of the genes and intergenic
spacers, as well as the high number of overlaps between
adjacent genes render gastropod mt genomes amongst the
smallest in size within Metazoa. The only exception to this
general trend is the relatively larger size of the mt genome
of the patellogastropodan L. digitalis, which is due to the
presence of several non-coding tandem repeat units.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain overlapping of adjacent mt genes that are transcribed from the
same strand, including the existence of multiple promoters, differential cleavage to generate diverse RNAs or posttranscriptional editing of the RNA [48]. All overlapping
events that can be observed in the five mt genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/61

described in this study are between adjacent tRNA genes
or between adjacent tRNA and protein coding genes and
could be explained by tRNA post-transcriptional mechanisms as described by Yokobori and Pääbo [53]. Observed
overlaps in the five gastropod mt genomes are restricted to
the acceptor stem, where the 5' end of the tRNAs overlaps
with the downstream gene. The nucleotides that overlap
seem to be part of the downstream gene while the complementary nucleotides needed in the acceptor stem of the
tRNA genes could be added by polyadenylation [53]. The
presence of truncated TΨC arms in many tRNA genes in P.
dolabrata could be the result of the extreme reduction in
length of the genes in the mt genome of this species.
Two tRNA-like structures (Q-like and F-like) were found
in the mt genome of O. celtica, in a non-coding region
between the protein coding genes nad6 and nad5. These
tRNA-like structures could result from duplication events
in the mt genome of O. celtica and may have been able to
remain as pseudogenes because they were located in a
non-coding region. It has been suggested that mt genes are
expressed as a polycistron, and that tRNA-like structures
might be related to the processing of the primary transcripts liberating the flanking gene specific mRNAs [20].
Due to the relevance of this hypothetical function, one
would expect to find these structures in high frequencies
in mt genomes. However, many protein coding genes in
the mt genomes of gastropods abut directly (without
tRNA genes or tRNA-like structures between them) and
only in very few cases some secondary structures have
been described [20]. Therefore, the genome organization
data available so far do not support the above-mentioned
hypothesis as a general mechanism for processing mRNAs
in mt genomes of gastropods, although further studies
based on the transcription and processing of mt genes in
this group are needed.
There is no general pattern in the use of initiation and termination codons in the 13 protein coding genes of the
five mt genomes analyzed in this study. Although a
strand-specific pattern of termination codon usage has
been described for the gastropod H. rubra [16], this does
not seem to be a general feature for gastropod mt
genomes. The use of incomplete termination codons (T,
TA) is especially high in the two mt genomes with smallest
sizes (i.e. P. dolabrata and S. pectinata). Post-transcriptional poly-adenylation could generate the complete termination codon [15,20]. Our results suggest that cox3
might be a very conserved gene both in length and in
codon usage within Gastropoda.
New insights into the phylogeny of Gastropoda
The reconstructed gastropod phylogeny based on 12 mt
protein-coding gene sequence data supports four natural
groups within Gastropoda: Vetigastropoda, Caenogastro-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:61

poda, Patellogastropoda, and Heterobranchia. The systematic validity of these groups is in full agreement with
most recent phylogenetic analyses based on morphological and molecular data [26,28,34]. Morphological analyses also distinguish two additional lineages within
gastropods including Neritopsina [28] and the enigmatic
Cocculiniformia [26]. Mt genomes of representatives of
these two groups need to be sequenced in the future to test
their phylogenetic position within gastropods.
Although many efforts have been made in the last years to
resolve phylogenetic relationships among the main lineages within Gastropoda, many questions remain open.
One of the most controversial issues refers to the position
of Patellogastropoda. Morphological studies consistently
place patellogastropods as the sister taxon to the rest of
gastropods [25,26,28,42,54]. However, Colgan et al. 2003
[34] proposed a reevaluation of the morphological characters defining Patellogastropoda and its relationships
with other gastropods. The morphological dataset was
updated with new data about buccal cartilages and the
fine structure of the cephalic tentacles, and the validity of
previous polarization of some characters like the absence
of the hypobranchial gland or the flexoglosste condition
of the radula was questioned [34]. Morevover, molecular
studies produced conflicting results, recovering unstable
positions for Patellogastropoda [30,34]. In our phylogenetic analyses, L. digitalis is recovered as the sister group to
Heterobranchia with statistical support when trees are
rooted with both cephalopods and polyplacophorans (a
sister group relationship between Eogastropoda and
Orthogastropoda was rejected by the AU and KH (but not
SH) tests; Table 2). The mt genome of L. digitalis exhibits
a unique mt gene order, and in the phylogenetic analyses,
this taxon has a long branch compared to that of other
gastropods. A number of studies have suggested that
nucleotide substitution and gene rearrangement rates may
be correlated in mitochondrial genomes (see [55] and references therein). This may be the case in L. digitalis, and
long-branch attraction phenomena could likely be biasing the inference of the phylogenetic position of this species, particularly taking into account that any outgroup
taxa that could be included in the phylogenetic analyses
are all distantly related to gastropods. The complete mt
genomes of more representatives of Patellogastropoda
need to be analyzed in order to resolve the phylogenetic
position of Patellogastropoda and to discern among competing hypotheses.
Previous morphological and molecular studies based on
nuclear markers recovered Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia as sister taxa, conforming the Apogastropoda
[26,28,31,35,56]. However, all the analyses performed in
this study support a strikingly close relationship between
Vetigastropoda and Caenogastropoda. The AU and KH

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/61

(but not SH) tests consistently rejected the validity of
Apogastropoda (Table 2). Morphological synapomorphies described for Apogastropoda should be revisited
taking into account our results, and perhaps new synapomorphies for Vetigastropoda and Caenogastropoda may
be found.
The monophyly of Heterobranchia is well supported by
several morphological synapomorphies like the presence
of pigmented mantle organs, longitudinal rows of cilia in
the mantle cavity, a chalaze in the egg masses, heterostrophy, and simultaneous hermaphroditism [57]. Phylogenetic analyses based on mt genome sequence data support
the monophyly of heterobranchs (Fig. 3). However, the
monophyly and phylogenetic relationships between the
different groups included within Heterobranchia (i.e.
Heterostropha and Euthyneura (Pulmonata and Opisthobranchia)) have been the subject of controversy for many
years [25,26,58-60]. Heterostropha was defined as a paraphyletic group including species with typically ancestral
and derived characters mixed together in the same forms
[26,28,36]. The unique representative of Heterostropha
included in this study (P. dolabrata) belongs to Pyramidelloidea, a group of gastropods that has been excluded of
Heterobranchia by some authors [23,25,61], placed as a
basal heterobranch with respect to Euthyneura [58], or
included in Opisthobranchia by others [39,62-65]
depending on the characters considered. All our analyses
recover P. dolabrata as closely related to systelommatophoran pulmonates and opisthobranchs, and confirm our
previous studies [37].
Pulmonata includes marine, freshwater and terrestrial gastropods with very different body plans. The monophyly of
Pulmonata has been accepted by many authors based on
some morphological characters like the streptoneuran
inervation of the cephalic tentacles, and the lack of rhinophoric nerve (present in opisthobranchs and pyramidellids). However, the essential, traditionally accepted
morphological synapomorphy of Pulmonata is the presence of a special neurosecretory system comprising
procerebrum and cerebral gland [26,66-68]. The procerebrum is formed of small and large neuronal cells, and
because it links the peripheral tentacular structures with
the central nervous system, an olfactory function has been
assumed. The cerebral gland is a neuronal structure associated with the cerebral ganglia. New molecular data reject
Pulmonata as a natural group based on both nuclear and
mitochondrial data [32,37,45]. In this study, we have
included representatives of all major lineages within pulmonates (Systelommatophora, Basommatophora, Ellobiidae, and Stylommatophora). All these lineages
independently reject the definition of pulmonates as a
natural group in all the performed analyses (Fig. 3; Table
2). Stylommatophora (land snails) is a monophyletic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/61

group, in agreement with previous morphological studies
[69], and it is recovered as the sister group to all other heterobranchs studied (Fig. 3). Our results provide new
insights into land colonization by heterobranch gastropods. The transition to a land lifestyle was accompanied
by a variety of refined morphological and physiological
modifications. As a result, land snails and slugs constitute
a well-defined group of pulmonates with several morphological synapomorphies in the cephalic tentacles, kidney,
and central nervous system, as well as in several aspects of
their ontogeny. Previous phylogenetic hypotheses had
suggested that the transition to land was a rather derived
event in the history of pulmonates. Our molecular phylogeny instead supports a different scenario in which gastropod land colonization, and subsequent radiation was
an early and significant event in the evolution of Heterobranchia.

Mitochondrial genome rearrangements during the
evolution of Gastropoda
Gene order rearrangements in mt genomes are relatively
rare, and if shared derived by two taxa can be considered
molecular synapomorphies and may provide useful data
for phylogenetic reconstruction. In this study, we have
mapped gene orders of gastropod mt genomes onto the
gastropod phylogeny and tentatively reconstructed the
evolutionary history of mt gene order rearrangements in
gastropods. The Vetigastropoda H. rubra and the cephalopod O. vulgaris have the same gene order (with only three
changes in trnC, trnD and trnN) suggesting that H. rubra
may retain the ancestral mt gene order of Gastropoda. The
relative placement of trnD and trnN in H. rubra might constitute autapomorphies in this species since these two
tRNAs show the same location in Caenogastropoda and
the cephalopod O. vulgaris.

The marine Basommatophora S. pectinata is more closely
related to opisthobranchs than to the freshwater basommatophoran B. glabrata or to any other group of pulmonates considered in this study (Fig. 3). The phylogenetic
affinities of S. pectinata have been under debate for many
years (see discussion in [37]). All new data and analyses
presented here support S. pectinata as an opisthobranch.
To test the monophyly of freshwater basommatophorans,
mt genome sequence data of more representatives of this
group should be included in future analyses.

Considering all the data available so far, three major rearrangements have taken place in the evolutionary history
of gastropods: one in the ancestor of Caenogastropoda,
another in the ancestor of Patellogastropoda, and another
one in the ancestor of Heterobranchia.

The monophyly of pulmonates is also rejected by the location of a representative of Systelommatophora (O. celtica)
as an independent linage more closely related to P. dolabrata and to opisthobranchs than to any other Pulmonate
(Fig. 3), which corroborates previous morphological
hypotheses [58,70].
The robust results described in this study provide new
insights on the systematics of gastropods. The majority of
our evolutionary hypotheses are in agreement with traditional morphological hypotheses although there are some
cases of strong discrepancy (i.e. the phylogenetic position
of Patellogastopoda, the sister group relationship between
Vetigastropoda and Caenogastropoda, and the polyphyly
of Pulmonata). Among these results, the polyphyly of pulmonates is perhaps the most remarkable, and warns
against only relying on one or few morphological characters (even if they seem to be free of convergent evolution)
to define deep phylogenetic relationships. In any case, the
results here presented should be interpreted as a working
phylogenetic hypothesis, which needs to be further confirmed with a larger taxon sampling of the studied groups,
and the addition to the phylogenetic analyses of new taxa
representing not previously included major lineages of
gastropods.

The two complete mt genomes of caenogastropods
sequenced so far and the incomplete mt genome of the
caenogastropod L. saxatilis have identical gene arrangements (data not shown). Two rearrangements (one inversion and one translocation) separate the hypothetical
ancestral state of gastropods from the gene order found in
Caenogastropoda (Fig. 4). Long inversion events rendering new gene order configurations have been already
described for other closely related groups [71].
The mt gene order of L. digitalis is very distinctive compared to those other mollusk mt genomes sequenced so
far. The remarkable number of gene rearrangement events
that need to be invoked to explain the mt gene order of L.
digitalis requires considering special mechanisms such as
intramolecular recombination facilitated by tandem
repeat sequences, as described for other metazoans [72].
Sequencing of other patellogastropodan mt genomes
should determine whether the striking gene order of L.
digitalis is unique to this species or a more general feature
of Patellogastropoda.
The mt gene order of the heterobranchs sequenced so far,
including those of the incomplete mt genomes of the Stylommatophoran E. herklotsi and the Heterostrophan O.
atomus (data not shown), has only few gene boundaries in
common with the hypothetical ancestral mt gene order of
gastropods. Considering all the data available so far, it is
not possible to determine the precise mechanism responsible for rearrangements in this transition (tandem duplication-random loss [73], inversion [71], transposition

Page 11 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:61

[74], and/or intramolecular recombination [72]). The
compact organization of the mt genomes of Heterobranchia (with very few and short non coding sequences)
suggests strong selection against maintaining remnants of
duplication events. However, the trnF-like structure
described in this study, might represent one remnant of a
putative duplication event, and would be in support of
tandem duplication and random loss as a mechanism acting in heterobranch mt genome rearrangements.
The new data presented here suggest that the gene order
among heterobranchs is not as well conserved as previously thought [11,14,17,20,22]. Most part of these mt
genomes shows a rather conserved gene order, being gene
rearrangements concentrated between nad1 and trnE
genes (Fig. 4). Several gene order autapomorphies (not
only in tRNAs but also in protein coding genes) can be
detected in heterobranchs, especially in S. pectinata and P.
dolabrata.
Two additional aspects about gene order in heterobranchs
can be highlighted. First, the gene order trnY-trnW-nad4L
supports the close relationship between opisthobranchs
and S. pectinata. Second, trnY bounds with cox1 gene in
the mt genome of P. dolabrata (instead of trnK gene as in
all other heterobranchs). However, the sequences of the
trnY and K genes in P. dolabrata are nearly identical (Fig.
2), suggesting that two mutation events might have
occurred in the anticodon triplet producing changes in the
identity of these two tRNAs. This event, called tRNA
recruitment, has also been previously described in other
taxa [75].
The phylogenetic inferences based on genome arrangement data rendered inconclusive results. Despite the relatively high number of different gene orders found in
gastropod mt genomes, few of them are shared and
derived, and thus both parsimony and Bayesian inference
arrived at rather unresolved trees. Our results point out
that the comparative study of gene arrangement in gastropods may provide valuable phylogenetic information, but
that current methods of phylogenetic inference based on
gene arrangements still need further development.

Conclusion
According to our results, the validity of Apogastropoda
should be questioned, Pyramidelloidea should be
included within Euthyneura, S. pectinata should be recognized as a member of Opisthobranchia, and Pulmonata
should not be considered a natural group. Our results
stress the need of a thorough re-evaluation of the morphological characters that have been used to analyze relationships within Gastropoda, and in particular those that
supported the monophyly of pulmonates. Although the
number of complete mt genomes is increasing rapidly in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/61

the last years, still more genomic data is needed to further
understand gastropod systematics. The phylogenetic affinities of Neritopsina and Cocculiniformia with respect to
other gastropods, the position of Patellogastropoda
among gastropods, and the delimitation of Heterostropha
and Euthyneura are still open questions that could be
tackle in the future with the approach proposed in this
study. The recovered phylogeny based on complete mt
genome data provides a first instance of robust phylogenetic framework for comparative studies in gastropods,
and will allow a better understanding of evolutionary
trends within this group. In particular, it seems to be quite
useful and promising for determining the rates and mechanisms of gene rearrangement in gastropod mt genomes.

Methods
Taxon sampling
Each of the five gastropod complete mt genomes
sequenced anew in this study was obtained from a single
specimen. A. fragilis was collected in Murcia (southeastern
Iberian Peninsula) and preserved frozen at -20°C. S. pectinata and O. celtica were sampled in Ceuta (northern
Africa) and preserved in EtOH 100%. P. dolabrata was collected in Annobon Island (western Africa) and preserved
in EtOH 100%. M. myosotis was collected in Vigo (northwestern Iberian Peninsula) and preserved frozen at -20°C.
All specimens were sampled between 2000 and 2002.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, cloning and
sequencing
Total cellular DNA was purified following a standard phenol/chloroform extraction [76]. Universal primers were
used to amplify by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments of the mitochondrial cox1 (LCO-1490 and HCO2198, [77]), rrnL (16Sar-L and 16Sbr-H, [78]), and rrnS
(H1478 and L1091, [79]) genes. Standard PCR reactions
containing 67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4
mM of each dNTP, 2.5 μM of each primer, template DNA
(10–100 ng), and Taq DNA polymerase (1 unit, Biotools)
in a final volume of 25 μl were subjected to 30 cycles of
denaturing at 94°C for 60 s, annealing at 42°C for 60 s,
and extending at 72°C for 90 s. The PCR amplified fragments were sequenced with the BigDye Deoxy Terminator
cycle-sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer Biosystems) in an
automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100) using the
PCR primers, and following manufacturer's instructions.

The sequences of these fragments were used to design
three sets of specific primers for each species that amplified, by long PCR, three fragments that covered the
remaining mt genome. Long PCRs containing 60 mM

s, annealing at 52°C for 30 s, and extending at 68°C for 7
min. Long PCR products in some cases and total cellular
DNA extractions in others were used as DNA templates to
amplify by standard PCR reactions (see conditions above)
overlapping fragments that covered the complete mt
genomes. These overlapping PCRs were performed using
degenerated primers (designed based on published mt
genome sequences of gastropods) and/or specific walking
primers for each species. The sequences of all these primers are available from the authors upon request. PCR
products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega),
and sequenced using M13 universal primers in an automated sequencer (see above).
Molecular and Phylogenetic analyses
Gene annotation was performed using BLAST [80] comparisons against published gastropod mtDNAs. Sequence
data were handled with MacClade version 4.05 OSX [81]
and PAUP* version 4.0b10 [82]. Protein coding genes
were recognized by inferring open reading frames (ORFs),
and by delimiting start and stop codons. Cloverleaf secondary structures of all tRNA genes were reconstructed by
hand upon localization of the specific anticodons. The
sequences of the complete mt genomes reported in this
paper have been deposited at the EMBL/GenBank data
libraries under accession numbers AY345054 (P. dolabrata), AY098929 (A. fragilis), AY345049 (S. pectinata),
AY345048 (O. celtica), and AY345053 (M. myosotis).

Phylogenetic analyses included the five newly determined
mtDNA sequences, as well as all gastropod complete mt
genome sequences available in GenBank. In addition, the
corresponding sequences of the cephalopod species Octopus vulgaris, Todarodes pacificus [52], and Loligo bleekeri
[83], and the polyplacophoran Katharina tunicata [84]
were used as outgroups. The deduced amino-acid
sequences of each mt protein-coding gene (except atp8)
were aligned independently using Clustal X version 1.62b
[85] followed by refinement by eye in an effort to maximize positional homology. Ambiguous alignments and
gaps were discarded from further phylogenetic analyses.
The aligned amino acid sequences were concatenated into
a single data set, which was subjected to maximum-parsimony (MP), minimum evolution (ME), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian inference (BI) methods of
phylogenetic reconstruction. MP analyses were performed
with PAUP* using heuristic searches (TBR branch swapping; MulTrees option in effect) with 10 random additions of taxa. ME analyses [86] were carried out with
PAUP* using mean character distances. Robustness of the
resulting MP and ME trees was evaluated with non-parametric bootstrap proportions (BPs, [87]) as implemented
in PAUP* with 1,000 pseudoreplicates. ProtTest version
1.3 [88] was used to estimate the evolutionary model that
best fit the amino-acid data set. The Akaike information

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/61

criterion (AIC) implemented in ProtTest selected the
WAG+I+G [89] evolutionary model. ML analyses using
the WAG+I+G were performed with PHYML version [90],
and robustness of the resulting ML tree was evaluated by
bootstrapping with 500 pseudoreplicates. BI analyses
were performed with MrBayes 3.12 [91] by simulating a
Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) with four simultaneous chains, each of 106 generations (sampled every 100 generations) under the
WAG+I+G model. Trees sampled before the cold chain
reached stationarity (as judged by plots of ML scores) were
discarded as "burn-in". Runs were repeated twice. Robustness of the resulting BI tree was evaluated using Bayesian
posterior probabilities (BPPs). In addition, BI was also
applied to a data set that included the aligned amino acid
sequence of each gene as independent partitions. The AIC
implemented in ProtTest was used to select the substitution models for each gene: atp6 (RtREV+G+F), cox1
(WAG+G+F), cox2 (RtREV+I+G+F), cox3 (cpREV+G+F),
cob
(cpREV+I+G+F),
nad1
(RtREV+G+F),
nad2
(WAG+I+G+F), nad3 (RtREV+G+F), nad4 (WAG+I+G+F),
nad4L (MtREV+G+F), nad5 (RtREV+I+G+F), nad6 (Dayhoff+G+F). This data set was subjected to the same searching parameters for BI described above plus the "set
partition" and "unlink" options.
Alternative phylogenetic hypotheses were tested using the
approximately unbiased (AU), Shimodaira- Hasegawa
(SH), and Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) tests [92] as implemented in CONSEL version 0.1 [93] using default settings. The alternative hypotheses tested were a priori
morphology-based hypotheses.
Phylogenetic relationships among gastropods were also
reconstructed based on genome arrangement data using
parsimony and Bayesian inferences with the GRAPPA [8]
and Badger [94] programs.
