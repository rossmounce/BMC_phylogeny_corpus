Abstract
Background: CTCF is a versatile zinc finger DNA-binding protein that functions as a highly conserved epigenetic
transcriptional regulator. CTCF is known to act as a chromosomal insulator, bind promoter regions, and facilitate
long-range chromatin interactions. In mammals, CTCF is active in the regulatory regions of some genes that exhibit
genomic imprinting, acting as insulator on only one parental allele to facilitate parent-specific expression. In
Drosophila, CTCF acts as a chromatin insulator and is thought to be actively involved in the global organization of
the genome.
Results: To determine whether CTCF regulates imprinting in Drosophila, we generated CTCF mutant alleles and
assayed gene expression from the imprinted Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome in the presence of reduced CTCF
expression. We observed disruption of the maternal imprint when CTCF levels were reduced, but no effect was
observed on the paternal imprint. The effect was restricted to maintenance of the imprint and was specific for the
Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome.
Conclusions: CTCF in Drosophila functions in maintaining parent-specific expression from an imprinted domain as
it does in mammals. We propose that Drosophila CTCF maintains an insulator boundary on the maternal X
chromosome, shielding genes from the imprint-induced silencing that occurs on the paternally inherited X
chromosome.

Background
The correct establishment and propagation of epigenetic
states are essential for normal development, and disruption of these processes leads to disease. Genomic
imprinting is a striking example of the effect of epigenetics on gene regulation. In genomic imprinting, a
mark, the imprint, is imposed on the two parental genomes during gametogenesis. In the zygote, the imprint
is maintained through each mitotic division and results
in the parental alleles of a gene, or entire homologous
chromosomes, adopting different epigenetic states. As a
result of these different epigenetic states, one parental

allele can be silenced while the allele from the other
parent, although identical in DNA sequence, is active.
The CCCTC-binding factor, CTCF, is a key player in
maintaining epigenetically distinct chromatin domains.
CTCF is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger-containing DNA-binding protein that can function both directly
in gene regulation as a transcription factor and also
indirectly by mediating long-range chromatin interactions. In this latter role, CTCF acts as a chromatin insulator by isolating enhancer and promoter regulatory
units and as a barrier to the spread of heterochromatin
[1]. CTCF binds at multiple sites throughout the genome [2-4], indicating a widespread role in generating
chromatin domains. Epigenetic isolation is necessary for
correct maintenance of genomic imprints as imprinted
domains are often interspersed among nonimprinted
domains [5,6], necessitating their isolation from flanking

regulatory regions. Additionally, the two homologous
alleles must be isolated as differential gene expression
patterns, chromatin conformations, and replication timing have all been associated with imprinted alleles [7].
CTCF binding has been reported at multiple mammalian imprinted domains [5], illustrating the importance
of insulator function in maintaining parent-specific
expression. The role of CTCF in imprinting has been
best characterized for the mammalian Igf2/H19 genes, in
which only the maternal H19 allele and paternal Igf2
alleles are expressed [8-10]. On the maternal chromosome, CTCF binds to a differentially methylated domain
(DMD) located between the Igf2 and H19 genes, preventing interaction of downstream enhancer sequences
with the promoter of Igf2, effectively silencing the gene.
Methylation of the paternal DMD effectively blocks
CTCF binding, allowing activation of Igf2 expression
while also initiating the silencing of the H19 gene. Binding of CTCF is necessary to maintain the epigenetic
state of the imprinted alleles. Consequently, if the CTCF
binding site in the Igf2/H19 DMD is mutated, the
monoallelic expression arising from the imprint is lost
[11,12]. An additional facet of CTCF binding appears to
be the facilitation of higher-order chromatin structures
through DNA looping, a property which fortifies the
silencing of Igf2 and the activation of H19 on the maternal chromosome [13,14]. The details of CTCF binding
and its consequences are less well studied at other
imprinted loci; however, its insulator function and role
in establishing higher-order chromatin function appear
to be shared features of other mammalian imprinted
loci which bind CTCF [5,15-17]. The KvDMR1
imprinted domain, which contains two CTCF binding
sites, regulates the tissue-specific expression of the gene
Cdkn1c. It has been suggested that the tissue-specific
imprinting of Cdkn1c is due to tissue-specific binding of
CTCF to the KvDMR1 imprint domain [18,19]. The
imprinted domain Wsb1/Nf1 also requires CTCFmediated interchromosomal association with the Igf2/
H19 imprinted domain for proper parent-specific
expression [20].
Although CTCF appears to be the major insulator
protein in vertebrates, the more compact Drosophila
genome uses a variety of insulator proteins, among
which is the Drosophila CTCF homolog dCTCF [21-23].
The insulator activity of dCTCF has been well characterized in the bithorax complex, where it demarcates the
chromatin domains that define separate regulatory
regions [22,24,25], and, as in mammals, dCTCF is widely
used as an insulator throughout the Drosophila genome
and also acts directly as a transcription factor [26-28].
Though the role of CTCF in the formation of distinct
chromatin domains is conserved from Drosophila to
mammals, the roles of CTCF in epigenetic processes

such as genomic imprinting have been assumed to differ
[1]. To assess the effect of dCTCF on Drosophila
imprinting, we used a well-characterized imprinting
assay system, the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome, in
which a readily visible eye color gene, garnet (g), is juxtaposed to an imprint control region and so becomes a
marker for imprinting [29]. Regulation of the Dp(1;f)LJ9
imprint previously has been shown to share properties
of mammalian imprinting, including transcriptional
silencing of gene clusters and differential chromatin
states between homologues [30-32]. Here we present the
first demonstration that dCTCF has a role in the regulation of genomic imprinting in Drosophila. As is the case
in mammalian imprinting, dCTCF in Drosophila is
involved in the regulation of the maternal imprint by
maintaining parent-specific expression from the maternally inherited X chromosome.

Results
Characterization of CTCF alleles

The CTCFEY15833 allele (FBrf0132177) was produced by
insertion of the P{EPgy2} element into the +26 position
relative to the transcription start site of the dCTCF gene
by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP)
Gene Disruption Project [33]. Homozygous CTCFEY15833
adults appear healthy and are reasonably fertile. CTCF30,
created by a partial deletion of the P{EPgy2} element, is
homozygous lethal. CTCF30 lacks the entire 5′ end of the
P{EPgy2} element but retains 4860 bp of the 3′ end.
Flanking dCTCF sequences and the quemao (qm) gene
remain intact in CTCF 30 . The reduced severity of
CTCFEY15833, with an intact P{EPgy2} element, suggests
that a promoter in the 5′ end of P{EPgy2} may partially
rescue dCTCF expression. To test this idea, we measured
the dCTCF transcript levels by quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) of third instar larvae. Expression in
homozygous CTCFEY15833 larvae is 20% ± 4% of that in
wild-type (y w) controls. This is consistent with previous
studies showing that CTCFEY15833 homozygotes produce
~50% of wild-type dCTCF protein levels [22]. Homozygous CTCF 30 larvae cannot be recovered in sufficient
numbers for qRT-PCR, but heterozygous CTCF 30 /+
larvae display 68 ± 9% of wild-type transcript levels, consistent with a severe reduction in expression by this
mutation. Taken together, the phenotypic and expression
analysis of dCTCF alleles indicates that both CTCFEY15833
and CTCF30 alleles have reduced dCTCF expression and
that the 5′ end of P{EPgy2} may drive sufficient expression to allow recovery of CTCFEY15833 adults.
Drosophila CTCF maintains the maternal imprint of the
garnet gene on the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome

To test the effect of the dCTCF alleles on Drosophila
imprinting, we used the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome.

Maternal inheritance of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosomes (Dp(1;f)LJ9MAT) generate full expression of the
marker gene garnet, whereas paternal inheritance (Dp(1;
f)LJ9PAT) generates variegated garnet expression (Figures
1a and 1b, control). The variegated garnet gene phenotype arising from paternal transmission is mitotically
stable and so results in distinct clonal regions exhibiting
garnet expression in an eye devoid of garnet expression.
Expression of garnet affects both red (pteridine) and
brown (ommochrome) eye pigments, which makes this
mini-X chromosome an easily assayed system in which
to assess the effect of dCTCF alleles on imprinting in
Drosophila.
Transmission of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome
through the female results in y1 z a g 53d/Dp(1;f)LJ9; +/+
mini-X chromosome-bearing male progeny with essentially wild-type expression of the garnet imprint marker
gene. Eyes are phenotypically wild type, with 85.3 ±
1.4% wild-type red pigment levels and 85.7 ± 3.4% wildtype brown pigment levels (Figure 1a, control). To
determine the effects of dCTCF on the maternal

maintenance of imprinted garnet expression, the CTCFX
alleles (X represents CTCF 30 or CTCF EY15833 ) were
crossed to females with the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome: y1zag53d/Y; CTCFX/TM3, Sb Ser males x X^X/Dp
(1;f)LJ9 females. This cross-generated progeny with a
mutant dCTCF allele and a maternally imprinted miniX chromosome (y 1 z a g 53d /Dp(1;f)LJ9 MAT ; CTCF X /+),
which were compared with progeny similarly carrying a
maternally imprinted chromosome, but wild type for
dCTCF.
For each dCTCF allele tested, the mutant allele substantially reduced expression of the maternally transmitted imprint marker gene (Figure 1a). Progeny with a
maternally inherited mini-X chromosome (Dp(1;f)
LJ9 MAT ) with CTCF EY15833 reduced pigment levels to
67.2 ± 3.1% (P < 0.001) and 68.4 ± 4.2% (P < 0.001) for
red and brown pigments, respectively. Dp(1;f)LJ9 MAT
progeny coupled with CTCF 30 resulted in an even
greater reduction of pigment levels: 58.9 ± 3.1%
(P < 0.001) and 56.9 ± 4.7% (P < 0.001) for red and
brown pigments, respectively. No variegated garnet

(y1zag53d/Dp(1;f)LJ9; CTCFEY15833/+ and y1zag53d/Dp(1;f)LJ9; CTCF30/+) disrupt maintenance of the maternal imprint, causing variegated garnet gene

expression was observed in flies with Dp(1;f)LJ9MAT and
wild type for dCTCF (Figures 2a and 2b). However,
when Dp(1;f)LJ9 MAT was inherited along with mutant
dCTCF alleles, variegated garnet expression was
observed (Figures 2a and 2b). These results demonstrate
that the maintenance of the maternal imprint is highly
sensitive to dCTCF dosage.
This cross also produced sibling progeny that have a
maternally inherited Dp(1;f)LJ9 MAT , but with the balancer chromosome, and so wild type for dCTCF
(described in “Methods,” genotype: y 1 z a g 53d /Dp(1;f)

LJ9MAT ; TM3, Sb Ser /+). These internal control flies
are genotypically identical to the external controls but
have the male parent mutant for CTCFX and so would
allow detection of any paternal effect. None was
detected (Figures 3a and 3b).
Drosophila CTCF does not regulate the paternal imprint
of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome

Variegated silencing of garnet from the paternally inherited Dp(1;f)LJ9PAT is a consequence of the spreading of
heterochromatin from the imprinted region [29,32]. In

contrast to the effects observed when the Dp(1;f)LJ9 is
maternally imprinted, dCTCF mutants had no effect on
the paternal expression of the garnet imprint marker
gene. Paternal inheritance of the mini-X chromosome
(X^Y/Dp(1;f)LJ9 males crossed to y1zag53d/y1zag53d; TM3,
Sb Ser/+ females) results in y1zag53d/Dp(1;f)LJ9PAT; +/+
progeny with variegated garnet expression and a marked
reduction in eye pigment levels (35.5 ± 1.5% red and
52.5 ± 0.2% brown wild-type pigment levels; Figure 1b,
control). The introduction of dCTCF mutant alleles
(y1zag53d/y1zag53d; CTCFX/TM3, Sb Ser females to X^Y/
Dp(1;f)LJ9 males) to generate progeny with either
mutant CTCFEY15833 or CTCF30 alleles and a paternally
imprinted Dp(1;f)LJ9PAT mini-X chromosome (y1zag53d/
Dp(1;f)LJ9; CTCFX/+), yielded no significant change in
either red or brown eye pigment levels or phenotype
(Figures 1b and 2c).
Sibling progeny with a paternally inherited Dp(1;f)
LJ9PAT along with the balancer chromosome are wild
type for dCTCF (described in “Methods,” genotype:
y1zag53d/Dp(1;f)LJ9; TM3, Sb Ser/+) and can be used to
determine whether there is a maternal effect from
mothers mutant for CTCF X . No maternal effect was
detected; progeny wild type for dCTCF from mothers
with either CTCFEY15833 or CTCF30 showed no significant change in garnet expression levels (Figures 3c
and 3d).
Drosophila CTCF does not regulate the establishment of
the maternal or paternal imprint of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X
chromosome

To determine whether the effect of dCTCF was on the
somatic maintenance of the imprint or its establishment
in the germline of the parents, we examined the phenotype of progeny from male or female parents with both
the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome and a mutant
CTCF30 allele. If dCTCF affects the establishment of the
imprint, the imprint should be disrupted in the progeny
of mutant CTCF30 parents, but not wild-type (CTCF+)
parents. When we compared the phenotype of progeny
wild type for dCTCF but differing in their parental genotype, no significant alternation in garnet expression
levels resulted between Dp(1;f)LJ9 MAT progeny from
mothers carrying CTCF30 (Figure 4a; Mat-Est. CTCF30)
and either of the external or internal controls wild type
for dCTCF (Figure 4a; Ex. Control and Mat-Est. CTCF+,
respectively). This was reflected in the unchanged phenotype of progeny from mothers mutant or wild type
for dCTCF (Figure 4b; Mat-Est. CTCF 30 and Mat-Est.
CTCF+, respectively). Likewise, mutant dCTCF did not
effect the establishment of the paternal imprint. Dp(1;f)
LJ9 PAT progeny from fathers carrying Dp(1;f)LJ9 and
CTCF30 (Figure 4c; Pat-Est. CTCF30) had no significant
change in garnet expression compared with either the

Page 6 of 14

external or internal controls (Figure 4c; Ex. Control and
Pat-Est. CTCF+, respectively). Again, these Dp(1;f)LJ9PAT
progeny also had no observable change in phenotype
between fathers mutant or wild type for dCTCF (Figure
4d; Pat-Est. CTCF30 and Pat-Est. CTCF+, respectively).
These findings distinguish the function of dCTCF in the
maintenance versus the establishment of the imprint on
the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome; dCTCF is involved
in the maintenance of the imprint in the soma of progeny as its reduction disrupts the maternal imprint.
However, dCTCF is not involved in the establishment of
the imprint as the presence of mutant CTCF30 in either
the maternal or paternal germline during establishment
of the imprint does not affect regulation of the imprint.
Drosophila CTCF is not a general modifier of positioneffect variegation

To determine the effect of dCTCF mutant alleles on the
Dp(1;f)LJ9MAT imprint, we tested the effect of CTCF30
on In(1)wm4, a classical variegating rearrangement [34],
and two fourth chromosome transgenic constructs [35]
in which the white (w) gene is variegated. Like the Dp(1;
f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome, the variegated silencing in In
(1)wm4 is induced by the centric heterochromatin of the
X chromosome [35] and the fourth chromosome has
been proposed to be evolutionarily related to the X
chromosome [36]. We found that the CTCF 30 allele
decreased silencing of white in In(1)w m4 ;CTCF 30 /+
females while having no significant effect on white
expression levels in In(1)wm4;CTCF30/+ males compared
with sibling In(1)wm4;Tb/+ controls (Figure 5a). Similarly, the 6-M193 strain responded to CTCF 30 with a
modest decrease in white reporter silencing in females
only (Figure 5b), whereas the 39C-33 strain showed no
significant change in white reporter silencing from
CTCF 30 (Figure 5c). These results demonstrate that
CTCF30 is not a ubiquitous modifier of variegated heterochromatic silencing in Drosophila, consistent with
the absence of an effect on silencing of the paternally
inherited Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome. Furthermore,
the decreased silencing of the nonimprinted variegators
is opposite to the effect of CTCF 30 on Dp(1;f)LJ9 MAT
silencing. Thus, the role of dCTCF in the maintenance
of the maternal Dp(1;f)LJ9 imprint represents a distinct
parent-specific function for dCTCF on the imprinted Dp
(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome.

Discussion
CTCF is essential for insulator function in vertebrates,
where it plays an active role in regulating imprinted
gene expression. In Drosophila, dCTCF has likewise
been shown to be involved in the insulator function of
boundary elements [28,37]. Our results show that
parent-specific expression from an imprinted domain in

Figure 4 dCTCF does not affect establishment of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 imprint. All genotypes tested are y1zag53d/Dp(1;f)LJ9; +/+ but differ in
parental genotype. External control progeny (Ex. Control) are generated from parents carrying Dp(1;f)LJ9 that have never been exposed to a
mutant dCTCF allele. Progeny generated from a parent carrying both the imprinted Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome and a mutant dCTCF allele
test for effects on imprint establishment (Mat or Pat-Est. CTCF30), whereas parental siblings carrying Dp(1;f)LJ9 and wild type for CTCF serve as an
internal control (Mat or Pat-Est. CTCF+). (a) Maternal establishment of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 imprint is not affected by CTCF30. No significant change in
red pigment levels was detected between external control progeny (Ex. Control; n = 23), mothers carrying Dp(1;f)LJ9MAT, and CTCF30 (Mat-Est.
CTCF30; n = 10), and mothers carrying Dp(1;f)LJ9MAT and CTCF+ (Mat-Est. CTCF+; n = 10). (b) No phenotypic difference is present between
progeny generated from Dp(1;f)LJ9 carrying mothers, either mutant (Mat-Est. CTCF30) or wild type (Mat-Est. CTCF+), for CTCF. (c) Paternal
establishment of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 imprint is not affected by CTCF30. No significant change in red pigment levels was detected between external
control (Ex. Control; n = 44), fathers carrying Dp(1;f)LJ9PAT and CTCF30 (Pat-Est. CTCF30; n = 18), and fathers carrying Dp(1;f)LJ9PAT and CTCF+ (PatEst. CTCF+; n = 29). (d) No phenotypic difference is present between progeny generated from Dp(1;f)LJ9 carrying fathers, either mutant (Pat-Est.
CTCF30) or wild type (Pat-Est. CTCF+) for dCTCF.

Drosophila is dependent on dCTCF function. Maintenance of expression from maternally inherited Dp(1;f)
LJ9 mini-X chromosome is highly sensitive to dCTCF;
even a modest decrease in dCTCF mRNA alters the
maternal imprint so that it resembles the paternal
imprint.
The effect of dCTCF on maternal-specific expression
is limited to the maintenance of imprint. The presence
of mutant dCTCF in either the maternal or paternal
parents, when the imprint is being established, does not
affect the imprint in the progeny. These results are
strikingly similar to the role of CTCF in mammalian
imprinting, where CTCF assists in the postfertilization
formation of an imprinted region, but is dispensable for
the establishment of an imprint [11,12,38].
Furthermore, the requirement for dCTCF for maintenance of the maternal Dp(1;f)LJ9 imprint is specific and
does not represent a ubiquitous role for dCTCF in

regulating heterochromatic silencing. Not only is the
paternal Dp(1;f)LJ9 imprint unaffected by mutant
dCTCF, but other variegating Drosophila reporter genes
respond differently to mutant dCTCF. Thus, the association of dCTCF expression with the maintenance of the
maternal Dp(1;f)LJ9 imprint boundary demonstrates a
distinct function for dCTCF in imprinted gene
expression.
In mammals, maternally imprinted regions that bind
CTCF rely critically on this binding to insulate the
imprinted loci and establish distinct chromatin domains.
Our results show that a reduction in dCTCF levels disrupts the maternal imprint boundary on the Drosophila
Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome, and consequently the
marker gene, garnet, is silenced. Variegated silencing of
garnet from Dp(1;f)LJ9PAT inheritance is a consequence
of heterochromatin formation, nucleated from the paternal imprint control region, spreading in cis [29,32]. The

measured for both the maternally (39C-33MAT) and paternally (39C33PAT) inherited fourth chromosome variegator 39C-33. 39C-33
heterozygous for CTCF30 results in no significant change in white
expression when either maternally or paternally inherited. Red
pigment quantification mean values for each group are based on n
= 10 (50 heads total) for 39C-33MAT and 39C-33PAT male and female
progeny, and n = 20 (100 heads total) for 39C-33;+/+ control male
and female progeny. Error bars represent standard deviation.

absence of an effect upon the introduction of dCTCF
mutant alleles to Dp(1;f)LJ9 PAT suggests that dCTCF
binding and boundary function occurs only on the
maternal chromosome. Thus, it is conceivable that a
reduction in dCTCF levels enables the spreading of heterochromatin on the maternal Dp(1;f)LJ9MAT in a manner similar to that of the paternal Dp(1;f)LJ9PAT. This
would suggest that dCTCF defines the boundary of a
distinct maternal-specific imprinted chromatin domain
required to maintain maternal-specific gene expression
on the X chromosome.
The model organism Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
(modENCODE) project provides detailed mapping of
regulatory elements throughout the Drosophila genome
[39]. Large-scale profiling of dCTCF insulator sites from
early embryo modENCODE data reveals several candidate dCTCF insulator sites present proximal to the predicted heterochromatic breakpoint of the Dp(1;f)LJ9
mini-X chromosome. These dCTCF insulator sites,
located between the centric heterochromatic imprinting
center and the imprint marker gene garnet, could
account for the sensitivity of the maternal imprint to
dCTCF expression. If dCTCF were bound only when
the X chromosome was transmitted maternally, mutations to dCTCF would disrupt insulator function and
lead to maternal silencing of the imprint marker gene.
Although such binding remains to be tested, it is similar
to the function of CTCF at mammalian imprinted
regions.
That the structure of CTCF and its role as an insulator, barrier, and transcriptional regulator is conserved
between mammals and insects have been well established [23,27,28]. However, the finding that CTCF maintains its function in regulating the imprinting of diverse
genes in such phylogenetically distinct organisms is
remarkable. CTCF is a versatile DNA binding factor;
subsets of its zinc fingers are adept at binding diverse
DNA sequences, and the rest of the protein is able to
maintain common regulator interactions and insulator
function [40]. This feature may explain how CTCF can
regulate imprinting in organisms as diverse as insects
and mammals, in which the imprinted target sequences
are different.
Previously, the evolutionary origin of imprinting has
been extrapolated from the conservation of imprinting
among specific genes. Such studies have led to the proposal that mammalian imprinting is of relatively recent
origin and restricted to eutherian mammals [41,42].
However, studies showing that the molecular mechanism of imprinting is highly conserved have suggested a
much more ancient origin [7,30,43]. Mammalian imprint
control elements inserted into transgenic Drosophila act
as discrete silencing elements [44,45] and can retain
posttranscriptional silencing mechanisms involving

MacDonald et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:105
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/105

noncoding RNA [46]. Whereas these transgenic imprinting elements lose their parent-specific functions, the
retention of epigenetic silencing mechanisms suggests
an ancient and conserved origin of imprinting mechanisms. Our finding that CTCF has a role in the maintenance of maternal imprints in insects, as it does in
mammals, supports the possibility of evolutionary conservation for both CTCF function and the mechanisms
of genomic imprinting.

Conclusions
CTCF is a multifunctional protein with a conserved role
as a chromosomal insulator in both mammals and Drosophila. To determine whether dCTCF is involved in
imprinted regulation in Drosophila as it is in mammals,
we generated a dCTCF mutant allele with severe reduction in dCTCF expression and tested its effects on the
expression of the imprint marker gene, garnet, on the
Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome. Full garnet gene
expression, which occurs when the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X
chromosome is maternally inherited, was disrupted
when dCTCF expression levels were reduced. No effect
of reduced dCTCF expression was observed on the Dp
(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome when it was inherited
paternally. The effect of dCTCF mutations is on the
maintenance rather than on the establishment of the
imprint, and is specific to the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome. These results demonstrate that dCTCF is
involved in maintaining parent-specific expression from
the maternally inherited X chromosome in Drosophila,
a role paralleling its involvement in mammalian
imprinting.
Methods
Drosophila culture

All crosses were maintained at 22°C and cultured on
standard cornmeal-molasses Drosophila media with
methyl benzoate (0.15%) as a mold inhibitor. Each set of
crosses was performed in 55-ml shell vials and contained 10-15 virgin females and 10-15 males. Each of
the crosses was subcultured three or four times at 3-day
intervals before the parents were discarded. Each cross
was replicated four to six times, and the progeny were
pooled. All stocks were obtained from the Bloomington
Drosophila stock center, with the exception of the
CTCF30 allele and the variegating fourth chromosome
transgene strains. The CTCFEY15833 allele was created by
insertion of P{EPgy2} 27 bp downstream of the dCTCF
transcription start site. The homozygous lethal CTCF30
allele was generated by imprecise excision of
CTCFEY15833. The CTCF30 deletion was characterized by
amplification across the break and sequencing of the
PCR product. CTCF30 is deleted for all 5′ transposon
sequences but retains 4860 bp at the 3′ end. No

Page 9 of 14

genomic sequence was removed by the CTCF30 deletion.
The fourth chromosome variegating strains were generated using the transposable P element P [hsp26-pt,
hsp70-w], which contains the hsp70-driven white gene
that is susceptible to silencing caused by heterochromatin formation [47]. The 6-M193 strain has the construct
inserted within a 1360 transposon and inside the Syt7
gene (fourth chromosome coordinate: 323400), whereas
the 39C-33 strain is generated from the construct being
inserted into gene of the RNA binding protein gawky
(fourth chromosome coordinate: 680211), which is in
close proximity to a 1360 transposon [47].
To determine the effect of mutant dCTCF on imprint
maintenance, the CTCF30 and CTCFEY15833 alleles were
crossed into y1zag53d background to yield stable stocks
of y1zag53d/y1zag53d; CTCFX/TM3, Sb Ser (where CTCFX
is the CTCF30 or CTCFEY15833 allele). To test the effect
of a dCTCF allele on the paternal imprinting of garnet,
Dp(1;f)LJ9, y + g + /X^Y males were crossed to y 1 z a g 53d /
y1zag53d; CTCFX/TM3, Sb Ser females, and the reciprocal
cross with Dp(1;f)LJ9, y+g+/X^X virgin females was performed to test the effect on the maternal imprinting of
garnet (Figure 6). y 1 z a g 53d /Dp(1;f)LJ9; CTCF X /+ male
progeny were collected on the basis of wild-type yellow
(y+) body color, which independently confirms the presence of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 chromosome, whereas the zeste
allele (za) reduces background eye color of the g allele
(g 53d ). The y 1 z a g 53d/Dp(1;f)LJ9; TM3, Sb Ser/+ sibling
males were used as internal controls (Figure 6). The “no
modifier” control test cross for paternal garnet imprinting consisted of Dp(1;f)LJ9, y+g+/X^Y males crossed to
y1zag53d/y1zag53d; TM3, Sb Ser/+ females, with the reciprocal cross serving as the maternal control: y1zag53d/Dp
(1;f)LJ9; +/+ and y 1 z a g 53d /Dp(1;f)LJ9; TM3, Sb Ser/+
male progeny were collected as controls.
To test for the effects of CTCF on germline imprint
establishment, mutant CTCF must be present in parents
carrying the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome. To detect
the effect of CTCF 30 on the establishment of the
imprint, Dp(1;f)LJ9; e/e flies were balanced over X^X;
CTCF30/e for maternal establishment (Figure 7), or X^Y;
CTCF30/e for paternal establishment (Figure 8). X^X/Dp
(1;f)LJ9; CTCF30 /e females were crossed to y 1 z a g53d /Y
males to test maternal imprint establishment (Mat-Est.
CTCF 30 ), and the reciprocal cross tested for paternal
imprint establishment (Pat-Est. CTCF 30 ). Maternal
establishment controls (Mat-Est. CTCF+) consisted of
X^X/Dp(1;f)LJ9; e/e females crossed to y1zag53d/Y males,
and paternal establishment controls (Pat-Est. CTCF +)
were X^Y/Dp(1;f)LJ9; e/e males crossed to y 1 z a g 53d /
y1zag53d females. External controls were also produced
by crossing F1 generation X^X/Dp(1;f)LJ9; e/e females to
y 1 z a g 53d /Y males for maternal establishment, and the
reciprocal cross for paternal establishment.

Figure 7 Mating schematic for testing dCTCF for an effect on maternal establishment of the Dp(1;f)LJ9 imprint. Two primary sets of
progeny and an external control were generated from this cross: progeny with a maternally-inherited Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome from
mothers with the CTCF30 mutation (Mat-Est. CTCF30) and progeny that also have a maternally imprinted Dp(1;f)LJ9 chromosome but from
mothers wild type for CTCF (Mat-Est. CTCF+). External control crosses were produced by crossing F1 generation X^X/Dp(1;f)LJ9; e/e females to
y1zag53d/Y males (not depicted).

To assess the effect of CTCF 30 on other variegating
strains, CTCF30 /TM6, Tb flies were crossed to In(1)wm4
and two variegating fourth chromosome (6-M193 or
39C-33) strains. For the In(1)w m4 crosses, In(1)w m4
females were crossed to w1118/Y; CTCF30 males and the
red pigment levels of the In(1)wm4/Y; CTCF30/+and In
(1)wm4/w1118; CTCF30/+ progeny were compared with
that of their In(1)w m4 ; TM6, Tb siblings. Reciprocal
crosses were performed with the variegating fourth
chromosome strains to control for both the maternal
and paternal inheritance of the variegating transgene.
The maternal cross consisted of w-/w-; +/+; +/+; var/
var females crossed to y/w-; CTCF 30 /TM6, Tb; +/+;

+/+ males, and paternal inheritance used y/w-; +/+; +/+;
var/var males crossed to w-/w-; CTCF 30 /+; +/+; +/+
females, where var represents the variegating fourth
chromosome transgene. The resulting progeny were
separated by sex (y/w-; CTCF30; +/+; var/var males and
w-/w-; CTCF30/+; +/+; var/var females) and compared
with the balancer controls (y/w-; TM6, Tb/+; +/+; var/
var males and w-/w-; TM6, Tb/+; +/+; var/var females).
Measurement of dCTCF expression

qRT-PCR was used to measure dCTCF expression. Total
RNA was prepared from three groups of 50 larvae for
each genotype. One microgram of total RNA was

progeny and an external control were generated from this cross: progeny with a paternally-transmitted Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome from
fathers with the CTCF30 mutation (Pat-Est. CTCF30) and progeny that also have a paternally imprinted Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome but from
fathers wild type for CTCF (Pat-Est. CTCF+). External control crosses were produced by crossing F1 generation X^Y/Dp(1;f)LJ9; e/e males to

reverse transcribed using random hexamers and
ImProm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega). Quantitative
PCR was performed as previously described [48].
dCTCF primers (CTCF F2400, ACGAGGAGGT
GTTGGTCAAG and CTCF R2485, ATCATCG
TCGTCCTCGAAC) were used at 300 nM. Two technical replicates from each sample were amplified. Expression was normalized to Dmn, a gene that has proved
reliable for this purpose [48].
Quantification of eye pigment levels

Expression of the imprint marker gene garnet was quantified both visually and through the use a spectrophotometric assay of extracted eye pigments. The visual assay

assigns each eye a score in relation to its variegation
class as described by Joanis and Lloyd [32]; 0-25% pigmentation, 25-50% pigmentation, 50-75% pigmentation,
and 75-100% pigmentation. The prevalence of each variegation class is expressed as a percentage of all eyes
assayed. As the variegated phenotype of maternally
inherited Dp(1;f)LJ9 in the presence of mutant dCTCF is
skewed toward fully pigmented eyes, a second assay
with the following variegation classes was performed:
>80% pigmentation, 80-90% pigmentation, 90-100% pigmentation, and 100% pigmentation.
The spectrophotometric assay was adapted from Real
et al. [49]. For red (pteridine) pigment, flies of each test
genotype were aged for 4 days and then placed in

MacDonald et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:105
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/105

1.5-ml Eppendorf microtubes and stored at -30°C. For
each sample set, eight heads were placed into a 0.6-ml
microtube containing 400 μl of acidified ethanol (30%
EtOH, acidified to pH 2 with HCl). Pigment was
extracted on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm in the dark
for 48 hours. Absorbance of the extracted pigments was
measured at 480 nm. Each 400-μl sample of extracted
pigment was split into two 200-μl volumes, independently measured, and the values were averaged. Five
tubes were run per sample set, with the values averaged
and expressed as a percentage of wild-type pigment
levels ± standard deviation. For brown (ommochrome)
pigment, flies of each test genotype were aged for 4 days
and then placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf microtubes and
stored at -80°C. Ten heads were placed in a 1.5-ml
Eppendorf tube and homogenized with 150 μl of 2 M
HCl and 0.66% sodium metabisulfite (wt/vol). A total of
200 μl of 1-butanol was added, and the mixture was
placed on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 30 min
before being centrifuged at 9000 g for 5 min. The
organic layer was removed, washed with 150 μl of 0.66%
sodium metabisulfite in dH2O and placed back on the
orbital shaker for a further 30 min, and then this step
was repeated for a second wash. The organic layer was
removed and measured for absorbance at 492 nm. Five
tubes were run per sample set, with the values averaged
and expressed as a percentage of wild-type (O. R) pigment levels ± standard deviation. Absorbance was determined with a Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 2000
spectrophotometer. Representative eye pictures were
photographed with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 mounted on
a Zeiss Stemi 2000-C dissecting microscope.
Spectrophotometric assay for quantifying the expression of the white transgene on the fourth chromosome
variegating strains and In(1)wm4 followed the same procedure for fly aging and head collection. Heads were split
into groups of five and placed into 150 μl of 30% EtOH
acidified to pH 2 with HCl. Pigment extraction consisted
of sonicating samples for 5 seconds at 50 MHz (Sonic
300 Dismembrator Sonicator) prior to soaking samples at
room temperature for 24 hours in the dark. For each
sample, 90 μl of extracted pigment was loaded into 96well microtiter trays and quantified with a Microplate
Reader (Benchmark Bio-Rad) at a wavelength of 480 nm.
The results from each sample group were pooled for a
final mean pigment value. Pigment levels for imprint
establishment were quantified using the same spectrophotometric assay used for quantifying the white variegating strains, except one head was used per sample set.
Statistical Analysis

Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample tests were used to
determine the statistical significance between the visual
eye scores from control and dCTCF mutant data sets.

Page 13 of 14

Statistical significance for both red and brown pigments
was determined by using an ANOVA followed by Student’s t-test with Bonferroni-corrected P values between
the mean of the experimental dCTCF mutant data sets
and the mean of the results from the appropriate control cross.
CTCF modENCODE data

The modENCODE data for dCTCF insulator sites from
0- to 12-hour embryos were obtained from the White
Lab project on the modENCODE web site http://www.
modencode.org[50].
