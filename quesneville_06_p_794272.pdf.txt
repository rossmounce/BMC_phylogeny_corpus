Abstract
Background: Miniature Inverted-repeat Terminal Elements (MITEs), which are particular class-II
transposable elements (TEs), play an important role in genome evolution, because they have very
high copy numbers and display recurrent bursts of transposition. The 5' and 3' subterminal regions
of a given MITE family often show a high sequence similarity with the corresponding regions of an
autonomous Class-II TE family. However, the sustained presence over a prolonged evolutionary
time of MITEs and TE master copies able to promote their mobility has been rarely reported within
the same genome, and this raises fascinating evolutionary questions.
Results: We report here the presence of P transposable elements with related MITE families in
the Anopheles gambiae genome. Using a TE annotation pipeline we have identified and analyzed all
the P sequences in the sequenced A. gambiae PEST strain genome. More than 0.49% of the genome
consists of P elements and derivates. P elements can be divided into 9 different subfamilies,
separated by more than 30% of nucleotide divergence. Seven of them present full length copies.
Ten MITE families are associated with 6 out of the 9 Psubfamilies. Comparing their intra-element
nucleotide diversities and their structures allows us to propose the putative dynamics of their
emergence. In particular, one MITE family which has a hybrid structure, with ends each of which is
related to a different P-subfamily, suggests a new mechanism for their emergence and their mobility.
Conclusion: This work contributes to a greater understanding of the relationship between fulllength class-II TEs and MITEs, in this case P elements and their derivatives in the genome of A.
gambiae. Moreover, it provides the most comprehensive catalogue to date of P-like transposons in
this genome and provides convincing yet indirect evidence that some of the subfamilies have been
recently active.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) were undoubtly closely
involved in the evolution of the genomic sequences we
observe today. TEs can be considered to be parasites, but
they all have genome restructuring capabilities and appear

to play an important part in genome evolution. The availability of the full genome sequence for a given species
now gives us an opportunity to assess the overall impact
of TEs on the sequence structures, dynamics and functions
of DNA.

In a genome, autonomous TE copies coexist with deleted
copies that have frequently been reduced to few hundred
base pairs. Because each of them is a potential player in
genome dynamics, they all need to be accurately located.
Retrotransposons are known to be closely implicated in
genome reshaping [1], but Miniature Inverted-repeat
Transposable Elements (MITEs) could also be implicated,
since they have very high copy numbers and display recurrent bursts of transposition [2,3]. Class II TEs (also known
as DNA TEs) have terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and
transpose via DNA intermediates using a "cut-and-paste"
mechanism. Autonomous elements encode a transposase
that mediates both their own mobility and that of nonautonomous elements that have retained their TIRs. It has
been proposed that MITEs could be a particular type of
defective class II element [4]. They are known to be small
in size, to have short terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), to
be present at a high copy numbers, to tend to be inserted
near to genes, and to have a high intra-family DNA
sequence identity. Moreover, the 5' and 3' subterminal
regions of a given MITE family very often show a high
degree of sequence similarity with the corresponding
regions of a Class II transposable element family [5]. Several such relationships between MITE families and TEs
have been reported in monocotyledons and dicotyledons
: between the Hikkoshi MITE and the OsHikkoshi TE [6],
the stowaway MITE and TC1/mariner TEs [7], and between
the Tourist MITE and PIF/Harbinger TEs [8]. In Xenopus [9]
and mosquitoes [10] such a relationship has been proposed to exist between hAT transposons and several MITE
families on the basis of similarities betweenTIRs and
between target site duplications (TSD). It is now becoming evident that MITEs are non-autonomous DNA elements that originated from DNA transposons which can
still mobilize them. It has been shown recently that active
transposons can mobilize MITEs. In rice, the Pong and
Ping TE families can mobilize mPing MITEs [11]. However, the presence of MITEs and TE master copies able to
promote their mobility over a prolonged evolutionary
time in the same genome seems to be rare, and has been
only reported by Feschotte et al [8,12,13]. This is to be
expected, since the proliferation of non-autonomous elements would lead to the extinction of the related autonomous elements as a result of a regulation by titration of
active amplification, and the selective pressure for MITE
immobility [5].
In this paper, we report the presence of P transposable elements and related MITE families over a prolonged evolutionary time in the Anopheles gambiae genome. The P
element is an active DNA TE that was first isolated from D.
melanogaster [14] then from Scaptomyza palida [15].
Related P transposons have now been reported in the
genomes of numerous dipteran species [16,17] and in
those of several vertebrates; including humans, birds, fish

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/214

and the prochordean Ciona intestinalis [18,19]. Previous
work [20,21] has partially described several distant P element families in A. gambiae. Using a TE annotation pipeline consisting of several programs dedicated to the
identification of repeated sequences, we have identified
all the P sequences in the sequenced A. gambiae PEST
strain genome. Interestingly, an in silico analysis revealed
10 MITE families associated with 6 out of the 9 P subfamilies. Surprisingly, one MITE family whose hybrid
structure has ends each of which is related to a different Psubfamily, suggests a possible new mechanism for their
emergence and their mobility. Comparison of their intranucleotide diversities and their structures allows us to propose the putative dynamics of their emergence. A Southern blot and PCR analysis showed that these P sequences
and their related MITEs are present in five distinct laboratory colonies and seem to have been mobile at least in the
recent past.

Results
Characterization of nine P subfamilies and their master
copies
A thorough mining of the PEST genome by the BLASTX
program using known P transposases identified in Drosophilidae genomes allowed us to identify P sequences
belonging to the various Psubfamilies previously reported
by Sarkar et al. [20] and Oliviera de Carvalho et al. [21].
These authors classified the Anopheles P elements into 15
clades (P1-P15) using the full length (P1, P2, and P3) and
partially homologous P sequences. For each clade we have
annotated the P canonical element, the TIRs and the coding sequence by their similarity to known P transposases
(Table 1). Note that clades P5, P7, P9 and P10 have been
found in other Anopheles species than gambiae, so they
have not been reported in this study. For the sake of consistency in the A. gambiae P sequence identifiers, subfamily names correspond to those of the corresponding
homologous sequences (even if only partially homologous) used in the phylogenic tree published by Sarkar et
al. [20] in which each clade characterizes a subfamily. The
name is followed by "-ref" to indicate that this sequence is
the canonical one We were not been able to identify any
autonomous P sequences with terminal inverted repeats
and coding capabilities for the P1 and P6 subfamilies. For
seven subfamilies, we identified autonomous elements
ranging in size from 4178 bp (AgaP13-ref) to 7545 bp
(AgaP4-ref) (Table 1). TIRs range from 27 to 31 bp in
length. Clades P2, P8, P12, P13 and P15 have quite perfect
TIRs (less than 2 mismatches), and clades P3 and P4 display 8 and 6 mismatches respectively. They are all flanked
by perfect target site duplications 8 bp in length, as in D.
melanogaster P elements.

We have shown previously that all the known P proteins
contain a specific DNA Binding Domain in their NH2 ter-

Framesearch program of the GCG software package [22]
to search the anopheline P sequences, for this domain,
and found a well conserved THAP domain in all putative
Anopheles P transposases. This finding implies that a correction is called for to the putative protein gene structure
of the AgaP2 and AgaP3 elements described by Sarkar et al.
[20] and reported as P3_AG and P1_AG respectively in the
REPBASE UPDATE database [23].

Figure 1 shows the common canonical structure of the P
element families of A.gambiae. The full length elements all
have a coding sequence with three putative exons, except
for AgaP3-ref, which has an additional putative intron
inside exon 2. The following reference elements AgaP2ref, AgaP3-ref, and AgaP12-ref encode a protein consisting
of 879, 895 and 876 amino-acids respectively. The others
have stop codons and frame shifts, but all appear to have
the ability to encode a transposase when corrected for
frame shifts (Fig. 1). All the putative proteins have the
characteristic features of P transposases: (i) a THAP
domain, (ii) a helix-turn-helix motif and (iii) a leucin-zippers motif. If these P subfamilies are mobile, we expect
that a significant fraction of P-containing loci should be

polymorphic among geographical distant populations.
First, we tested the PEST, KISUMU, Mbita, Yaounde and
VK-per laboratory colonies by Southern blots. These laboratory colonies were probed using an internal part of
AgaP2-ref, AgaP3-ref, AgaP4-ref, AgaP12-ref and AgaP15ref copies (Fig. 2a). The restriction digests chosen released
a large internal fragment (excepted for AgaP15, see Fig.
2a) that overlapped the coding regions of the copies under
test. Each subfamily was present in several copies in all the
samples tested; the number of bands is quite similar. In all
cases, the expected restriction fragment was detected, suggesting that these colonies probably contain P coding elements. The polymorphisms in the banding patterns of the
various colonies differed significantly, but their loads in P
sequences all seemed to be roughly identical (except for
the AgaP2 and AgaP12 subfamilies in the Mbita colony).
Consequently, the PEST line can be considered as representative of the Anopheles gambiae species with regard to
the P element subfamilies content in spite of its composite
origin (see Discussion section). Since the band polymorphism on its own is not convincing evidence of the current mobility of TEs (or even of recent mobility), we
performed PCR experiments to detect insertion site polymorphism for 15 P element-containing loci (6 sites for
AgaP2, and 3 for AgaP4, AgaP12, and AgaP15) chosen on
the PEST sequence. Their presence was checked in DNA
samples extracted from the three colonies under test (KISUMU, Yaounde, VK-per) and in the PEST DNA as control.
For each insertion, three primers were designed, one specific to the P element and two derived from the sequences
surrounding the P element. An orthologous site gives different PCR amplified fragments when visualized on an
agarose gel, depending on whether a P copy is present. An
example of the results is given [see Additional file 1]. All
the loci were empty in the tested colonies, apart from one
corresponding to a copy of AgaP15 which also appears to
be occupied in the VK-per sample. These findings suggest
that these P subfamilies were recently mobile.

ies, many hits limited to the same first or last 100 nucleotides, for 6 out of the 7 P subfamilies as previously
described with TIRs. We searched in the neighborhood of
the hits, and found that in many cases there was (i) a
sequence similar to the reverse complement of the
genomic sequence identified by the hit (a putative TIR),
and (ii) a TSD of 8 bp at the boundaries of these putative
TIRs. Using this analysis, we identified copies with two
TIRs, the 5' and 3' parts of a related P element, and an
internal sequence not similar to any P. This structure suggests that they correspond to a new MITE family that we
have called P-MITEs. To test this hypothesis, we then
searched with BLAST in order to find out whether they are
repeated in entirety since if they are, this could be considered to be a genuine P-MITE family. For each P-MITE family, the set of hits were multialigned using ClustalW to
deduce a consensus sequence. Each of the six consensus
sequences has TIRs, P-element 5' and 3' sequences, and a
central region not related to any P sequence (Fig. 3). A

search in the PEST genome with these MITE consensuses
using the TE annotation pipeline identifies numerous fulllength copies that are flanked by an 8 bp perfect target site
duplication (TSD) characteristic of the P element family.
Moreover, the multiple alignments of P-MITE copies each
related to one of the P subfamilies AgaP4, AgaP12 and
AgaP13, display two or three subgroups of sequences,
each of them corresponding to a distinct MITE subfamily
(Fig. 3). Interestingly, we found a composite MITE,
AgaP2-P12MITE, that has originated from two P subfamilies: the 5'end is related to AgaP2, while the 3' end is
related to AgaP12 (Fig. 3).
In summary, we identified 10 P-MITE families that we call
according to the related autonomous P subfamily: AgaP2P12MITE, AgaP4MITE, AgaP8MITE, AgaP12MITE,
AgaP13MITE, AgaP15MITE. Two of them contain 2 subfamilies: (i) AgaP4MITE presents the subfamilies 559 and

sizes in this family, here is the size of the consensus sequence.

675, (ii) AgaP12MITE presents the subfamilies 205A and
205B, and the AgaP13MITE contains 3 subfamilies 259,
412 and 592. All the MITE families share from 114 to 198
bp with their relative P autonomous subfamily (the 5' and
3' homologous regions joined), and show identities varying from 52% to 84.2% in these regions (Fig. 3). Conversely, there is no significant identity in the internal
regions within either the P subfamilies or the P-MITE families. This analysis allows us to describe for the first time
MITEs derived from P transposable elements. The P-MITE

families copy numbers range from 5 to 310, and their size
ranges from 205bp to 2450 bp. Together they constitute
up to 0.36% of the genome sequence. In order to evaluate
MITE distribution within various colonies, we used two
probes corresponding to AgaP12MITE205B and
AgaP15MITE617, to re-hybridize the Southern blot filter
previously probed with the P autonomous subfamilies
(Fig. 2b). The strong signals associated with these two
probes demonstrate their abundance in the five colonies
tested. In what follows, we shall call P-master the related

P autonomous subfamily of a P-MITE family, because it is
thought to provide the transposase responsible for its
mobility.
Genome wide copy distributions
We searched for the P and P-MITEs genomic copies by
annotating the A. gambiae genomic sequences with our TE
annotation pipeline (see Method). In order to increase the
sensitivity of our detection, we used as the P element and
P-MITE reference sequences, consensus sequences instead
of the particular genomic copies described previously as
"reference copies". We analyzed the genomic sequence
using these consensus sequences (see Methods) as reference sequences, the reference sequences for other known
A. gambiae TEs and the few unknown repeats previously
identified.

Table 2 and 3 summarize the annotations for all the Pmasters and P-MITE families extracted from our genomic
survey of the PEST sequence. Table 2 shows for each family: (i) the length of the consensus used, (ii) the number
of copies, (iii) the number of copies with lengths differing
by no more than 5% from the consensus (as a first approximation, they can be considered here as complete elements), (iv) the number of copies per chromosome arms
and the corresponding density in copies per Mb, (v) the
median length of the copies, and this length expressed as
a percentage of the reference sequence, and (vi) the
median percentage of identity with the consensus
sequence. Table 3 shows the minimum, maximum and
quantiles of the pairwise percentage identity between the
genomic copies.
Whatever the P subfamily considered, the number of copies per subfamily was small (from 3 to 41) as was the
number of complete copies, which ranged from 1 to 6. PMITEs were more numerous (from 44 to 571) than their
P-master counterparts. They were also less markedly
deleted, as shown by their respective median lengths and
the proportion of complete copies relative to their total
copy number. An obvious explanation is that the longer a
sequence, the more random deletion can occur, and so
short sequences, such as MITEs, have undergone fewer
deletions.
The median pairwise percentage identity (see Table 3)
allowed us to estimate how old a family is, as old families
are more heterogeneous than recent ones and thus have
less pairwise identity. This in turn allowed us to propose a
chronology for their amplifications: P-MITE amplifications appear to have occurred more recently than the
amplifications of the corresponding P-masters, as shown
by the pairwise percentage identity quantiles. This finding
supports the hypothesis that these P-MITE families
derived initially from their P-master. All P-master sub-

families show about the same level of heterogeneity
(identity from 78.3% to 83.9%) and so can be considered
to have the same age, apart from the AgaP8 subfamily that
seems to be more recent (90.9%). However, it should be
noted that this value is calculated from only 17 copies.
Although more recent than their respective P-master, the
P-MITE families display a greater degree of heterogeneity
(median pairwise identity from 80.7% to 95.9%) meaning that their transposition activity must have occurred
several times over a longer period.
P-masters and their MITEs accumulate on the X chromosome (17.6%) compared to the expectation (9.7%) based
on the chromosome length and the total copy numbers
(goodness of fit χ2 = 106.2, 1df, p-value<2.2e-16). However, no significant differences were found between MITEs
and P-masters regarding their X versus autosomal copy
number distribution (homogeneity χ2 = 0.0087, 1df, pvalue = 0.92). However, this distribution differs significantly from that of other TEs (15.4%, χ2 = 5.5, 1df, p-value
= 0.019). Taken together, these observations suggest that
the mobility of both P elements and P-MITEs are controlled by the same mechanism.
The U chromosome contains unassigned scaffolds (that
cannot be located on a chromosome arm), concatenated
together in an arbitrary order, like an artificial chromosome. In a whole genome shotgun (WGS), these scaffolds
generally correspond to heterochromatic sequences
[24,25]. Moreover, the PEST A. gambiae strain is outbred,
and a number of individuals were sequenced. Therefore,
we expected to find polymorphic regions disrupting the
assembly. We expected these regions either to be present
in several copies in the assembly and/or not to have
enough coverage to be assembled at all. Consequently,
small contigs would probably correspond to these polymorphic sequences, and we therefore expected to find
them on the U chromosome. However, in the light of the
very high TE density (a 3 to 6 fold increase) on the U chromosome, we postulate that the vast majority of its
sequences are in fact heterochromatic, as it retains a feature specific to heterochromatic sequences: the TE density.
Consequently when we compared the U chromosome to
other chromosomes, we were in fact comparing heterochromatic sequences with euchromatic ones. The comparison showed that there was more P-masters (60%) than PMITEs (40%) in the heterochromatin (homogeneity χ2 =
44.5, 1df, p-value = 2.5e-11). If it is assumed that the TEs
in heterochromatic regions are the oldest, this observation
confirms that P-MITEs are more recent than the P-masters.
Other TEs were significantly less abundant (37%) than the
P-master (homogeneity χ2 = 68.2, 1df, p-value<2.2e-16),
and even than P-MITEs (homogeneity χ2 = 9.23, 1df, pvalue = 0.002). This could obviously be explained by a

bias toward recent TEs in the discovery of new TE families
(they are more abundant and less heterogeneous).
The mean GC% for consensus sequences is 35.1% and
38.1% for P-masters and P-MITEs respectively. They are
AT-rich as this is generally found for TEs [25,26]. For each
copy, we determined the GC% of its insertion site, taking
20 bp of the 5' flanking genomic sequence, and 20 bp of
3' flanking genomic sequence. The mean GC% for the Pmaster and P-MITEs insertion regions were 40.8% and
43.2% respectively. Compared to the GC% of the genome
(44.3%), the insertion preference appears to be biased
slightly towards AT-rich regions. The trend is less pronounced for P-MITEs than for P-masters, but matches
what has been reported for other Anopheles MITEs [27].
As expected, very few copies were found in exons, because
of their deleterious effect. Table 4 shows TEs occurrences
within or around the annotated genes. No differences in
the orientation of the TE copy in introns, or in 5' and 3'
500-bp transcript flanking region (compared to the gene
orientation) were statistically significant (data not
shown). The copy proportion in introns for P-MITEs
(14.9%) and other TEs (15.4%) were significantly lower
(goodness of fit χ2 = 8.011, 1df, p-value = 0.005 and χ2 =
80.73, 1df, p-value<2.2e-16 respectively) than what
would be expected by chance (17%, calculated as the proportion of introns in the genomic sequence). Other MITEs
(20.3%) had significantly higher copy proportions (goodness of fit χ2 = 45.1, 1df, p-value = 1.9e-11), whereas Pmaster (15.7%) was not significantly different (goodness
of fit χ2 = 0.31, 1df, p-value = 0.57).

Looking at the 500-bp transcript flanking regions, we can
see that P-masters and P-MITEs were over-represented in
the 5' flanking region compared to other TEs (homogeneity χ2 = 84.3, 1df, p-value<2.2e-16) or what would be
expected by chance (1.1%, calculated as the proportion of
the 5' flanking regions in the genomic sequence; goodness
of fit χ2 = 12.02, 1df, p-value = 5.3e-4). In contrast, we can
see that P-masters and P-MITEs are a clearly under-represented in the 3' flanking region when compared to other
TEs (homogeneity χ2 = 5.3, 1df, p-value = 0.02) or what
would be expected by chance (1.1%, calculated as the proportion of the 3' flanking regions in the genomic
sequence; goodness of fit χ2 = 22.6, 1df, p-value = 1.9e-6).
The 5' preference has already been reported for P elements
in D. melanogaster [28], and seems to be a feature of this
TE family. However, the 3' under representation is a new
feature. We have compared the 5'-3' distribution of PMITEs with that of other MITES. The 5'-3' distribution of
other MITEs is symmetric, and differs significantly from
that of P-MITEs (homogeneity χ2 = 35.13, 1df, p-value =
3e-9).
P-MITEs appear to be subject to greater counter-selection
in introns and in 3' flanking regions than other TEs. This
suggests that their insertions may have a major impact on
transcription. Specific features of P-MITE sequences might
be responsible for this, since P-masters behave differently.

Discussion
P element diversity
The diversity of P subfamilies in the A. gambiae genome is
intriguing. Firstly, the coexistence of distant P subfamilies

and the presence of MITEs with their source of transposase
in a same genome over a prolonged period is paradoxical.
Seven active (or recently active) P subfamilies coexist with
amino-acid identity percentages ranging from 49.0% to
53.7%. How have these transposases been differentiated
in the same genome? They must either have invaded the
genome successively after recurrent horizontal transfers,
or have evolved from a common ancestral resident
sequence, to form several subfamilies producing distinct P
transposases. Such functional differentiation would have
to be driven by specific selective pressures. This assumes
that each transposase and/or its associated transposition
events provide the element or the host with some specific
advantage. Such a selective advantage for the element
could be, for instance, that the new variant is able to transpose at higher rate, whereas an advantage for the host
could be that the element is rendered less harmful because
it transposes less. This antagonism between host and TE
fitness is resolved for a TE by a successful invasion of other
naïve species that are more permissive toward it. Otherwise, the element would become immobile by transposition repression and then degenerate rapidly as a result of
accumulating mutations. Consequently, new variants
must arise by mutation and escape the repression mechanism before degenerating. But the speed at which a population reaches a repressed transpositional state, as seen for
D. melanogaster P element, is rapid (~20 years). There is
very little time left for the variant to emerge, and this
would give families with near identical ages. The timing
compatible with this scenario could not account for the
similarities we observed amongst the families. Obviously
a new variant could emerge from dead copies, but this
appears rather unlikely. Alternatively, a new transposase
might benefit the host. It is known that transposable elements harbor a powerful potential repertoire of new functional genetic abilities that are frequently co-opted into
host functions. We have recently shown [19] that all P
transposases have the THAP domain, a DNA binding

domain which is also present in many cellular genes, and
is widely conserved in animals. In A. gambiae the P transposases also bear the THAP domain and consequently
may also interfere with THAP bearing cellular genes.
According to this hypothesis, transposases could have two
functions: one function is to mobilize P elements, the
other, to bind to a specific genomic target which could
confer an advantage on the host by altering a host gene
function. However, it is unlikely that this kind of evolutionary event could occur recurrently in the same genome
sufficiently often to account for such diversity.
The hypothesis of recurrent horizontal transfer events is
more likely. There are several pieces of evidence suggesting that horizontal transfer is the main, and perhaps the
only source of selective constraint on the P element transposase sequence [29,30]. In the Drosophila genus, the coexistence of multiple P subfamilies in the saltans and
willistoni species groups is probably the result of multiple
invasions all over the taxa in several successive horizontal
transfer events [30]. The multiple A. gambiae P subfamilies
could also have resulted from similar recurrent horizontal
transfers events.
The second intriguing point is the coexistence of ten PMITE families associated with their mobility factor (the Pmasters) in a same genome over a prolonged period. This
is also remarkable, because of the mutational genetic load
associated with the deleterious effect of the mobility of
MITEs. A selective constraint would minimize negative
effects by reducing the mobility of P-MITEs and P-masters.
One way this could have happened would be a reduction
in the transposase-coding copy number. The small
number of autonomous Pelements in the A. gambiae
genome may reflect this phenomenon. The current status
of the A. gambiae genome would then correspond to the
final invasion phase when P-sequences have begun to be
tamed.

The emergence of MITEs
P-MITE families share TIRs that are quite similar to these
of P transposons. This strongly supports the hypothesis
that MITEs, or at least their 5' and 3' parts, are derived
from class-II TEs, and replicate by "borrowing" the transpositional machinery of autonomous DNA transposons.
It should be noted that P-MITE and P-master copies both
have a TSD 8-bp in length, as predicted if the double
strand staggered breaks are produced by the same transposase.

Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that P elements originate from various P subfamilies that have
recurrently invaded following horizontal transfers and
then spread through A. gambiae populations. The pairwise
percentage identity values (Table 3), which reflect the
invasion burst ages, suggest that each P-MITE invasion
burst occurred after the invasion of their respective P-master. The median pairwise identity between P-MITE copies
within each family (ranging from 80.7% to 95.9%) shows
that P-MITE families have differing ages, and have probably emerged successively.
The origin of the MITE internal sequence remains controversial: it may either be derived from the internal part of
the master TE followed by nucleotide degeneration, or it
may have been copied from an ectopic site by a conversion process consecutive to a double strand break. We
have not been able to detect any significant nucleotide
similarity between the internal part of P-MITEs and the
internal sequence of any P-master counterpart. Are the
divergences between P-MITEs and their P-masters too
ancient to have conserved any detectable similarity? The
ranges of their intra subfamily diversity on the one hand,
and the P-MITEs 5' and 3' sequences similarity with their
respective P-master on the other hand, suggest that they
have emerged recently enough to have been able to retain
significant similarity in this central region. This observation rules out the former hypothesis. Terminal regions are
known to be essential for transposition, so the internal
region may evolve much more quickly than the terminal
sequences. But this is only true for a few base pairs.
Indeed, the D. melanogaster P transposase 2binds on ~20
bp [31] close to the TIRs and cleaves in the TIRs. The size
of this binding site is small in comparison to the P-master
fragments and cannot explain the conservation over ~100
bp.
In contrast, P transposon biology looks as if it supports
the latter hypothesis. Indeed, P elements in D. melanogaster are known to transpose via a "cut-and-paste"
mechanism, leading to a double strand DNA break, which
is repaired via a gap repair process using the sister chromatid or the homologous chromosome as template [32]. In
some cases, it has been shown that ectopic sequences can

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/214

be used as a template for this repair event [33]. Consequently, P-MITEs could have been derived from their Pmasters by a specific internal deletion retaining the TIRs
and their cis-acting DNA sequence required for P transposition, but repaired using an ectopic genomic sequence. In
addition, if the nucleotide composition of the chimeric
element provides a stable, secondary structure, it could
acquire a transposition advantage. The AT-richness of PMITEs promotes randomly occurring repeats, and thus
contributes to the stability of the secondary structure of PMITEs.
The MITE AgaP2-P12MITE with its two TIRs, which are
related to two different P-master subfamilies, suggests a
third possible mechanism. A MITE could emerge from
two P-masters located close to each other. This tandem of
P-copies could transpose en bloc, in what is called a "macrotransposition" [34]. The two initial inserted copies
could be partial, but one of them must retain its 5'
sequence and the other its 3' sequence, together with the
regions they require respectively for transposition. A deletion is likely to occur between these two copies during the
transposition process. As a result, a MITE may have
appeared, the central region of which corresponds to a
part of the genomic region located between the two initial
copies. This scenario could explain the formation of
AgaP2-P12MITE. Interestingly, this would also suggest
that MITE requires two P-master transposases, each one
bound at one end, in order to be mobilized. This would
be the first MITE to have been reported to have such a
requirement. Obviously, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that the P-master from which the AgaP2-P12MITE
derived had disappeared.
The PEST genome and the wild genome
One could suspect that the P-sequence composition of the
sequenced genome of A. gambiae is not representative of
the species, since the PEST strain is derived from a cross,
mixing two molecular forms (M and S forms) associated
with a reduction in gene flow between populations.
Indeed, the PEST strain was produced by cross-mating an
M-form laboratory strain with the field progeny of an S
form. Even though the genomic composition of the outbred colony was predominantly derived from the S molecular form, the assembly of the mosquito genome was
nevertheless hampered by the presence of multiple haplotypes, and the PEST strain appeared to have a mosaic
genomic structure [35]. However, our Southern blot
experiments did not detect clear-cut differences when
comparing the abundance in P sequences between the
DNA samples extracted from the PEST strain, and those
extracted from the M or S test populations. As a first
approximation, we can state that the PEST genome seems
to be representative of the A. gambiae s.s. wild genome, at
least in respect of TE distribution.

Genome dynamics
P-masters account for only 0.13% of the genome, whereas
P-MITEs account for 0.36%. Despite of their small size, as
a result of their sheer numbers, MITEs may contribute
more significantly to genome size than their master counterpart. But, how can we explain such a high number of
copies, when ectopic recombination is suspected of playing an important role in TE elimination [36,37]? The
strength of ectopic recombination as a mechanism of TE
copy elimination is obviously linked to the number of
copies present. Indeed, as each copy is a potential target
for an ectopic exchange, the more copies there are, the
more ectopic exchanges can occur. But the size of the copies matters too. Small copies are less likely to be involved
in such an exchange [37]. Since MITE sequences are short,
they may escape the ectopic exchange reduction process,
and thus remain present in large numbers within a
genome.

Our analysis of the P- MITEs chromosomal distribution
shows the same bias for the X chromosome than Anopheles
P-elements, an observation that provides further support
for a functional relationship between MITEs and the larger
coding elements. Bias in chromosomal distribution has
been reported both for MITEs and non-P DNA transposons in other organisms [38-40]. The X chromosome
bias could result from its rotation in the female germline:
X chromosomes are found 2/3 of the time in a female lineage versus 1/2 for autosomal chromosomes. Hence,
female-specific transposition regulation may change TE
densities ratio between X and autosomes. For instance,
maternal TE repression inheritance such as that known to
occur for P element regulation in D.melanogaster (called
"P-cytotype") can positively select repressor-producing
copies to be located on the X [41]. Indeed, X TE copies are
more often in a position to produce an effective repressor,
because they are transmitted to the offspring via the
oocyte cytoplasm. A repression mechanism of this type
can be more efficient for P elements, and thus the bias is
more pronounced for P elements than for other TEs
P for transgenesis
Recently, Rasgon and Gould [42] used computer simulation to study the transgene drive mechanism in an Anopheles population based on empirical data for P transposable
element as support. The success of the invasion of the
multiple P subfamilies and their MITEs throughout the A.
gambiae genome gives some clues about the ability of P
transgenic vectors, built from Anopheline P elements, to
invade mosquito populations. Firstly, it gives some
important information about how to construct a transgenic vector from Anopheline P elements. The deleted
copies of D.melanogaster P elements require at least 138 bp
at the 5' end and 216 bp at the 3' end for transposition
and excision [43]. The 5' and 3' P sequences at the ends of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/214

P-MITEs are in fact less than 100 bp long. This suggests
that only 100 bp is required at both ends of Anopheline
P-transgenes for them to be mobile. This casts a fresh light
on the engineering of Anopheline P vectors. Studies of the
mechanisms implicated in P MITE transposition and
amplification may help to improve P vectors further. Secondly, in D. melanogaster, genomic P elements are thought
to repress the mobility of P transgenes that originated
from the same P element subfamily. The diversity of P
transposase subfamilies in A. gambiae populations would
make it possible to find several specific transposase-TIR
pair combinations that are helpful for the amplification of
such vectors.

Conclusion
We provide the most exhaustive catalogue to date of P-like
transposons in the A. gambiae genome and present convincing, yet indirect, evidence that some of the subfamilies have been recently active. These elements can be
grouped into nine distinct subfamilies of various ages, six
of which appear to be related to ten different MITE families. We describe a remarkable genomic state corresponding to the coexistence of MITEs with their mobility factors.
P-MITEs and P elements show the same genomic distribution bias, which provides further support for a functional
relationship between MITEs and the larger coding elements. The mutational genetic load associated with the
deleterious effect of the mobility of MITEs probably exerts
a selective constraint on the transposase-coding copy
numbers. The small number of autonomous P elements
that we describe in the A. gambiae genome is in accordance
with this hypothesis and could reflect the final invasion
phase when the taming of P sequences began.

Methods
Genomic DNA extraction
The A. gambiae strains KISUMU (Kenya) and VK-per
(Burkina Faso) were kindly provided by the LIN Laboratory (UR016, IRD, Montpellier, France). The Yaoundé
strain (Cameroon), the Mbita strain (Kenya) and the DNA
of the PEST strain were kindly provided by the Biochimie
et Biologie Moléculaire des Insectes laboratory, Institut
Pasteur, Paris. PEST, KISUMU and Mbita are classified as
the S molecular form, and VK-per and Yaoundé as the M
molecular form, according to the classification system
based on X-linked rDNA repeat units that recognizes two
molecular forms, known as M and S [44,45]. This classification has to be taken in account, because the two forms
reduce the gene flow between the populations of the species [46]. The DNA was extracted from frozen adults as
previously described for Drosophila [47].
DNA blot analysis
DNA blot hybridizations were performed on 10 µg of
DNA per lane according to standard protocols (Maniatis,

Page 11 of 14

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:214

Fritsch and Sambrook 1982). Each blot contained DNA
from the five laboratory colonies described above. The
DNAs were digested either once with PvuII, or double
digested with ClaI and XhoI. These digests released large
internal fragments overlapping the coding regions of the
P subfamilies under test. In order to make it possible to
compare the patterns, each gel was bi-transferred as recommended by the supplier onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). The same samples were
thus successively hybridized with different P subfamilies
after dehybridization. The probes used were synthesized
by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) from PEST strain
DNA templates, and labeled with 32P-dCTP using the
High-Prime random priming kit (Amersham). The primer
sequences and PCR program are available on request.
In silico analysis
Genomic sequences
The tenfold whole genome shotgun assembly "MOZ2" of
the A.gambiae PEST strain was downloaded from the
Ensembl web site [48]

The gene annotations were downloaded from the UCSC
Genome Bioinformatics web site [49]
TE databases
The TE reference set used was derived from the A. gambiae
RepeatMasker repeat library [50] (A.F.A. Smit, R. Hubley
& P. Green RepeatMasker March 6, 2004), multiple alignments from Tu [27], and sequences from Eiglmeier et al
[51]. In the RepeatMasker repeat library LTR retrotransposable elements are divided into LTR sequences (present
on both side of the elements) and internal parts (the
regions between the two LTRs). We reconstructed full
length LTR retrotransposable elements from this library
by adding the LTR sequence on both sides of the internal
part. We derived consensus sequences for the MITEs
described in Tu [27] from the multiple alignments deposited in EMBL alignment database (accession nos.
DS43373-DS43385). A consensus sequence for the Indy
element (a non-autonomous LTR retrotransposable element) has been derived from a multiple alignment of the
genomic copies found in Eiglmeier et al [51].
Annotation pipeline
Transposable elements were annotated using the RMBLR
procedure from the TE annotation pipeline described by
Quesneville et al. [52]. Then, consecutive fragments on
both the genome and the same reference TE were automatically joined if they were separated by a sequence of
which more than 80% consisted of other TE insertions (in
this case, we have a nested TE). Note that the TE reference
set used to find the P element copies also includes other
known TEs of A. gambiae, which makes it possible to join
correctly distant fragments due to nested TE insertions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/214

Otherwise they were taken to be joined if they were separated by a gap of less than 5000 bp or by a mismatch
region of 500 nucleotides.
Simple repeats were found using the Tandem Repeat
Finder program [53] and used to filter out spurious hits.
All TE annotations that were less than 20 bp after removing any regions that overlapped simple repeat regions
were eliminated.
Consensus building
To build consensus sequences we first searched P genomic
copies using the P "reference copy" sequences (described
earlier, see Table 1). For each subfamily, we constructed
multiple alignments of the P copies (see below). Alignments were visually inspected. For some families, many
hits were restricted to a particular region of the reference
sequence, beginning and finishing at the same nucleotide
position. This happened when the reference sequence
contained an unidentified repeat that was also found at
many other positions within the genome, but without the
flanking sequences of the reference sequence. When this
occurred in the internal part of the element, we manually
edited the alignment to remove the columns corresponding to the repeat. In a few cases, a TIR region was included
in a tandemly or dispersed unknown repeat. In these
cases, we chose to add the unknown repeat (containing
the TIR) to the reference set used to annotate the genome,
so that MATCHER would assign these hits as not belonging to a P subfamily. For a few subfamilies, some hits were
restricted to a short alignment region with fuzzy limits.
When these regions corresponded to a much-degenerated
microsatellite (too degenerate to be detected by TRF), we
removed the columns that corresponded to these spurious
hits. For each multiple alignment, we derived a consensus
by selecting the majority nucleotide at each column position. Note that consequently the size of the consensus
sequences differs slightly from those of the "genomic reference copies". This is particularly true for
AgaP8MITE2450 whose copies are heterogeneous in size
due to several independent insertions.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the R software
environment [54].
Multiple alignments
Multiple alignments for each family were obtained by first
computing the pairwise global alignment with the reference sequence using the gap program [55], and second by
stacking all pairwise alignments to obtain a multiple
alignment. Any sequences not present in the reference
sequence were removed from the multiple alignments.
The consensus was then obtained from a multiple alignment using a simple majority rule.
