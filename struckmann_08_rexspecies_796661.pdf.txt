Abstract
Background: Annotated phylogenetic trees that display the evolution of transcription factor
binding in regulatory regions are useful for e.g. 1) narrowing down true positive predicted binding
sites, providing predictions for binding sites that can be tested experimentally, and 2) giving insight
into the evolution of gene regulation and regulatory networks.
Results: We describe ReXSpecies, a web-server that processes the sequence information of a
regulatory region for multiple species and associated (predicted) transcription factor binding sites
into two figures: a) An annotated alignment of sequence and binding sites, consolidated and filtered
for ease of use, and b) an annotated tree labeled by the gain and loss of binding sites, where the
tree can be calculated from the data or taken from a trusted taxonomy, and the labels are
calculated based on standard or Dollo parsimony. For genes involved in mammalian pluripotency,
ReXSpecies trees highlight useful patterns of transcription factor binding site gain and loss, e.g. for
the Oct and Sox group of factors in the 3' untranslated region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator gene, which closely match experimental data.
Conclusion: ReXSpecies post-processes the information provided by transcription factor binding
site prediction tools, in order to compare data from many species. The tool eases visualization and
successive interpretation of transcription factor binding data in an evolutionary context. The
ReXSpecies URL can be found in the Availability and requirements section.

Background
Elucidating how genes are regulated is an important step
in understanding the processes of life. One approach to
infer gene regulation and regulatory networks is to predict
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in genomic
sequence data. These TFBSs may be located upstream or

downstream of known genes, or be part of their UTRs
(untranslated regions). There are already tools available
for searching genomic regions from multiple species for
TFBSs such as Mapper [1,2] or Genomatix MatInspector
[3]. These tools use TFBS models represented by Hidden
Markov Models (HMM, used by Mapper), Position SpePage 1 of 18

cific Weight Matrices (PWM, used by Genomatix), or
IUPAC consensus sequences (Genomatix) to predict
TFBSs in a DNA sequence. In case of Mapper, the source
of models are Jaspar [4] and Transfac [5]; Genomatix uses
a database of TFBS developed in-house. The DNA motif
that these tools are designed to match is usually short
(about 8–20 base pairs) and thus it is not surprising, that
there are many false positive matches. We showcase that
the visualization and study of the evolutionary history of
regulatory regions can be insightful, and that it helps to
separate the wheat from the chaff. We argue that beyond
evolutionary conservation of binding sites, plausible patterns of common gain and loss of TFBSs in evolution ease
this separation.
An evolutionary approach for TFBS prediction is phylogenetic footprinting [6], based on the idea that the
sequences coding a regulatory element should be preserved across different species. Phylogenetic footprinting
methods try to discover TFBS in a set of orthologous regulatory regions from multiple species, by identifying the
best conserved motifs in those orthologous regions [7].
We propose here to make a step forward with respect to
already well-established phylogenetic footprinting servers
such as FootPrinter [8], providing a tool for analyzing and
visualizing the evolution of the binding sites. Up to now,
large and even small amounts of data had to be digested
and visualized manually for this task, by writing down all
predictions for each sequence, positioning these in the
alignment, and annotating a trusted species tree with
them. The annotated alignment then highlights conserved
TFBSs and the annotated tree describes the evolution
(gain and loss) of binding sites.
With the exception of Mulan [9], visualization approaches
published up to now do not calculate nor consider phylogenetic trees. Moreover, there is no tool that can annotate
phylogenetic trees with TFBS information, nor is there a
multiple alignment visualization that also presents a multiple alignment of the TFBSs.
In particular, CONREAL [10] gives an alignment overview
for two sequences only. Similarly rVista [11] only handles
pairwise sequence comparison. In contrast, multiTF [9]
displays TFBSs and conservation for multiple species, but
without considering TFBS predictions separately for each
species, they are all listed in one track. Mulan [9] produces
an annotated alignment, but it uses only pairwise alignments of each sequence with a reference sequence; multiTF identifies conserved TFBS in the Mulan output, and
displays the result pairwise using rVista [11]. It displays an
unannotated distance tree of the sequences to inform the
user about the phylogenetic relationship of the sequences.
PRODORIC [12] is suitable for bacterial genomes only.
The ECRBrowser [13] is a genome browser showing only

sequence conservation and TFBS predictions that are
precomputed, just like UCSC [14,15] and EnsEMBL
[16,17].
To fill some of the gaps not covered by the tools listed
above we have written ReXSpecies with the following
specification.
1. Import TFBS predictions from different sources (since
March 2008 TFBS predictions may be obtained directly,
see "Note added in proof");
2. Filter TFBS predictions to extract the relevant ones;
3. Visualize evolution of TFBSs using an annotated tree
and an annotated alignment;
4. Analyze validity of the TFBS predictions by calculating
trees out of the TFBS predictions, the sequence alignment
and/or a concatenation of both using MrBayes [18,19];
5. Provide access via a web front end;
6. Provide a modular design to make extensions possible;
7. Offer a simple Wiki and functionality to share results.
A significant limitation in the understanding of gene regulation and regulatory networks is the lack in visualizing
and mastering patterns associated with the very large
amounts of data generated by technology such as DNA
sequencing, ChIP on Chip, ChIP-seq, and microarrays.
ReXSpecies is intended to reduce this limitation. It can be
accessed via a web front end [20] and a tutorial is available
there [21].

Implementation
ReXSpecies Workflow
To automate digestion and visualization of the evolution
of regulatory regions, we have developed ReXSpecies
(Regulation Across Species). The software can be used via
a web front end [20]. ReXSpecies is divided into different
modules. Most important modules are the rendering
module, the alignment module, the TFBS module, and the
file module. The common work flow is to upload the data
using the file module, manage the data using the alignment and the TFBS module and finally combining the
data with the rendering module; see Figure 1 for details.
Input and output
The input for ReXSpecies are a set of homologous
sequences, predicted TFBSs for these sequences (e.g. produced by Mapper [1,2] or Genomatix [3], since March
2008 TFBS predictions may be obtained directly, see
"Note added in proof"), and a phylogenetic tree (the tree

Figure 1
Workflow overview
Workflow overview. Uploaded sequences are processed by the alignment module. If necessary, they are aligned using Muscle [22,23] and sorted alphabetically or in a user-defined way. TFBS predictions from Mapper [1,2] and Genomatix MatInspector [3] are uploaded and then processed by the TFBS module, which places TFBS predictions onto the sequence alignment
(since March 2008 TFBS predictions may be obtained directly, see "Note added in proof"). The TFBS module then filters the
TFBS predictions, e.g. by E-value, by species-label of the TFBS model, or by TFBS name. Then the TFBS module groups the
TFBSs by name and position. Finally the alignment, the input tree, and the TFBS predictions are put together by the rendering
module resulting in an annotated alignment and an annotated species tree. Alternatively, a tree can be calculated from the
alignment (including TFBS predictions) using MrBayes [18,19] and be annotated as well.

is an optional input). Sequences in FASTA format can be
read, but ReXSpecies can convert other formats to FASTA.
If the sequences are not aligned, ReXSpecies can align
them using Muscle [22,23].
The most simple format for TFBS predictions that ReXSpecies can read is the Mapper output format (a tab separated
plain text file with the columns Model ID, Factor name,
Strand, Start, End, Score, and E-value). Moreover, ReXSpecies can read Genomatix-generated HTML tables directly.
Last but not least, XML import/export of TFBS predictions
is possible, see [24]. Phylogenetic trees can be read in
Newick or NEXUS format.
ReXSpecies generates HTML output containing an annotated alignment and an annotated tree as described below.
These HTML documents may be saved locally by current
web browsers.
Annotated alignment
To provide an overview over the TFBS predictions, the
sequence alignment annotated with TFBS predictions can
be calculated and displayed for comparison across species, see Figure 2 and Additional file 1 for an example of
the annotated alignment of an upstream regulatory region
of the pluripotency gene Nanog. The alignment makes
available additional information about the TFBSs when
the mouse pointer moves over a prediction.
Filtering
To reduce the number of TFBS annotations, we filter them
based on the E-value of the matches by setting a threshold.
Predictions with an E-value larger than a given threshold
are hidden. Because the prediction of TFBSs based on a
short motif in a long sequence is not very accurate, this filter should not be set too strict. In case of Mapper we take
the E-values as provided. To generate E-values for the
Genomatix [3] predictions, we use a patched version of
the implementation of the Extreme Value Distribution
(EVD) method in Bioperl-ext [25,26].

Moreover, a filter routine based on regular expressions
[27] is implemented. It can hide TFBSs based on any field
in the Mapper/Genomatix TFBS prediction record, which
contains information about the name of the TFBS, the
position of the TFBS in the sequence investigated, and the
score of the match. Another relevant field in the filter tool
is the set of species the TFBS model is made from; for
example all plant TFBSs can be filtered out if Mammals are
investigated only, because most likely all predictions of
plant TFBSs in a mammalian sequence are false positive.
Grouping
TFBS predictions in the same species may belong to
slightly different models of the same factor, and predic-

largest E-Value (i.e. to the E-Value threshold). This figure shows the first quarter of

tions in different species may belong to orthologous factors, and we may wish to group them together if they
occur at approximately the same position. Positions may
vary slightly, because the alignment is unaware of the
TFBSs, or because models are slightly different. Moreover,
such slightly different models for the same or for an
orthologous transcription factor may have very different
names derived from synonyms, e.g. POU5F1 versus Oct4.
We therefore use a simple heuristic approach that groups
TFBSs together if they have the same transcription factor
name and at least one coordinate (start or end) in common. This is a heuristic, but otherwise, if we simply check
for overlap, we may group two predictions in cases where
the first ends at a position where the second one just
begins. We also allow the user to specify rules for grouping
factors, if they have different names. Such rules may be
"POU3 starting at alignment position 3 is the same as
POU3 starting at alignment position 6.", "POU5F1 starting at alignment position 3 is the same as Oct4 starting at
alignment position 3.", or even "POU5F1 starting at alignment position 3 is the same as Oct4 starting at alignment
position 6." See also Figure 3 for a screenshot of the form
for grouping.
Tree reconstruction
If a species tree is not part of the initial input, ReXSpecies
can build it from the aligned sequences that are forming
the conserved part of the regulatory region investigated,
and/or from the TFBS predictions in that region. To calculate a tree from the TFBS predictions, we have implemented an interface to MrBayes [18,19]. We calculate a
feature bitmap (an array of binary values) from the belowthreshold predictions. Each column refers to a TFBS at a
specific alignment position and each row corresponds to
a sequence (species) in the alignment (see Figure 4),
where we set 1 if the TFBS is predicted and 0 otherwise.
Orientation of binding sites is taken into account, if they
are not grouped with others (see the previous paragraph).
Without grouping, if a binding site is present at a sequence
position in both orientations, it is listed twice. The resulting bitmap can be given to MrBayes [18,19] for tree calculation alone or combined with the sequence alignment.
Retrieving more plausible results (that are trees matching
closer with e.g. the NCBI species tree [28,29]) using the
bitmap than without using it implies that the predicted
TFBSs contain some phylogenetic information. In turn,
including the sequence alignment as part of the input data
usually leads to a more plausible tree because it contains
some phylogenetic information outside the TFBS motifs.
Annotated Tree
To infer hypotheses about the evolution of the regulatory
region in question, ReXSpecies labels the leaves of a tree
for the species investigated with the filtered TFBS predic-

tions and the internal nodes (referring to ancestral species) with the gain/loss information based on parsimony
(see Figure 5 and Additional file 2). Currently Fitch parsimony [30] and Dollo parsimony [31,32] are implemented. Fitch parsimony places labels so that it
minimizes the number of changes that have to be supposed to explain the data. Dollo parsimony places labels
so that it minimizes the number of changes under the
assumption that feature loss and re-gain of the same feature later is impossible, see also Figure 6.
Technical details
Software architecture
ReXSpecies consists of a number of modules written in
Perl extending the Web-Application base class using multiple inheritance. These modules should only contain callback functions (i.e. functions, called by the base class) to
register them in the menu or to generate their user interface. All other functionality should be kept separate in private objects. The Web-Application class provides
persistence, user management, and objects of common
classes for Perl CGI scripts.

For calculations that last too long to be done interactively
(e.g. tree calculation) we have implemented a job spooler
running as a server process.
Dependencies
Due to the large set of bioinformatics libraries available,
we decided to use Perl. We use many modules from CPAN
(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) [33] available
under various open source licenses, e.g. Bioperl [25]. The
tree rendering is done by an overloaded version of
Bio::Phylo [34]. The database back end is currently based
on MySQL [35]. For user management there is a module
supporting a LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) [36] user database.

Results and Discussion
Reliability of predicted TFBS
Before reporting and discussing evolutionary hypotheses
based on predicted transcription factor binding sites, we
would like to show that these predictions are not random,
despite the high rate of incorrect predictions. Towards this
aim, we calculated species trees using a homologous regulatory region from different species, with and without
considering the array of binary values (bitmap) derived
from the TFBS predictions. As shown in Figure 7, a
MrBayes tree of the highly conserved part of the 3'UTR
regulatory region of the CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene based on sequence
alone has very low resolution, but a tree based on both
sequence and predictions is much more resolved and it
comes closer to the species tree, taking the NCBI taxonomy [28,29] as reference. Similar improvements can be

Define groups manually. A screenshot of the form for defining groups manually. A group can be created by entering a name
and assigning predictions. The predictions that may be assigned are listed with name, strand information, position in the alignment, length, and E-value. Here, two groups E4BP4 and E4BP4' were created and 3 predictions are assigned to the first group,
and two predictions are assigned to the second group. The predictions are shown in grey, once they have been hidden.

obtained for the other regulatory regions we investigated
(data not shown). We note that consideration of TFBS predictions is more than an implicit up-weighting of the subregions of the regulatory region carrying them, because all
subsequences matching a TFBS up to the pre-specified
threshold are considered equivalent. In other words, the
subsequence giving rise to the TFBS prediction is consid-

ered twice for calculation of the phylogeny, but its consideration as a TFBS prediction glosses over the exact
sequence of DNA bases by converting it into a higher-level
feature. In any case, improvement of trees demonstrates
that while a lot of the predictions are noise, it will be
worthwhile to analyze them in detail, because at least
some of them are meaningful.

Stem cells and pluripotency
Stem cells are currently a major topic of interest and in
this section we use ReXSpecies to explore the regulation of
genes involved in mammalian stem cell pluripotency. We

define pluripotency as the ability to undergo self-renewal
and the potential to form all different cell types of the
body [37]. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent
and they are important for the development of cellular

Fitch and Dollo parsimony
Fitch and Dollo parsimony. Difference between reconstruction of the gain/loss-labeling for a tree using Fitch parsimony
versus Dollo parsimony. The black circles are (ancestral) species that display a certain feature (have a certain TFBS), the white
circles are (ancestral) species that do not show the feature. Red circles or lines symbolize a parsimony-based reconstructed
loss event and blue circles are a gain event respectively. Fitch parsimony [30] minimizes the total number of changes that must
be assumed to explain the tree labeling. In the example Fitch parsimony assumes only 3 changes but includes one re-gain event.
Because we consider re-gain of a TFBS that was lost at exactly the same position rather unlikely we also offer Dollo parsimony
[31,32], that prohibits re-gain. This results in fewer events at the inner nodes.

regenerative therapies for medical conditions with irreversible tissue damage or loss [38]. Efforts to realize this
potential and to be able to reprogram somatic cells to
pluripotent like cells with properties similar to ESCs
require a better understanding of the interplay of the transcription factors and their binding sites involved in the
regulation of the transcriptional network that is behind
the ability of ESCs to maintain the pluripotent state [39].
In the last years, the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and
Nanog have been identified to be master regulators of
pluripotency, providing ESCs with extensive self-renewal
potential/capacity [37]. For these three key regulators,
TFBS models are available for searches by Mapper [1,2]
and Genomatix [3]. For Octamer binding in general, there
are 15 HMM models in Mapper and 10 models in Genomatix available, but there is no Oct4-specific model. For
Sox, there are 8 models in Mapper and 6 models provided
by Genomatix. To be as specific as possible for Sox2, we
include a Sox2 HMM model based on the binding site
data in [40]. For Nanog, only Genomatix offers a single

model that is not very sensitive, however; we found
matches only in Lemur (see below).
Evolution of the CFTR 3' UTR regulatory region
We have chosen to analyse the evolution of the 3'UTR of
the CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator) gene, since the genomic region containing
CFTR was an early whole-genome sequencing effort,
where targeted genomic regions in multiple vertebrates
were sequenced and compared [41]. This effort generated
over 12 megabases (Mb) of sequences from 12 model species, all derived from the genomic region orthologous to a
segment of about 1.8 Mb on human chromosome 7 containing ten genes, including the gene for cystic fibrosis.
These sequences were shown to have conservation reflecting both, functional constraints and the neutral mutational events that shaped the genomic region. Moreover,
we selected CFTR because the 5'UTR of CFTR has been
analyzed in phylogenetic footprinting studies [42]. Here,
we will discuss the Sox/Oct predicted binding sites in the
3'UTR regulatory region of the CFTR gene that we found

Figure Trees derived from the conserved 3'UTR regulatory region of the CFTR gene
Species 7
Species Trees derived from the conserved 3'UTR regulatory region of the CFTR gene. The tree on the left is
based on both the DNA sequence (approx. 150 bases of highly conserved sequence) and the TFBS predictions; the tree on the
right is based on DNA sequence only. There are fewer polytomies in the tree based on the larger amount of information, but
data is not sufficient to resolve more than a few more correct groupings such as carnivora (Felis and Canis) and glires (Mus and
Oryctolagus)

conserved for 8 model species. The region is found conserved in the Amniota. The region is not found in other
Vertebrata; for example it is not found in fugu (Takifugu
rubripes). The annotated alignment and the annotated tree
can be found in Figures 8, 9 and 10. For these figures, the
following standard filters were applied to consolidate the
TFBS predictions. The E-Value threshold was set empirically to 7. Plant, fly and yeast-specific TFBS were eliminated using a regular expression. Grouping was done as
described in Additional file 3.
Interestingly, in Figure 10, the predicted Oct binding site
at position 114 and the Sox2 binding site at position 126
of the alignment are inferred to be present for the ancestor
of the Amniota, and they get lost together for platypus
(Ornithorhynchus anatinus) and mouse (Mus musculus).
Similarly, the predictions "Oct at position 86" and "Sox2
at position 167" are both inferred to be appear along the
lineage from Amniota to Mammalia, and they are both

lost for Marsupialia (wallaby, Macropus eugenii). Such
patterns of common gain and loss are giving credibility to
these TFBS predictions. Curiously, the "Oct at position
86" prediction goes together with the prediction of an
upstream Sox2 binding site in platypus, cow, sheep and
mouse. In contrast to the "Oct at position 86" site, this
predicted Sox2 binding site has probably evolved independently four times, since its position varies. Only in
case of mouse, the "Oct at position 86" binding site consists of a regulatory PORE-like sequence (palindromic
octamer response element) previously identified in the
gene osteopontin [43]. As expected, an intact PORE-like
sequence corresponds to strong homodimer (Oct4/Oct4)
formation [43], confirmed by electromobility shift
(EMSA) experimental data (Figure 11). Moreover, there is
a predicted "Oct at position 86" site if and only if EMSA
data report strong monomer Oct4 protein binding in the
genomic region orthologous to the segment containing
the mouse PORE-like sequence for platypus (Ornitho-

rhynchus anatinus), cow (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries)
and mouse (Mus musculus), but not for the other species,
see Figure 11. Finally, for these four species, there is a predicted "HOMF at position 43" binding site if and only if
experimental data report heterodimer Oct4/Sox2 binding.
The latter prediction provides the experimentalist with a
hypothesis regarding the cooperative binding of transcription factors; "HOMF" (V$HOMF) is a binding site model
(to be precise, a family of weight matrices) defined by
Genomatix that includes various homeodomain transcription factors, namely Barx2, Gsh2, Hoxb-9, HOXC13,
Phox2a (ARIX) and Phox2b [44]. The pig sequence is very
different from the other sequences and it does not carry
any Oct/Sox predicted binding sites (data not shown);
this corresponds to the lack of strong binding in Figure 11,
which may be triggered by divergent TFBS for which the Evalue is too large. Finally, we found matches of the Nanog
TFBS (Genomatix HOXF/NANOG) only in Lemur, at
positions 2–18 (see Figure 8).
Evolution of the Nanog 5' regulatory region
In addition to Oct4/Sox2, Nanog is a key player of
pluripotency [45]. The evolution of the first upstream
conserved part of its 5' regulatory region is visualized in
Figures 2 and 5 (and in Additional files 1 and 2). The most

prominent observation is the large number of predicted
TFBSs of stem-cell relevant transcription factors appearing
on the lineage from Theria to Eutheria which may be associated with the developmental changes that occurred during the evolution from Theria to Eutheria. These
predictions are found to appear in a region conserved for
all Theria; this region comprises, in part, the region shown
in Figure 2 and the first quarter of the region shown in
Additional file 1. In particular, "SMAD at position 14" is
found from Eutheria onwards with the exception of Insectivora, "Oct6 at position 53" is found in all Eutheria
except E. Europaeus (Insectivora) and Carnivora, denoted
by the synonym OCTB. Curiously, "Sox9 at position 57"
first appears closeby for the same set of species with the
caveat that it was lost in Rodents. "Otx2 (orthodendicle)
at position 84" is also found for all Eutheria, except E. telfairi, denoted by a Genomatix family of weight matrices
called HOXF. Very recently, Zhou et al [46] identified
Otx2 as a "core regulator in mouse ESC" (embryonic stem
cells), noting that it had not "been implicated in ESC
maintenance" before. Finally, outside of the region conserved in all Theria, within the last three quarters of the
region shown in Additional file 1, we find a plethora of
other relevant predictions, e.g. predicted binding of
"EKLF" (erythroid Krueppel-like factor; only very recently

Annotated tree of the CFTR 3'UTR regulatory region
Annotated tree of the CFTR 3'UTR regulatory region. The NCBI common species tree [28,29] labeled with TFBS predictions for Oct4, Sox2, and HOMF only, for the region shown in Figure 9. The boxes contain TFBS predictions for each node
in the tree. We use the TFBS names of Mapper and Genomatix. According to Dollo parsimony the TFBSs written in green are
gained at the corresponding node, the red ones are lost. In blue we list TFBSs that are estimated to be present for the (ancestral) species at the node in question. We infer that Oct 114 (the Oct binding site at position 114) and Sox 126 were already
present for all amniotes, and that they both disappeared for platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) and mouse. Another come-andgo pattern can be seen in case of Oct 86 and Sox2 167: We infer that both have evolved in the lineage from amniotes to mammals, and disappeared in the lineage leading to the marsupial (Macropus).

the involvement of Klf4 (Krueppel-like factor 4) in
pluripotency was shown [47]). However, their uniqueness
to Eutheria is not as clear as in the cases described above,
because no homologous region could be obtained for the
non-Eutherian opossum (M. domestica), and it is possible
that the region in question still exists in opossum, and
that it did not evolve in Eutheria.
Preliminary analyses of conserved regulatory regions of
other key pluripotency genes yield further interesting
observations that may give rise to hypotheses about the
regulation of pluripotency. Downstream of the Oct4
(POU5F1) gene we find conserved predicted TFBSs of
stem-cell relevant transcription factors such as Sox, STAT,
SMAD, EKLF, SP1, Pax and FKHD. Downstream of the
Sox2 gene the most interesting finding is that among all
Amniota, only human has a predicted Oct/Sox binding
motif (data not shown).

Multi-species EMSA analysis performed with recombinant
Multi-species EMSA analysis performed with recombinant Oct4 and Sox2 incubated with part of the
CFTR 3' UTR. EMSA analysis [43] was performed with
recombinant Oct4 and Sox2 proteins and with radiolabeled
sequences showing mobility of DNA-protein complexes
formed on gels. Oct4D refers to homodimer (Oct4/Oct4),
Oct4H to Oct4/Sox2 heterodimer and Oct4M to Oct4 monomer formation. Lane 1: purified recombinant proteins Oct4
and Sox2 incubated with bovine CFTR sequence resulted in
strong monomer (Oct4), weak homodimer (Oct4/Oct4), and
weak heterodimer formation (Oct4/Sox2); Lane 2: purified
recombinant proteins Oct4 and Sox2 incubated with mouse
CFTR sequence resulted in monomer (Oct4), homodimer
(Oct4/Oct4), and heterodimer formation (Oct4/Sox2); lane
3: purified recombinant proteins Oct4 and Sox2 incubated
with chicken CFTR sequence resulted in no Oct4 protein
binding; lane 4: purified recombinant proteins Oct4 and Sox2
incubated with sheep CFTR sequence resulted in monomer
(Oct4), and heterodimer formation (Oct4/Sox2); lane 5:
purified recombinant proteins Oct4 and Sox2 incubated with
wallaby CFTR sequence resulted in no Oct4 protein binding;
lane 6: purified recombinant proteins Oct4 and Sox2 incubated with pig CFTR sequence resulted in weak monomer
(Oct4) and weak heterodimer formation (Oct4/Sox2); lane 7:
purified recombinant proteins Oct4 and Sox2 incubated with
platypus CFTR sequence resulted in monomer (Oct4) binding; lane 8: purified recombinant proteins Oct4 and Sox2
incubated with lemur CFTR sequence resulted in weak monomer (Oct4) and weak heterodimer formation (Oct4/Sox2);
lane 9: empty lane; lane 10: control with purified recombinant protein Oct4 alone incubated with mouse CFTR
sequence resulted in monomer (Oct4) and homodimer
(Oct4/Oct4) binding. 27 bp EMSA oligonucleotides for each
species were all derived from the genomic region orthologous to a segment containing the PORE-like sequence from
mouse (ATTTGTGATGCAAAT).

Caveats in interpreting predicted TFBS
We already discussed the most obvious problem with
using genomic (sequence) data and associated predicted
binding sites, namely the large number of mis-predictions. We would like to exemplify two further problems.
First, we have to consider that the set of transcription factors and TFBS known for various species is incomplete, so
we never know whether we are dealing with orthologous
TFs or paralogous TFs (a very similar problem, called "hidden paralogy", complicates species tree inference, see Martin and Burg [48]). In fact, our Sox2 binding site
predictions are based on a model that may also match
binding sites of other Sox factors; it is even possible that
Sox2 does not bind at TFBSs predicted using this model,
but other Sox factors do. Recently, it was shown that Sox
binding sites found adjacent to Oct binding sites of genes
involved in pluripotency are not functionally important
[49]. Other Sox factors (Sox4, Sox11, Sox15) may bind,
and Sox2 was shown to be an upstream regulator of
pluripotency instead. However, while such insights may
modify the evolutionary analysis, they do not usually
invalidate it.

Secondly, significance of our observations is hard to
quantify. As in many areas of scientific investigation, the
"wheat", i.e. the observations deemed valuable and subsequently reported, may simply be chance findings that are
to be expected if a large amount of data is analyzed. In
other words, looking at sufficiently many predicted TFBS,
we are doomed to find chance correlations that seem to
make evolutionary sense, e.g. common gain and loss of
TFBS. Therefore, we should not get tired to stress that all
in-silico analysis should be followed up by experimental
validation. Evolutionary patterns can narrow down true
positive predictions, but they cannot identify them. A
combined analysis of in-silico and experimental data is

The Nanog region investigated. The conserved region upstream of the human Nanog gene (chr12:7,833,114–7,833,418)
shown in the UCSC genome browser [14,15]. The region was selected based on the conservation track and the multiz17way
table. This table contains two conserved regions in the conserved block from 7,833,139–7,833,205 found by looking at the
genome browser: 7,833,114–7,833,185 and 7,833,185–7,833,418. These two regions are next to each other, thus the full
region from 7,833,114 to 7,833,418 was searched for TFBSs. All coordinates refer to UCSC: Human Mar. 2006 Assembly.

yet another approach, and it is important future work to
add experimental TFBS data (e.g. ChIP on Chip, [50]) to
our visualizations, aiming at a deeper understanding of
the evolution of biological features such as the regulation
of pluripotency.

and add likelihood based methods for labeling, as well as
add TFBS prediction modules to enable use without
Genomatix or Mapper access, automated grouping by
clustering of TFBS predictions, and import of experimental (e.g. ChIP on Chip [50]) data.

Conclusion

Availability and requirements

The ReXSpecies web-server is able to give deeper insights
into the evolution of regulatory regions by providing
sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees annotated
with predictions for TFBSs and their gain or loss. In the
future we plan to automate more tasks so that finally the
input will only be a gene and the output will be an overview of its putative regulatory regions across different species annotated with TFBS predictions, a tree labeled with
those predictions including gain/loss information at the
edges, and possibly even a regulatory network inferred
from the TFBS predictions. Towards this end, automation
of the retrieval of sequence information and TFBS predictions is planned. Moreover, we wish to add more tree estimation tools besides MrBayes [18,19], e.g. RAxML [51],
