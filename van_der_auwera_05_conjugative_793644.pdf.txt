Abstract
Background: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus thuringiensis belong to the genetically
close-knit Bacillus cereus sensu lato group, a family of rod-shaped Gram-positive bacteria. pAW63 is
the first conjugative plasmid from the B. cereus group to be completely sequenced.
Results: The 71,777 bp nucleotide sequence of pAW63 reveals a modular structure, including a
42 kb tra region encoding homologs of the Type IV secretion systems components VirB11, VirB4
and VirD4, as well as homologs of Gram-positive conjugation genes from Enterococcus, Lactococcus,
Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species. It also firmly establishes the existence of a common
backbone between pAW63, pXO2 from Bacillus anthracis and pBT9727 from the pathogenic Bacillus
thuringiensis serovar konkukian strain 97-27. The alignment of these three plasmids highlights the
presence of well conserved segments, in contrast to distinct regions of high sequence plasticity. The
study of their specific differences has provided a three-point reference framework that can be
exploited to formulate solid hypotheses concerning the functionalities and the molecular evolution
of these three closely related plasmids. This has provided insight into the chronology of their
divergence, and led to the discovery of two Type II introns on pAW63, matching copies of the
mobile element IS231L in different loci of pXO2 and pBT9727, and the identification on pXO2 of
a 37 kb pathogenicity island (PAI) containing the anthrax capsule genes.
Conclusion: The complete sequence determination of pAW63 has led to a functional map of the
plasmid yielding insights into its conjugative apparatus, which includes T4SS-like components, as
well as its resemblance to other large plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria. Of particular interest is
the extensive homology shared between pAW63 and pXO2, the second virulence plasmid of B.
anthracis, as well as pBT9727 from the pathogenic strain B. thuringiensis serovar konkukian strain 9727.

Background
The Bacillus cereus sensu lato family of rod-shaped Grampositive bacteria contains six subspecies that are geneti-

cally very close [1] but nonetheless have highly specialized lifestyles, especially as concerns their respective
virulence spectra. Most notable are B. cereus sensu stricto,

an opportunistic pathogen which has been implicated in
food poisoning [2] and endophtalmitis [3], B. anthracis,
the etiological agent of anthrax [4], and B. thuringiensis
which produces δ-endotoxin crystals that are toxic to
insect larvae [5]. These subspecies are thought to have
emerged from a common ancestor following a series of
genetic rearrangements mediated inter alia by mobile
DNA elements (transposons, insertion sequences and
phages), in synergy with various mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (conjugation, transduction or transformation), leading to the acquisition of virulence genes.
This is exemplified by the presence of large virulence plasmids in B. anthracis (pXO1 and pXO2) [6], emetic strains
of B. cereus [7] and B. thuringiensis that carry the genes
responsible for the main phenotypic properties by which
these bacteria can be distinguished.
While the inter- and intra-molecular movements of
mobile elements can obviously have major consequences
for the organization and composition of the host genome,
it is probably the mechanism of conjugation that best enables the dispersion of these elements throughout the gene
pool. Several conjugation systems have been described in
Gram-negative bacteria, all of them involving the formation of a sex pilus to bring the participants in close contact, followed by the actual transfer of genetic material via
a type IV secretion system (T4SS) [8]. There is much less
data available concerning conjugation among Gram-positive bacteria, but the present consensus distinguishes four
main transfer strategies, the most common of which
seems to be that of the so-called broad host range plasmids. At present, the best characterized of these are the
multiresistance plasmids pSK41 [9] and pGO1 [10] from
Staphylococcus, pRE25 [11] from Enterococcus, pMRC01
[12] from Lactococcus and pIP501 [13] from Streptococcus
as recently reviewed by Grohmann and coworkers [14].
The broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pAW63 was
identified in B. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki, where it displays an efficient ability to conjugate in liquid medium,
both for its own transmission (around 10-3 transconjugants per donor in broth mating, up to a frequency of 1:1
between kurstaki strains) as well as that of small mobilizable plasmids [15]. Moreover, heterologous conjugation
experiments have shown that it is also capable of transfer
to its cousins B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis and B.
cereus, as well as to Bacillus sphaericus, Bacillus licheniformis
[15] and less closely related species such as Listeria innocua
and Enterococcus faecalis (A. Wilcks, pers. comm.; G. Van
der Auwera and J. Mahillon, unpublished).
In the present study, the complete sequence determination of pAW63 has led to a functional map of the plasmid
yielding insights into its conjugative apparatus, which
includes T4SS-like components, as well as its resemblance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/103

to other large plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria. Of particular interest is the extensive homology shared between
pAW63 and pXO2, the second virulence plasmid of B.
anthracis [16], as well as pBT9727 from the pathogenic
strain B. thuringiensis serovar konkukian strain 97-27 [17].

Results
pAW63 is a 71,777 bp circular molecule
The complete nucleotide sequence of pAW63 was determined to be 71,777 bp long with a G+C content of 33.8%.
Analysis of the coding content and organization revealed
few intergenic regions, and a total of 76 coding sequences
(CDSs) were identified (Fig. 1), of which all but 8 were
found to be in the same orientation (defined as counterclockwise). Interestingly, these 8 CDSs were all located in
close proximity to each other, and one of these (CDS 47)
corresponded to a component of the pAW63 replicon,
which was isolated and sequenced in a previous study
[18] while several others were later assigned putative functions as mobile genetic elements as detailed further in the
text. The sequence was found to have an 81% coding ratio
with an average CDS length of 768 bp. The largest CDS
identified was CDS 26, weighing in at 4,248 bp. Several
CDSs were associated to distinct spikes in G+C composition and will be discussed individually. The BLAST similarity searches showed that most of the 76 predicted CDSs
encoded proteins with similarity to proteins from other
organisms, although 36 of these were hypothetical proteins and only 26 could be attributed biological functions,
while 14 of the predicted genes did not have any known
homologs at all. The 26 genes encoding proteins with discernible functions were assigned to functional categories
according to a classification scheme adapted from Riley
[19]. The physical details and relevant BLAST hit results
(scored by percentage of amino acid identity) of all 76
CDSs are summarized in Table 1.
pAW63 generic relationships
Most of the significant similarity results originated from
Gram-positive bacteria species such as Enterococcus spp.,
Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Lactococcus spp. and
Listeria spp. in addition to Bacillus halodurans, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis and the members of the B. cereus
sensu lato group. It is of particular interest to note that out
of the 76 CDSs predicted on pAW63, 50 CDSs showed
strong similarity (between 48.8 and 98.7% amino acid
identity, with an average of 81.1%) to CDSs found on
pXO2 from B. anthracis [GenBank:NC_007323] and 49
CDSs showed strong similarity (between 43.8 and 97.4%
amino acid identity, with an average of 70.5%) to
pBT9727 from B. thuringiensis serovar konkukian [GenBank: CP_000047], with 42/76 (55.3%) of these CDSs
being shared by all three plasmids. This was consistent
with previous observations of sequence similarities
between these plasmids [18,20,21].

Replication and regulatory functions are grouped in an 8
kb 'control center'
All the elements that were putatively identified as being
directly involved in plasmid replication, copy control or
other regulatory processes were found to reside within an
8 kb region of the plasmid containing 12 CDSs (CDS 46
to 57), of which 6 could not be assigned to a functional
category. This region was delineated by mobile genetic
elements or remnants thereof, and contained five of the
eight CDSs that were found in clockwise orientation, the
other three being located in its gene mobility-associated
flanking sequences.

The 4.1 kb replicon of pAW63 was characterized in a previous study [18] and classified as belonging to the pAMβ1
family of theta-replicating conjugative plasmids, with
which it shares a similar cis-functioning origin of replication (ori). The largest of the four CDSs contained in this
region, Rep63A (CDS 47), displayed strong similarity to
the replication proteins of several plasmids in this family,
as well as 96% amino acid identity with the RepS protein
of the pXO2 replicon [18]. Rep63B, the second largest
CDS of the replicon (CDS 48), displayed strong similarity
with copy control proteins RepB and PrgP from the Enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmids pAD1 [22] and
pCF10 [23], respectively [18]. Although the two smaller
CDSs (49 and 50) did not display any significant homologies, the authors noted that one of these, CDS 49,
showed properties (location, size, orientation and
hydrophilicity) that likened it to repC and prgO, which are
putative genes encoding stability functions on pAD1 and
pCF10, respectively.

Upon further sequencing of the plasmid, three additional
putative regulatory elements were identified in close proximity to the replicon. These elements (CDS 51, 52 and 57)
were homologs of genes that are highly conserved
throughout the B. cereus group as well as in some less
closely related species. CDS 51 and 52 displayed significant homologies to an oligopeptide ABC transporter functioning as a pheromone binding protein, and to a DNAbinding protein, respectively. The clockwise-oriented CDS
57 showed a distinctly low overall G+C content and was
found to encode a protein with 94% identity to RapD, a
response regulator aspartate phosphatase acting as a transcriptional activator involved in the regulation of sporulation [24].
The conjugative functions of pAW63 are grouped in a 42
kb tra region
All 15 CDSs assigned putative conjugative functions were
found to be located within a 42 kb region of the plasmid
(CDS 1 to 26 and 62 to 76; hereafter referred to as the tra
region). Every one of the 41 CDSs predicted within this
region was in the same counter-clockwise orientation,
suggesting an operon-style transcription scheme may be
in place, which would be consistent with the genetic
organization of most known conjugative systems [25].
pAW63 encodes three homologs of Gram-negative T4SS
components
Three CDSs were found to encode proteins with significant similarity to components of the Vir secretion system,
originally characterized in Agrobacterium tumefaciens,
which is the archetypal model for the Type IV Secretion
System (T4SS) that is believed to carry out the conjugative
process in Gram-negative bacteria, as recently reviewed

[8,26]. Briefly, the T4SS can be summarized as a two-step
mechanism [27] which involves the replication of the
plasmid DNA by effector proteins followed by the translocation of a single-stranded molecule across the cell envelope into the recipient cell. The transfer is powered by the
action of a molecular pump and the DNA is thought to
travel through a channel formed by a core protein complex, while the necessary close cell-to-cell contact is mediated by surface structures.
Analysis of the pAW63 sequence (Fig. 1) showed that
CDSs 14 and 15 were in fact the two halves of an interrupted CDS encoding a homolog of the VirD4 component, which has been shown to function as a coupling
protein between the DNA strand replication machinery
and the transmembrane transfer complex and powerhouse. Interestingly, the 935 bp space between them was
found to be completely devoid of coding sequences and
showed a distinctly higher G+C content than was considered average for the rest of the plasmid. CDS 9 displayed
37% identity with VirB4, a membrane associated N-triphosphatase which is thought to play a role in providing
the energy needed to power the actual DNA transfer. CDS
22 displayed 35% identity to VirB11, a subunit implicated
in both Type II and Type IV secretion systems that was
shown to be necessary for conjugation, although its exact
role remains unclear. Structural analyses have shown it to
possess a transmembrane domain as well as an ATPase
domain, and recent research suggests that the subunits are
arranged as a dynamic hexameric assembly associated
with the inner membrane and functioning as a gating
component [28].
pAW63 encodes homologs to components of Gram-positive
conjugation systems from diverse species
Another 10 CDSs were classified as conjugative on the
basis of their homologies, this time to genes from Grampositive conjugation systems. Most notably, CDS 63
showed a distinctly high G+C content and was found to
encode a topoisomerase displaying 45% identity to the
TrsI/TraI protein from the Lactococcus lactis conjugative
plasmid pMRC01 [12]. This component of the lactococcal
conjugative system is thought to function as a relaxase, a
role equivalent to that of VirD2 in the T4SS machinery.

CDSs 67 and 70 both displayed significant homology to
LtrC-like (from the Lactococcal transfer ORF C) putative
conjugative elements from Streptococcus, Staphylococcus,
Lactococcus and Listeria species (with an average 30% identity), although they had different 'most relevant BLAST
hits', as shown in Table 1. The function of the LtrC element itself, which was identified in the tra region of the
lactococcal conjugative plasmid pRS01 [29], has not yet
been determined.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/103

CDSs 6 and 8 were predicted to be the two halves of an
interrupted protein with significant resemblance to ORF
14 from the enterococcal conjugative transposon Tn916, a
self-transmissible molecule encoding tetracycline resistance [30]. The function of Tn916 CDS 14 has not yet been
elucidated, but further results of the similarity search displaying comparable identity levels included a soluble lytic
murein transglycosylase from E. faecium as well as the
invasion-associated extracellular protein Iap from L.
monocytogenes.
Furthermore, three CDSs (CDS 13, 16 and 26) were predicted to encode proteins that may be involved in the
establishment of intimate cell-to-cell contact, either as
aggregation substances secreted into the medium, or as
cell surface determinants. CDS 13 showed a distinctly
high G+C content in its second half, which contained two
tracts of distinct repeated units that were predicted to correspond to a series of helix-turn-helix motifs followed by
a series of pleated sheets in the protein product. It also displayed 25% identity with the adhesin AidA from the Type
V secretory pathway of E. faecium, which relies on an
autotransporter system for cytolysin secretion. The
adhesin itself is primarily implicated in the pheromonemediated enterococcal mating process as an aggregation
substance, but it has also been shown to act as an adhesion factor in the course of infection of eukaryotic cells by
pathogenic E. faecalis strains and as such it may be considered a virulence determinant [31]. CDS 26 was the largest
CDS found on the plasmid (4.2 kb) and showed little significant resemblance to any known sequences except for a
positive match (20% identity) with a 3.3 kb long cell-surface protein from the B. cereus reference strain
ATCC14579 and another (23% identity) with a 2.37 kb
long Rhs family protein (for Recombination hot spot)
from Bifidobacterium longum. Rhs products are thought to
possess properties typical of cell surface proteins and
often present internal rearrangements that lead to antigenic variation [32]. CDS 16 was unlike any known bacterial sequences (apart from those of plasmids pBT9727 and
pXO2) but the putative 643 residue protein was predicted
to have a secondary structure consisting essentially of
hydrophilic helices, suggesting it may function as a surface-associated or free-acting aggregation substance.
Finally, the remaining CDSs correspond to ATPases predicted to be involved in segregation and DNA repair
(CDSs 3, 10, 62 and 76), as well as a predicted membranebound hydrolase (CDS 68).
pAW63 and mobile genetic elements
Five CDSs were readily identified as mobile genetic elements on the basis of their homologies. Standing apart
from the other four by both character and location, CDS
7 was found positioned right between the two fragments

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:103

of the interrupted Tn916 ORF 14-like element and displaying 44% identity to IepA, a group II intron-encoded
protein from Bacillus megaterium which further BLAST
results revealed to be a reverse transcriptase and maturase.
This immediately led to the conclusion that CDS 7 was
part of a group II intron that had inserted itself in the
uninterrupted ancestor of CDSs 6 and 8, a finding supported by the skewed G+C content profile corresponding
to the site of the proposed insertion. The element was tentatively named B.th.I1 (for B. thuringiensis Intron #1). Furthermore, a closer examination of the 935 bp fragment of
seemingly non-coding DNA with high G+C content found
interrupting the VirD4 homolog (CDSs 14 and 15)
revealed that the extremities of this insert were nearly
identical to those of the B.th.I1 intron mentioned above,
indicating the presence in this locus of a second retroelement presumably derived from the first. This second element was tentatively named B.th.I2 (for B. thuringiensis
Intron #2).
Three other of these CDSs (CDS 58, 60 and 61) were
found in close proximity to each other by the regulation
side of the proposed 'control center' region, as mentioned
previously, and were predicted to encode various types of
DNA recombinases.
Finally, CDS 45 was found flanking the replication side of
the replication control center and showing similarity to a
prophage helix-turn-helix protein from the B. cereus
strains G9241 and ATCC 14579. The 10 kb region downstream of CDS 45 was found to encode 18 rather short
CDSs (≈300 bp on average) with no significant homologies in a configuration reminiscent of typical bacteriophage gene structure, which may correspond to a
prophage integrated within the plasmid sequence.
Intriguingly, while the first 4 kb of this region showed a
G+C content in accordance with the rest of the plasmid,
the following 6 kb segment showed a distinctly low G+C
content along most of its length.
As a counterpoint to the considerable amount of phagederived genetic material tentatively identified on the
plasmid, CDS 66 displayed significant similarity to AbiQ,
a single-protein abortive infection mechanism from L. lactis which limits phage dissemination by shutting down
the lytic cycle and leading the infected host cells to their
death [33].
pAW63 shares a common backbone with pXO2 from B.
anthracis and pBT9727 from B. thuringiensis konkukian
Similarities between pAW63 and the virulence plasmid
pXO2 from B. anthracis had been observed previously
[18,20] and further investigation (C. Kuske, pers. comm.)
had yielded thirty short sequences (400 bp long on average) corresponding to regions of pAW63 which had been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/103

shown to hybridize to pXO2. This data was used in this
study as the basis for the sequencing of pAW63, in a strategy that involved the outlining of a backbone sequence
from which primers pairs were designed to amplify and
individually sequence the intervening regions.
These premises had guaranteed at least several hits to the
virulence plasmid from B. anthracis, pXO2, and the final
sequence of pAW63 certainly did not disappoint. Indeed,
a preliminary alignment of their sequences showed that
aside from a 37-kb region found only on pXO2 corresponding to the region containing the anthrax capsule
genes and associated regulatory elements, they possessed
a highly similar genetic makeup. Furthermore, the BLAST
results had also revealed the existence of a third closely
related plasmid, pBT9727, which was recently published
along with the genome sequence of its host strain B. thuringiensis serovar konkukian strain 97-27 [GenBank:NC_005957] and shows a comparable overall gene
organization and coding content to that of the other two.
These findings were consolidated by performing a BLAST
Score Ratio Analysis of the predicted proteomes of the
three plasmids, the results of which indicated a high level
of synteny, with the pAW63 and pBT9727 pair showing
the highest ratio of shared CDSs although the associated
identity percentages were the poorest. Regarding the CDSs
shared by each of these plasmids with pXO2, pBT9727
possessed the highest number of these but for the most
part pAW63 showed higher identity percentages (Tables 1
and 2). A global phylogenetic analysis was performed on
the three proteomes by systematically aligning the 42
homologous predicted proteins shared by all three plasmids together along with their most relevant common
BLAST hit result and building a tree from the four
sequences (data not shown). Results were consistent for
all quartets examined and suggested that pBT9727 had
been the first to branch off from the common ancestor,
while pAW63 and pXO2 diverged later. The detailed
alignment of the three sequences shown in Figure 2 clearly
illustrates the extent of the synteny observed between
these plasmids.
The tra region of pAW63 finds its equivalent on both
pXO2 and pBT9727, with high levels of identity and
contrasting discrete variations
Both pXO2 and pBT9727 were found to possess an
approximately 42 kb long region that was almost identical
to the tra region of pAW63 with respect to gene structure
and organization, as illustrated in Fig. 2. All of the CDSs
identified on pAW63 as possible conjugative genes were
found to have highly similar homologs on both of these
plasmids (see percentages in Tables 1 and 2), although
several displayed key differences as detailed below.

While the copy of the Tn916 CDS 14-like element present
on pAW63 had been found to be encoded by two CDSs
(CDSs 6 and 8) due to the insertion of the group II intron
B.th.I1 (see above), the corresponding homologs of this
element were uninterrupted on pBT9727 and pXO2. The
sequence comparison of these 'native' versions of the gene

with the one containing the intron allowed for the precise
site of insertion to be determined. This region of the
Tn916 CDS 14-like element was then aligned with its closest homologs as identified by BLAST search, revealing that
the insertion had taken place in a relatively well-conserved domain of the gene. This is consistent with the

Page 8 of 14

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:103

observation that group II introns target specific genes or
gene domains [34] despite the lack of experimental data
available concerning the insertion of this particular
element.
Similarly, the three plasmids possessed separate versions
of the VirD4 homolog. The CDS encoding this gene was
found to be interrupted in a distinct manner on both
pXO2 and pAW63, while it appeared to be intact on
pBT9727. As indicated previously, the pAW63-borne
homolog (CDS 14 and 15) was interrupted by the putative ORF-less group II intron B.th.I2, while the cause of the
disruption of the pXO2-borne homolog was a frameshift
due to the deletion of two nucleotides in a C-rich stretch
located at two-thirds of the original protein.
Likewise, homologs for the putative cell-surface protein
encoded by CDS 26 of pAW63 were found on both pXO2
and pBT972, albeit in two different forms. While pBT9727
was found to possess a presumably intact version of the
gene, the pXO2-borne version appeared to be disrupted
by a single nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift twothirds into the original protein. This was confirmed to be
a genuine feature and not a sequencing artifact by comparing the three available sequences of pXO2 [GenBank:NC_002146,
GenBank:NC_007323,
GenBank:NC_003981] which had identical frameshifts in
the corresponding locus.
Finally, the three homologs of the putative adhesin (CDS
13 on pAW63) were found to differ in a very interesting
way. While the first half of the protein was well conserved
in all three versions, the second half containing the
repeated motifs was almost identical between pXO2 and
pAW63, although pXO2 lacked several repetitions of the
basic units, and pBT9727 possessed completely different
basic units which nevertheless gave rise to highly similar
secondary structure predictions.
Sequence variability is highest in the replication control
center area and is associated with the presence of multiple
mobile genetic elements
The mobile DNA-based borders of the replication control
center of each plasmid were found to be comparable as
follows. The putative prophage structure bordering the
replicon (CDS 27 to 45 on pAW63) was found on all three
plasmids, although the second part of this structure was
poorly conserved, to the point of being absent from
pXO2. The other side of this region was delineated in all
three cases by variants of the site-specific recombinase
found on pAW63 (CDS 61). The area between the replicon and this recombinase was highly variable between the
three plasmids, with pAW63 featuring the most CDSs
therein (CDS 50 to 60).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/103

Regarding the regulatory elements present in this region,
it was observed that while both the putative pheromone
receptor (CDS 51) and the DNA-binding protein (CDS
52) identified on pAW63 were also present as close
homologs on the two other plasmids, the putative transcriptional activator RapD (CDS 57) was not found in any
form on either of them. On the other hand, both pBT9727
and pXO2 were found to possess almost identical copies
of two other genes that were not present on pAW63: a
homolog of the DNA-damage repair gene uvr from B. subtilis, and the gene encoding the transcriptional activator
TetR.
A recent recombination event caused pAW63 to exchange
part of its replicon
It is interesting to note that while the origin of replication
and main replication protein Rep63A (CDS 47) were
found to be highly conserved across all three plasmids, no
homologs were found for the two other replication-associated CDSs of pAW63 (CDS 48 and 49), but two CDSs of
similar size and orientation were found in equivalent
locations relative to the common backbone on each of the
other two plasmids, suggesting they share a functional
homology with the two pAW63 CDSs, despite their lack of
sequence similarity. Furthermore, these pBT9727- and
pXO2-borne pairs of CDSs were found to share a high
level of sequence identity with each other, suggesting that
the original corresponding part of the pAW63 replicon
had been exchanged for its present form at some point following the divergence of pXO2 and pAW63. In support of
this idea, a similar pattern of resemblance/difference was
observed for a series of partially palindromic iterons
present in the vicinity of the replication genes which were
previously believed to be implicated in the replication
process. While the iteron sequences found on pBT9727
and pXO2 were by no means identical, they did share similar repeated motifs that were completely different from
those identified on pAW63. The discovery of further repetitions of these various motifs as well as several additional
palindromes in key locations of the sequence have led to
the elucidation of a complex structure of palindromic
and/or iterative elements serving as node points for
recombination events that may have been responsible for
major divergences in synteny between the three plasmids
in the replicon area, as illustrated in Figure 3.
Comparative evidence supports the existence of a 37 kb
pathogenicity island (PAI) on pXO2
The 37 kb region of DNA located after the replicon on
pXO2 was found to exhibit most of the characteristics of a
bacterial pathogenicity island (PAI) as defined by Hacker
and Kaper [35]. All of the genes carried by pXO2 that are
known to play a capital role in the course of anthrax infection, such as the capsule genes, were clustered in this
region, along with the regulatory genes acpA and acpB,

which are directly associated with their expression during
the development of the pathology [36]. Furthermore, this
region had distinctive genetic properties from the rest of
the plasmid, such as a lower G+C content (30.9% against
34.3%), and more variation in the orientation and phase
of coding sequences. It was also found to be rich in
mobile genetic elements (some cryptic or defective), such
as multiple inactivated copies of the IS231 transposase
[16,37] and a vestigial class II transposon.
The comparison of the sequences flanking the proposed
PAI on pXO2 and their equivalents on pAW63 and
pBT9727, as described above (Fig. 3), revealed the existence of specific nodes consisting of iterative and/or palindromic sequences that could be held responsible for the
acquisition of the PAI region through a past recombination event, though not excluding the possibility of later
rearrangements having taken place within this region.
pXO2 and pBT9727 possess copies of Insertion Sequence
IS231L in different loci, causing a visible interruption in
synteny
The results of the three-way BLAST Score Ratio Analysis of
this complex plasmid trio highlighted a group of five
CDSs that were not present on the pAW63 sequence itself
but were shared with a high degree of similarity between
pBT9727 and pXO2. Their location was different on either
plasmid with respect to the common backbone, thus representing a significant interruption in the synteny of the

plasmids. It appeared that this small group had been previously described on pXO2 as an IS231-derived [38]
Insertion Sequence (IS) and designated IS231L [37],
although it was assumed to be incapable of autonomous
transposition due to a frameshift in the CDS encoding the
transposase. However, the copy of the IS231L element
harboured by pBT9727 was found to have an uninterrupted and therefore supposedly functional transposase,
as well as nearly perfect Inverted Repeats (IR), the canonical 20 bp boundaries of this type of mobile element
matching those of the pXO2-borne IS231L element.
Interestingly, the copy of IS231L found on pBT9727 was
found to be nested within the Tn1546-related [39] left IR
of a novel Class II transposon belonging to the Tn3 family, encoding a single cryptic CDS and tentatively named
TnBt9727. Likewise, the pXO2-borne copy of IS231L was
nested within the TnARS1-related [GenBank AY780525]
right IR of a vestigial class II transposon. No corresponding left IR was found for this element, but an IS3 family
transposase was found in close proximity to the putative
right IR, suggesting a possible structural association.
Furthermore, the presence of two other CDSs with homology to the IS231 transposase in the PAI of pXO2
prompted a search for other instances of IRs matching
those of IS231L in the vicinity of these CDSs. A well-conserved copy of the right IR was indeed discovered near the

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:103

end of the PAI beside a second CDS encoding an IS231
transposase-like gene (Fig. 2).

Discussion
A large proportion of the pAW63 sequence was observed
to possess significant similarity to plasmids originating
from several different bacterial species harbouring fundamentally different conjugative and replication systems.
The resulting hybrid combination of genes probably
opens up the mating scope of the plasmid. The physical
arrangement of the plasmid was identified as a composite
structure consisting of a 42 kb tra region encoding conjugation functions, organised in typical operon fashion, and
an 8 kb control center encoding the replication and regulation functions, joined by mobile genetic elements or
remains thereof (Fig. 1).
Analysis of the replication control center of pAW63
revealed that it possessed copy control proteins similar to
those found on the enterococcal conjugative pheromone
plasmids pAD1 and pCF10. However, pAW63 conjugative
transfer among B. thuringiensis strains has been shown to
be independent from recipient-encoded pheromones
[15]. It has been suggested that in addition to their role in
the transfer process, host-produced pheromones may play
a role in the replication of the pAD1 and pCF10 plasmids
[23]. Given a similar copy control mechanism, the apparent independence of pAW63 from pheromone signalling
may account for the greater host range of pAW63 compared to pAD1 and pCF10, by removing the requirement
for a compatible pheromone system in the recipient mating partner. It was therefore very interesting to find near
the pAW63 replicon two CDSs respectively encoding an
ABC transporter-type pheromone receptor, homologous
to those found in Enterococcus and Listeria species, and a
close homolog of RapD, a transcriptional activator from
B. thuringiensis serovar morrisoni. At this point it is unclear
whether the function of these elements is restricted to
either the plasmid copy control or the regulation of conjugation, or whether these processes are directly linked by
common regulatory pathway components. Nonetheless,
the presence of a putative pheromone-sensing mechanism
on pAW63 suggests that the conjugative transfer process
of the plasmid may follow alternate or optionally additive
regulatory pathways depending on the species of the mating cells.
Regarding basic conjugative function, the presence on the
plasmid of genes related to the T4SS system corroborates
similar findings [40] concerning the transfer system of the
streptococcal plasmid pIP501, which bears a tra region
containing VirD4, VirB4 and Vir B11 homologs. Interestingly, all three of the pAW63 and pIP501 T4SS-like proteins correspond to components of the system that
operate within the cell or in association with the inner

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/103

membrane to prepare the plasmid DNA for transfer and
provide motor function, and no homologs have been
found on the plasmid to the 'outer' components. This
could be explained by the idea that the inner part of the
Gram-positive cell wall structure is sufficiently similar to
that of the Gram-negative hosts for some of the 'inner'
components, designated as effector and transporter molecules, of both transfer systems to share their main characteristics and possibly a common evolutionary history
derived from replication mechanisms. Conversely, it
seems reasonable to assume that major differences in the
cell wall structure and composition, such as the presence
of a thick peptidoglycan layer and the absence of an outer
membrane, would be mirrored by the presence of specific
protein components responsible for the 'external' steps of
the conjugative process. This includes sensing of recipients, cell to cell attachment and the bridging of cell walls
to effect DNA transfer, and requires the assembly of a core
complex as well as cell surface structures. With respect to
the latter, several putative cell surface- or membrane-associated proteins, such as the adhesin encoded by CDS 13
and the very large protein encoded by CDS 26, have
already been identified in the tra region of pAW63,
although further studies will be necessary to work out
their specific roles in the conjugative process.
The presence of introns B.th.I1 and B.th.I2 within two
genes of which at least one (the VirD4 homolog) may be
considered essential to the conjugative process, poses the
question of the functionality of the interrupted genes, as
well as that of possible collateral effects caused by these
elements. Regarding maintenance of functionality of the
host genes, current models of group II intron splicing as
well as experimental research show that intron excision
during transcription leads to the production of a complete
and functional protein [41]. In addition, this type of
mobile element is thought to insert preferentially into certain conjugative genes such as relaxases, and it has been
suggested that such an insertion actually enhances the efficiency of the conjugative system [34,42]. Furthermore, the
relationship between B.th.I1, which encodes its own
reverse transcriptase, and B.th.I2, which does not,
deserves further investigation. While such a configuration
has rarely been observed among eubacteria, ORF-less
introns that were closely related to an intron encoding a
reverse transcriptase located in the same genome have
been identified in cyanobacteria and archeae [43]. It has
been proposed that these CDS-less elements were derivatives of their 'complete' RT-encoding relatives [44]. Significantly, several of these 'degenerate' elements were shown
to be mobile, raising the possibility that mobility may be
supplied in trans [41] as is the case for the Mobile Insertion Cassette MIC231 trans-activated by IS231 transposase [37,45].

The comparison of the tra regions of pAW63, pBT9727
and pXO2 has provided several valuable indications on
the relative importance of specific genes in the conjugative
process. While pAW63 is known to be fully functional and
quite efficient as a conjugative plasmid, pXO2 is believed
to be incapable of autonomous transfer although it has
been shown to be mobilizable by the conjugative plasmid
pXO14 from B. thuringiensis toumanoffi [46], suggesting
that pXO2 carries a set of conjugative genes that is incomplete or disrupted in one or several key components. Both
pXO2 and the newly sequenced plasmid pBT9727 were
now shown to possess a set of potential conjugation genes
closely related to those of pAW63. The transfer capabilities of pBT9727 have not yet been assayed, but its
sequence features point towards partial conjugative function at the very least, and possibly full self-transmissibility. For these reasons, further studies will focus on loci
exhibiting discrete variations in order to expose their specific contribution to the transfer process. For instance, the
unique interruptions found in the pXO2 homolog of the
VirD4 element and in that of the putative cell surface protein encoded by CDS 26 on pAW63 may prove to be particularly significant, especially if pBT9727 is shown to be
fully conjugative.
From a broader point of view, the combination of the
phylogenetic analysis of the three proteomes with the elucidation of the structural features delineating the major
sequence differences in the replication control center has
made it possible to roughly reconstruct the molecular evolution of the plasmid trio. The revelation that pBT9727
was the first to diverge from the common stem, leaving
pXO2 and pAW63 to branch off from an intermediate
form some time later, carries several important implications for the ecology of the B. cereus s.l. family. At a very
basic level, it highlights the mixed lineage of these plasmids, as attested by their distinct genetic properties (conjugation versus virulence) contrasting with the nearly
perfect conservation on all three of the minireplicon of
pXO2 [47]; plasmids which were isolated from strains
that are treated quite differently, namely as a biopesticide
versus a dangerous pathogen. This is particularly relevant
in the light of recent incidents linking B. cereus sensu stricto
strains to cases of anthrax-like pathologies [21,48,49], as
well as the discovery that the cereulide genetic determinants of emetic B. cereus are located on a plasmid [7,50].
Most significantly, it makes a strong case for the pXO2
capsule genes region to be officially designated a pathogenicity island, a hypothesis further validated by the structural features typical of mature PAIs that were identified in
this study. The recognition of pXO2 as a PAI-equipped virulence plasmid would also be consistent with the observation that most of the major known pathogens possess
such PAIs, many of these carried by virulence plasmids,
and it would put pXO2 on par with pXO1, which is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/103

known to carry its own anthrax toxin-bearing PAI. In addition, it should be noted that the configuration of IS231related IRs observed on pXO2 (Fig. 2), which is quite
likely due to the insertion of the IS231L element into the
PAI after its acquisition by pXO2, entails that a region representing almost the entire PAI, containing all the capsule
genes and their associated regulatory elements, can technically be considered an IS231-derived Mobile Insertion
Cassette (MIC). As such, this cassette could undergo a
transposition event provided a functional IS231 transposase is supplied in trans. Incidentally, this opportunity
for virulence genes to be directly mobilized by a mobile
genetic element from within a larger PAI is paralleled in
pXO1 by the presence in its PAI of a Class II transposon,
TnXO1, which carries the anthrax germination operon
gerX as its passenger genes [51].

Methods
Bacterial isolates and PCR amplification
B. thuringiensis strain HD73 containing pAW63 was grown
in liquid LB medium at 30°C. 1 ml cultures grown overnight were centrifuged into a pellet, washed twice in
ddH20 and resuspended in 250 µl ddH20. Freshly prepared aliquots of 5 µl of resuspended cell solution were
used as template in each subsequent 50 µl PCR reaction.
PCR amplification was performed using 'Hi-Fi polymerase mix' from Fermentas according to the manufacturer's
specifications. For target fragments of over 3 kb it was necessary to adjust the MgCl2 concentration of the reaction
mix as well as adding dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to optimize yield and specificity. Further details can be obtained
upon request. Cloning procedures made use of One Shot®
TOP10 Electrocomp™ E. coli from Invitrogen, and transformation was performed according to the manufacturer's
specifications.
Sequencing strategy
The sequencing strategy took advantage of the previously
observed similarity between pAW63 and the virulence
plasmid pXO2 from B. anthracis [18,20]. Further investigation (C. Kuske, pers. comm.) yielded thirty short
sequences (400 bp long on average) corresponding to
regions of pAW63 which had been shown to hybridize to
pXO2. This data was used to construct a backbone
sequence on the basis of which primer pairs could be
designed to amplify the intervening regions. The resulting
amplicons were purified on gel using Qiagen QiaQuick
Gel Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's specifications. Amplicons smaller than 5 kb were directly
sequenced from the purified PCR sample, those between
5 and 10 kb were cloned into sequencing vectors, and
those larger than 10 kb were each subcloned into separate
libraries. All cloning procedures were performed using the
Topo XL PCR cloning kit of Invitrogen according to the
manufacturer's specifications. Amplicons were individu-

ally sequenced at the Flanders Interuniversity Institute for
Biotechnology (VIB) Genetic Service Facility by double
strand primer walking following standard procedures
with a final accuracy of 99.98% per amplicon. The primary assembly of individual amplicon sequences was performed using the Seqman software package. The overall
assembly quality was improved by sequencing regions of
minimum 500 bp in length overlapping the extremities of
adjoining amplicons using the same protocol as described
above.

Sequence analysis and annotation
The full assembly of the amplicons, overlapping fragments and the previously published pAW63 replicon was
done manually using the Accelrys DS Gene sequence editor. The coordinate start of the sequence was assigned
with respect to that of pXO2 in order to facilitate future
comparative analyses between the two plasmids, for
which the B. anthracis 'Ames Ancestor' strain sequence of
pXO2 was used [GenBank:NC_007323]. Potential coding
regions were predicted with the prokaryotic gene finder
EasyGene [52] using a hidden Markov model (HMM) pretrained on the B. anthracis genome. Sequence similarity
searches, alignments and further annotation were performed using the BioPerl open software package with
standard default BLAST X and ClustalW parameters
(details available on request). The BLAST score ratio analysis (BSRA) was performed as described by Rasko et al.
[53]. Protein analyses were done using Accelrys DS Gene.
Proteome phylogeny analyses were performed using the
Tree Building Method (Neighbor Joining, uncorrected) in
Accelrys DS Gene. All figures included in this work were
generated using the BioPython, GenomeDiagram and
ReportLab open software packages. The complete
sequence of pAW63 has been deposited in the GenBank
database under the accession number DQ025752 [GenBank: DQ025752].
