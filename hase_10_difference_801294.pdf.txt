Difference in gene duplicability may explain the
difference in overall structure of protein-protein
interaction networks among eukaryotes
Takeshi Hase1, Yoshihito Niimura1*, Hiroshi Tanaka1,2

Abstract
Background: A protein-protein interaction network (PIN) was suggested to be a disassortative network, in which
interactions between high- and low-degree nodes are favored while hub-hub interactions are suppressed. It was
postulated that a disassortative structure minimizes unfavorable cross-talks between different hub-centric functional
modules and was positively selected in evolution. However, by re-examining yeast PIN data, several researchers
reported that the disassortative structure observed in a PIN might be an experimental artifact. Therefore, the
existence of a disassortative structure and its possible evolutionary mechanism remains unclear.
Results: In this study, we investigated PINs from the yeast, worm, fly, human, and malaria parasite including four
different yeast PIN datasets. The analyses showed that the yeast, worm, fly, and human PINs are disassortative while
the malaria parasite PIN is not. By conducting simulation studies on the basis of a duplication-divergence model,
we demonstrated that a preferential duplication of low- and high-degree nodes can generate disassortative and
non-disassortative networks, respectively. From this observation, we hypothesized that the difference in degree
dependence on gene duplications accounts for the difference in assortativity of PINs among species. Comparison
of 55 proteomes in eukaryotes revealed that genes with lower degrees showed higher gene duplicabilities in the
yeast, worm, and fly, while high-degree genes tend to have high duplicabilities in the malaria parasite, supporting
the above hypothesis.
Conclusions: These results suggest that disassortative structures observed in PINs are merely a byproduct of
preferential duplications of low-degree genes, which might be caused by an organism’s living environment.

Background
Large-scale data of protein-protein interactions have
become available from several organisms, including
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast; [1-4]), Caenorhabditis
elegans (worm; [5]), Drosophila melanogaster (fly; [6]),
Homo sapiens (human; [7,8]), and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria parasite; [9]). In a protein-protein
interaction network (PIN), a protein and an interaction
between two proteins are represented as a node and a
link, respectively. The number of links connected to a
node is called a degree. The degree distribution P(k)
represents the fraction of k-degree nodes in a network
and characterizes the structure of a network. It is well

known that various biological, technological, and
social networks are scale-free networks, in which P(k)
follows a power law, i.e., P(k) ~ k-g [10-12]. In a scalefree network, therefore, most of the nodes have low
degrees, but a small number of high-degree nodes
(hubs) also exist. In the case of PINs, P(k) better fits
a power law with an exponential cut-off, i.e.,
P ( k ) ~ ( k0 + k )

e − k / k c [13,14].

A correlation between degrees of two nodes connected
by a link is another feature characteristic of a network
architecture. A simple way to see the degree correlation
is to consider the Pearson correlation coefficient r of the
degrees at both ends of a link [12,15,16]. A network is
called as assortative when r > 0, while it is disassortative
when r < 0. In an assortative network, hubs are preferentially connected to other hubs, whereas in a disassortative

network, hubs tend to attach to low-degree nodes. It was
reported that social networks such as coauthorships of
scientific papers or film actor collaborations are assortative, whereas technological and biological networks
including Internet, food web, neural network, and PIN
are disassortative [16].
Assortativity of a network can also be evaluated by
<Knn(k)>, the mean degree among the neighbors of all
k-degree nodes ("nn” in <Knn (k)> represents “nearest
neighbors"; [12,14,17,18]). In assortative and disassortative networks, <K nn (k)> follows an increasing and
decreasing functions of k, respectively. If there are no
degree correlations, <Knn(k)> is independent of k, <Knn
(k)> = <k2>/<k>[12]. Several studies reported that the
yeast PIN is a disassortative network showing <Knn(k)>
~ k-ν [12,14,17], where ν represents the extent of disassortative structure. In the yeast PIN, therefore, links
between a hub and a low-degree node are favored, but
those between hubs are suppressed. From this observation, Maslov and Sneppen [17] suggested a picture that,
in the yeast PIN, a hub forms a functional module of
the cell together with many low-degree neighbors. They
hypothesized that the suppression of interactions
between hubs minimizes unfavorable cross-talks
between different functional modules and increases the
robustness of a network against perturbations. Therefore, it is postulated that the disassortative structure in
the yeast PIN has been favored by natural selection.
Note that, if this hypothesis is true, a disassortative
structure should be a general feature that is commonly
observed among PINs in any organisms.
To understand the evolutionary mechanisms shaping
PIN architectures, several network growth models have
been proposed. Many of them are based on gene duplication and divergence, in which a randomly selected
node is duplicated to generate a new node having the
same links as the original node, and some links are
added or eliminated in a divergence process [19-23]. We
have recently proposed a non-uniform heterodimerization (NHD) model [14]. In this model, a new link is preferentially attached between two duplicated nodes to
create a cross-interaction when they share many common neighbors. We showed that this model can the
best reproduce structural features of the yeast PIN,
including scale-freeness, a small number of cross-interactions, and a skewed distribution of triangles composed
of three nodes and three links. However, this model as
well as other duplication-divergence models [21,22]
failed to explain the presence of a disassortative structure in the yeast PIN. Simulation studies showed that
these models could generate a decreasing function of
<Knn(k)>, yet the value of ν (0.18) in <Knn(k)> ~ k-ν is
much smaller than the actual value (0.47; see Tables 1
and 2). Therefore, the origin of a disassortative structure

Page 3 of 15

still remains unexplained. We should again note that
most of these simulation studies were carried out by
using the yeast PIN only, because it is currently the best
characterized.
It is well-known that large-scale PIN data contain
many false positive interactions [24]. Maslov and Sneppen [17] used a dataset obtained by high-throughput
yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens [2] to show suppression
of interactions between high-degree nodes. Aloy and
Russell [25], however, argued that the observed suppression of hub-hub interactions is probably an artifact
caused by a systematic error in the Y2H data due to
prey-bait asymmetry (see also Maslov and Sneppen
[26]). To circumvent the problem of high false positive
rates in high-throughput datasets, Batada et al. [27] used
only interactions that were independently reported at
least twice in different datasets, and they found that
hub-hub interactions were not suppressed in the multivalidated yeast PIN data. However, Hakes et al. [28]
pointed out that multiple validation introduces another
problem: interactions observed at least twice will be
biased towards well-studied proteins, such as those from
particular cellular environments or highly expressed
ones. They showed that assortativity of a PIN drastically
changes depending on datasets [28]. A literature-curated
yeast PIN dataset [29], which is expected to be reliable
because each of the interaction data was derived from
small-scale experiments, showed a disassortative structure; however, when they retained only interactions
observed twice or three times, it became rather assortative [28]. Therefore, the presence of a disassortative
structure in a PIN itself has now become controversial.
These studies suggest that a global structure of a PIN
has to be investigated by using various datasets obtained
from different methods.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the presence of disassortative structures in PINs and an evolutionary mechanism shaping disassortative structures, if
any. For this purpose, we examined eukaryotic PINs
from the yeast, worm, fly, human, and malaria parasite.
We analyzed four large-scale yeast PIN datasets (MIPS
[3]; Yu et al. [4]; Reguly et al. [29]; Batada et al. [30]).
The datasets include Batada et al.’s updated version of a
multi-validated dataset, Reguly et al.’s comprehensive literature-curated dataset, and MIPS [3], which has been
called a “gold standard” of yeast protein interaction
dataset generated by manual curations by experts. We
also used recently published high-quality protein interaction data by Yu et al. [4], which were obtained by
compiling several Y2H datasets. In addition, we examined two independent human PIN datasets (Rual et al.
[7]; Stelzl et al. [8]). As a result, we show that the yeast,
worm, fly, and human PINs have disassortative structures, while malaria parasite PIN is not disassortative.

We then propose a possible evolutionary mechanism
causing the difference in assortativity among species.

Results
In this study, we examined nine PIN datasets from
yeast, worm, fly, human, and malaria parasite (Table 1).
Although the numbers of nodes and links are quite different among the five species, their degree distributions
P(k) follow nearly the same curve (Figure 1 and additional file 1: Figure S1). All of the PINs examined are
scale-free, suggesting that scale-freeness is a general feature of PINs. These observations are consistent with
Suthram et al. [31].
On the other hand, a disassortative structure was not
commonly observed among PINs. Although <K nn (k)>
for the yeast, worm, fly, or human PIN is a decreasing
function following k-ν, the malaria parasite PIN is not
disassortative (Figure 2A and additional file 2: Figure
S2). Note that all of the four yeast PIN datasets showed
a disassortative structure regardless of the controversy
on the presence of hub-hub suppression (see additional
file 2: Figure S2; see Discussion). The values of ν for the
eight PINs in yeast, worm, fly, and human examined are
significantly non-zero (P < 3×10-4), while the value of ν
for the malaria parasite PIN is not significantly different
from zero (P ~ 0.27). The difference in ν between the
malaria parasite PIN and each of the other eight PINs is
also significant (P < 1×10-3; analysis of covariance). In
agreement with these observations, the correlation coefficient r between degrees of connected nodes in the
yeast, worm, fly, or human PIN is negative, while that in
the malaria parasite PIN is nearly zero (Table 1).

process, a randomly selected node is duplicated to generate a new node having the same links as the original
node, followed by a divergence process in which some
links are eliminated. If a low-degree node A is duplicated
to generate a new node A’ (Figure 2B, right), the value of
ν in a network increases, because a degree of a node (C)
connected to a low-degree node increases. On the other
hand, duplication of a high-degree node (C) causes the
value of ν to decrease, because a degree of a node (A)
connected to a high-degree node increases (Figure 2B,
left). Therefore, we can hypothesize that duplications of
low- and high-degree nodes in a disassortative network
have an effect to make the value of ν larger and smaller,
respectively.
To examine this issue in more detail, we developed a
new duplication-divergence model named the degreedependent duplication (DDD) model by modifying the
NHD model that we proposed previously [14]. In the
DDD model, a duplication of a node occurs depending
on its degree. In a duplication process, a randomly
selected node is duplicated with a probability proportional to 1 + sk, where k is the degree of the node, and
s is a parameter determining the duplicability of the
node (see Methods for details).
As for a divergence process, we examined two different models, the asymmetric divergence and the symmetric divergence (Figure 3). In the former, the removal

Page 6 of 15

of links occurs in only one of the duplicated nodes,
while in the latter, links are lost from both of the duplicates with an equal probability. In this study, we conducted simulations using four different models: NHD
with the asymmetric and symmetric divergence, which
is referred to as NHD+A and NHD+S, respectively, and
DDD with the asymmetric and symmetric divergence
(DDD+A and DDD+S, respectively) (Table 2).
Simulation studies showed that the value of ν
increases (the slope becomes steeper) as s decreases for
both DDD+A and DDD+S (Figure 2C). We found that
the disassortative structures of the yeast (MIPS), worm,
and fly PINs were successfully reproduced by DDD+A
and DDD+S when the values of s are negative (Table 2,
additional file 3: Figure S3). The human (Rual et al.)
PIN was best regenerated by DDD+S with s = 0. Note
that, although s = 0 means no degree-dependency of
duplicability, where the DDD model becomes identical
to the NHD model, the resultant network is still disassortative (Figure 2C). Therefore, in order to generate a
network similar to the malaria parasite PIN, the value of
s has to be positive, i.e., high-degree nodes should be
duplicated more preferentially than low-degree nodes. In
fact, our analysis showed that the assortativity of the
malaria parasite PIN was reproduced by the DDD
model with a positive s (see Table 2 and additional file
3: Figure S3E).

Figure 3 Degree-dependent duplication (DDD) model. In the DDD model, the probability of a duplication of a node is dependent on the
degree of the node. In the network at the left, node A is duplicated to generate node A’ with the probability of (1 + 4s)/1,000, because the
degree of node A is four (see Methods). In the asymmetric divergence, each of the links to node A’ is removed with a uniform probability a in
the divergence process (top, second column). In the symmetric divergence, one of the two duplicated links (e.g. either A-B link or A’-B link) to
each node connecting to A and A’ (nodes B-E) is eliminated with a probability a (bottom, second column). A new link between nodes A and A’
is attached with the probability proportional to the number of common neighbors (nN) shared by these nodes (third column). In this case, the
probability is 2b, because these nodes share two common neighbors (nodes C and D).

b. Parameters used in the simulations. See Methods.

The effect of link gains after gene duplication was also
investigated. However, random attachments of links to
duplicated nodes do not essentially affect the assortativity of resultant networks (additional file 4: Figure S4).
We also examined the average shortest path length,
<L> and the extent of modularity, M in PINs (Table 1)
and simulation-generated networks (Table 2). In agreement with our previous study [14], the values of <L> in
the networks by NHD+A are larger than the actual
values in PINs for all species. DDD+A gave the <L>
values that are slightly closer to the actual values than
NHD+A. On the other hand, for both NHD and DDD
models, the symmetric divergence generated networks
having larger values of <L>. It was reported that PINs
are highly modular [32], but simulation-generated networks showed even higher values of M than the PINs
(Table 2). Moreover, when we compare four networks
generated by different models for each species, the value
of M is positively correlated with that of <L>, which is
consistent with Zhang and Zhang [33].
To see whether the difference in duplicability dependent on degrees accounts for the difference in assortativity, we analyzed orthologous relationships using
proteomes in 55 eukaryote species. Wapinski et al. [34]
provided data of orthologous relationships among 19
Ascomycota fungi including S. cerevisiae. In their

dataset, all proteins in these 19 species are classified
into ortholog groups, each of which consists of the proteins descended from a single ancestral protein in their
most recent common ancestor. To evaluate the duplicability of a given gene in S. cerevisiae, we examined
orthologous relationships between S. cerevisiae and each
of the other 18 Ascomycota fungi. A phylogenetic tree
was constructed using orthologous genes from the two
species, and the number of gene duplication events
observed in the phylogenetic tree was regarded as a
duplicability of the gene (see Methods). In the same
manner, we also evaluated gene duplicability in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, H. sapiens, and P. falciparum
using other databases (see Methods).
Figure 4 and additional file 5: Figure S5 indicate the relationships between the degree and the duplicability. We
classified all proteins in each PIN into three categories
containing similar numbers of proteins: low- (k = 1), middle- (k = 2 - 6), and high- (k > 6) degree proteins. The
results showed that the duplicability of low- and middledegree proteins is significantly higher than that of highdegree proteins in the yeast and worm PINs (Figure 4 and
additional file 5: Figure S5). The same trend was also
observed in the fly PIN. In contrast, the duplicability of
low- and middle-degree proteins is significantly lower
than that of high-degree proteins in the malaria parasite

PIN, while no clear trends were observed in the human
PIN (Figure 4). These observations are consistent with the
above hypothesis; i.e., the differences in degree-dependent
duplicability of genes account for the difference in assortativity among species.
We also investigated the differences in degrees and
duplicabilities among different functional categories in
yeast and malaria parasite proteins. Table 3 shows the
mean degree and the mean duplicability of yeast proteins
belonging to each category obtained from the GO (gene
ontology) slim database in the Saccharomyces Genome
Database [3]. Interestingly, genes in several categories
with significantly higher (lower) degrees on average
showed significantly lower (higher) duplicabilities.

A similar analysis was conducted for malaria parasite
proteins using the GO in the PlasmoDraft database [35]
(Table 4). In this case, functional categories with high
(low) degrees tend to show high (low) duplicabilities
(additional file 6: Figure S6), which is an opposite trend
to that observed in yeast proteins. The slopes in the
degree-duplicability relationships are significantly different between the yeast and malaria parasite PINs (P <
0.01; analysis of covariance).

parasite PIN is not disassortative. Therefore, a disassortative structure is not a common feature of PINs. By
comparing proteomes and conducting simulations, we
demonstrated that the difference in assortativity can
well be explained by assuming that the duplicability of
proteins is dependent on its degree and the dependency
is different among species. If low-degree proteins have
preferentially duplicated in evolution as in yeast, worm,
and fly, or there is no trend in the duplicability between
low- and high-degree proteins as in the human, the PIN
becomes disassortative. On the other hand, a PIN without a disassortative structure could be generated if highdegree proteins have preferentially duplicated as in
malaria parasite. Therefore, for explaining the presence
of a disassortative structure in PINs, the “selectionist
view” as proposed by Maslov and Sneppen [17] is not
necessary. It is rather likely that a disassortative structure observed in PINs is merely a byproduct of preferential duplications of low-degree proteins.
Although several authors [25,27] claimed that the suppression of hub-hub interactions may be an artifact, our
analyses using four recently published high-quality yeast

PIN datasets demonstrated that all of the four PINs are
in fact disassortative. In Batada et al. [27], they mentioned that the interactions between hubs are not suppressed, where a hub was defined as a node with k > 21
(top 10% of the nodes). However, the same data showed
that the interactions between nodes with relatively high
degrees (20 <k < 30) and those with very high degrees
(k > 50) are suppressed and interactions between lowdegree nodes (k < 3) and high-degree nodes (k > 50) are
favored. Therefore, Batada et al.’s data [27] is not inconsistent with the presence of a disassortative structure.
Moreover, the updated version [30] of their multivalidated yeast PIN data clearly showed disassortativity
(see additional file 2: Figure S2A). These results suggest
that a disassortative structure in the yeast PIN is not an
artifact.
Fernández [36] classified yeast proteins into several
categories on the basis of the existence of orthologous
proteins in other genomes, e.g., the proteins that are
present in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaebacteria, or
those present in other fungi. He found that an “ancient”
network consisting of proteins that are present in

Hase et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:358
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/358

diverse organisms tends to be assortative and the assortative ancient network evolved into the disassortative
PIN in yeast at the present time. To explain this evolutionary trend, Fernández [36] hypothesized a model in
which an attachment of new links between similardegree nodes is disfavored. Note that our DDD model is
also consistent with the evolutionary trend toward
higher disassortativity (see additional file 7: Figure S7).
PIN data include binary interaction information that is
directly obtained from experiments such as Y2H and
indirectly inferred from protein complex data. Wang
and Zhang pointed out that these two types of data may
give quite different images of PINs [32]. We therefore
excluded protein complex data from the MIPS database
and reexamined the yeast PIN. The result, however,
showed no significant differences in disassortativity
between PINs with and without complex data (additional file 8: Figure S8). We should also note that PINs
are a collection of potential interactions that occur at
different times in different cells or subcellular locations,
but we treated all interactions simultaneously. To see
how such treatment affects our results, we examined
yeast subnetworks constructed from the proteins in
each subcellular localization separately. As shown in
additional file 9: Figure S9, although the extent of disassortativity varies among different subcellular locations
due to smaller sample sizes, in general such subnetworks also show disassortative structures.
Neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization

It is generally thought that gene duplication is a primary
source for generating organismal complexity. Neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are proposed as a
fate of duplicated genes. Neofunctionalization hypothesizes that the presence of redundant copies of genes
allows one duplicate to be free from selective pressure,
and thus one of the duplicates can accumulate random
mutations and potentially acquire novel functions [37].
Subfunctionalization argues that each of the duplicates
accumulates degenerative mutations, resulting in the
division of ancestral functions into complementary subsets [38]. Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization contribute to protein evolution [39-42].
In the duplication-divergence model, neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are modeled as a random
attachment of new links [20] and a random loss of links
to duplicated nodes [22], respectively. Our simulation
studies showed a high rate of link losses (a > 0.5; see
Table 2), suggesting the importance of subfunctionalization. On the other hand, link gains were shown to have
only minor effects to the structure of PINs (additional
file 4: Figure S4). Altogether, our study supports a view
that subfunctionalization plays a significant role in

Page 11 of 15

shaping the structures of PINs, which is consistent with
a recent study by Gibson and Goldberg [43].
As for subfunctionalization, it has been reported that
the number of links retained after gene duplication is
considerably different between two duplicates [44]. For
this reason, several previous studies used the asymmetric divergence model [14,45-48]. However, “complete” asymmetric divergence in which links are
eliminated from only one of the duplicates is unrealistic,
and the actual situation should be between asymmetric
divergence and symmetric divergence. We have therefore conducted simulation studies using both symmetric
and asymmetric divergence models. The results, however, did not show essential differences (Table 2).
Degree-duplicability correlations

In this study, we found that lower-degree proteins tend
to duplicate more frequently in the yeast, worm, and fly
PINs (Figure 4). One caveat of this analysis is that the
degrees of proteins used in these analyses are presentday degrees and thus might be different from those
prior to duplication. Because the number of interactions
often changes greatly after duplications [19,41], the
observed degree-duplicability correlation may also be
interpreted as that degrees decrease after duplication by
divergence rather than that the duplicability itself is
dependent on a degree. However, under this interpretation, it is difficult to explain the difference in the trend
of degree-duplicability correlations among different species (Figure 4). Moreover, as mentioned above, the
duplication-divergence model without considering
degree-dependent duplicability is insufficient to explain
the extent of disassortativity in the yeast, worm, and fly
PINs.
Prachumwat and Li [49] found a positive correlation
between degree and the proportion of unduplicated proteins in the yeast proteome, which is consistent with
our results. Liang et al. [50] showed that the extent of
protein under-wrapping, which indicates the solvent
accessibility to backbone hydrogen bonds, is negatively
correlated with gene duplicability in Escherichia coli,
yeast, worm, fly, human, and Arabidopsis thaliana. They
also found that the correlation becomes weaker for
more complex organisms. It was reported that the
extent of protein under-wrapping is strongly positively
correlated with the degree of proteins in yeast [51];
therefore, their results are also consistent with ours (Figure 4). In Liang et al. [50], gene duplicability was
defined as a protein family size. In this study, we evaluated gene duplicability by directly counting the number
of gene duplication events using orthologous genes in
closely related species. Therefore, we considered more
recent gene duplications than Prachumwat and Li [49]

Hase et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:358
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/358

and Liang et al. [50]. He and Zhang showed that lowdegree nodes are less important [52] and less important
genes tend to duplicate more frequently [53]. Their
results are also consistent with ours.
Why low-degree proteins tend to be duplicated frequently in the evolution of the yeast PIN? The actual
reason is currently unclear. Yet, as indicated in Table 3,
some functional categories showed low degrees but high
duplicabilities on average, while others showed high
degrees and low duplicabilities. The former includes
metabolic processes for carbohydrates or vitamins. Marland et al. [54] reported that the duplicability of genes
involved in metabolism, especially in central metabolism,
is significantly higher than that for non-metabolic genes
in both yeast and E. coli. Moreover, most of the
enzymes involved in these metabolic processes bind
only to a specific substrate, and probably for this reason,
their degrees are relatively low. The categories showing
a high degree and a low duplicability are exemplified by
organelle organization and biogenesis, RNA metabolic
process, and transcription (see Table 3). The category
“organelle organization and biogenesis” contains many
proteins involved in the organization of actin filaments
or cytoskeletons. Actin and actin-related proteins are
known to bind many partner proteins [55]. At the same
time, they are highly conserved from yeasts to humans
[56], and therefore gene duplications of these genes are
apparently rare.
Why, then, are high-degree proteins duplicated preferentially in the evolution of the malaria parasite PIN?
Table 4 indicates that genes belonging to the categories
pathogenesis and interaction with host tend to have
high degrees and high duplicability, though the numbers
of genes in these categories are not large. These categories include many proteins of Pf erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family. PfEMP1 proteins
interact with receptors in the host and change the morphology of the host cell [57]; therefore, the duplications
of these genes would be beneficial to malaria parasites.
Moreover, a PfEMP1 protein has a feature of an adhesive molecule [58] and can bind many partner proteins.
However, the actual reason for the opposite trend of
gene duplicability in the entire PIN of malaria parasite
to that of other eukaryotes is currently unclear. It would
be intriguing to investigate the PINs of other parasitic
organisms.
These observations suggest that the duplicability of
the proteins having a given function can be different
and determined by each organism’s living environment.
The duplicability of genes for each species would, in
turn, determine the overall structure of a PIN. The
availability of high-quality interaction data from various
species including parasitic organisms will help us to
clarify the relationships between environments where

Page 12 of 15

organisms inhabit and the evolution of their PINs in
greater detail.

Conclusions
In this study, we showed that disassortative structures
are not common features among eukaryotes by examining nine different PINs from five eukaryote species. We
found that low-degree proteins tend to show high
duplicabilities for the PIN with a disassortative structure
(e.g. yeast), while an opposite trend was observed for the
PIN without disassortativity (e.g. malaria parasite). Simulation studies on the basis of gene duplication and divergence also supported these observations. Therefore, for
explaining the presence of disassortative structure, any
selective forces on the entire structure of PINs are
unnecessary. Our results indicate that overall structure
of PINs is primarily determined by local processes in
the course of evolution.
Methods
PIN and GO data

The datasets of the yeast PIN were obtained from the
MIPS (Munich Information Center for Protein
Sequences) database http://mips.gsf.de (18 May 2006)
[3], Batada et al. [30], Reguly et al. [29], and Yu et al.
[4]. Worm and Fly PIN data were obtained from Li et
al. [5] and IM Browser http://proteome.wayne.edu/
PIMdb.html[59], respectively. The datasets of the
human PIN were from Rual et al. [7] and Stelzl et al.
[8], and Malaria parasite PIN was from LaCount et al.
[9]. Some of these datasets contain components that are
not connected to each other. In these cases, we used the
largest component for the analysis. All self-interactions
were removed. The yeast GO slim dataset was downloaded from the ftp site of Saccharomyces Genome
Database ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/literature_curation/. The GO dataset for P. falciparum was
obtained from PlasmoDraft [35]. The yeast PIN excluding protein complex data was obtained from http://
www.umich.edu/~zhanglab/download.htm[32].
Modularity

PINs have a modular structure, in which interactions
between proteins are much denser within a module
than between modules [32]. The modularity m for a
particular separation of a network is calculated by
m = ∑ s =1 [(l s / L) − (k s / 2L) 2 ] , where N is the number
N

of modules, L is the number of links in a network, ls is
the number of links within module s, and ks is the sum
of the degrees of nodes in module s [60]. The separation
that maximizes m is considered to be optimal. The maximum m among all possible separation of a given network is referred to as the modularity of the network

Hase et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:358
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/358

and denoted as M. We used the method by Vincent
et al. [61] for searching the optimal separation, since the
method gives excellent accuracy for module separation
and outperforms other methods in terms of a computational time [61].
Simulation

The simulation studies were conducted using a duplication-divergence model in a similar manner to Hase et al.
[14] with a modification. In the DDD model, a new
node and new links are added to the network according
to the following rules at each time step of a simulation.
(1) A node in a network is randomly selected (A). Node
A is duplicated to generate a new node (A’) with a probability (1 + sk)/1,000 (when 1 + sk >0), where k is the
degree of node A, and s is a parameter determining the
duplicability of a node for each species. The probability
is defined to be 0 when 1 + sk is lower than 0. The
interacting pattern of node A’ is identical to that of
node A. (2) For a divergence process, two different
models were examined: the asymmetric divergence [14]
and the symmetric divergence (Figure 3). In the former,
links to node A’ is removed with a uniform probability
a. In the latter, for each of the nodes connecting to A
and A’ (e.g. node B), one of the two links (either A-B
link or A’-B link) is randomly chosen and is removed
with a probability a (Figure 3). (3) A new link between
node A and node A’ is created with a probability bnN
(when bnN ≤ 1), where nN is the number of common
neighbors shared by these two nodes. The probability is
defined to be one when bnN is greater than 1. If there
are no links to node A’ after these processes (all links to
node A’ were removed and no links were generated),
node A’ is not added to the network.
The processes (1)-(3) were repeated until the number
of nodes in a network became the same as those in the
PINs for a given species. We used various values of s, a,
and b and performed simulations. The value of s was
changed from -0.05 to 0 by 0.01 and from 0 to 10.0 by
0.1, and the values of a and b were changed from 0 to 1
by 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. For a given set of s, a,
and b, we conducted simulations 100 times. We then calculated the mean of <k> and the mean of <C> from the
100 networks. Moreover, we calculated the mean of <Knn
(k)> from the 100 networks. The value of ν represents the
slope of the regression line of the mean of <Knn(k)>. In
Table 2, the values of s, a, and b that could reproduce
<k>, <C>, and ν in each PIN are shown.
We also examined a model considering link gains. In
this model, the following process was added after the process (3) in the DDD model: A link is attached between
each of the two duplicated nodes (A and A’) and a randomly selected node with a probability ε. The value of ε
was changed from 0.01 to 0.1. s = -0.05 was used for both

Page 13 of 15

asymmetric and symmetric divergence. The values of a
and b were determined in the same way as the DDD
model.
Gene duplicability

We examined the duplicability of genes in yeast, worm,
fly, human, and malaria parasite by using orthologous
relationships among closely related species. For yeast
genes, we used the dataset of ortholog groups for 19
Ascomycota fungi including S. cerevisiae downloaded
from Fungal Orthogroups Repository http://www.broad.
mit.edu/regev/orthogroups/[34]. This dataset provides
ortholog groups, each of which consists of genes descended from a gene in the last common ancestor of 19
Ascomycota fungi. Duplicability of genes in the yeast PIN
was evaluated by considering orthologous relationships
between S. cerevisiae and each of the other 18 fungal species. Let us consider the comparison between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus, for instance. Because some
ortholog groups do not contain any genes from some of
the 19 species, we consider only ortholog groups containing at least one gene from both S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. Suppose that a given ortholog group contains two
genes from S. cerevisiae and three genes from S. paradoxus (and more from other species). We constructed a
phylogenetic tree from these five genes by the neighborjoining (NJ) method [62] using ClustalW [63]. We then
counted the number of duplication events from the tree
using Notung (ver. 2.5) [64]. This number is regarded to
be duplicabilities for both of two S. cerevisiae genes. In
this way, the value of duplicability was assigned to each
protein in the yeast PIN. Similarly, we calculated duplicability of genes contained in the worm, fly, human, and
malaria parasite PINs. For worm and malaria parasite
genes, we used OrthoMCL-DB version 2 http://orthomcl.
cbil.upenn.edu [65], which contains ortholog groups of
three nematode species including C. elegans and those of
six Haemosporidian species including P. falciparum. For
fly and human genes, we used ortholog groups of 12 Drosophila species and those of 11 vertebrate species including seven mammals, respectively, downloaded from
OrthoDB http://cegg.unige.ch/orthodb [66].

the networks generated by the NHD and DDD models. Distribution
of <Knn(k)> in the PIN (black square) and the networks by DDD+A (red
diamond), DDD+S (blue triangle), NHD+A (green cross), and NHD+S
(purple plus) for (A) yeast, (B) worm, (C) fly, (D) human, and (E) malaria
parasite. The results for the NHD and DDD models were obtained by
taking the mean among 100 networks generated by simulations. A
dashed line represents a regression line. The slope (ν) of each regression
line is shown in Table 2.
Additional file 4: Figure S4: Distribution of <Knn(k)> in the networks
generated by simulations with link gains for (A) the DDD+A and (B)
DDD+S models. ε is the probability of a link gain (see Methods). The
results were obtained by taking the mean among 100 networks
generated by simulations. A dashed line represents a regression line (ν =
0.51 and 0.48 for the asymmetric and symmetric divergence,
respectively).

and mean duplicabilities for different functional categories in (A)
yeast and (B) malaria parasite. A dot indicates each functional
category, and its size represents the number of proteins in the category.
A dashed line indicates a regression line.
Additional file 7: Figure S7: Evolutionary trend toward higher
disassortativity in the networks generated by the DDD model.
Fernández [36] categorized yeast proteins into five classes: proteins that
are present in all organisms (3.5% of the yeast proteome), in eubacteria
(9.5%), in archaebacteria but not in eubacteria (8%), in eukaryotes
diverging earlier than fungi (19%), in other fungi (36%), and exclusively in
yeast (24%). By using these fractions, we calculated the numbers of
nodes contained in ancient networks as 136, 505, 1,556, and 3,268. We
generated networks by the DDD model (asymmetric divergence) with s
= -0.05, a = 0.50, and b = 0.019, which were used for regenerating the
yeast PIN (see Table 1). For each ancient network, we calculated the
mean value of ν from 100 simulation-generated networks.

Subcellular localizations containing >100 proteins and >30 interactions
were shown.
