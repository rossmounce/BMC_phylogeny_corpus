Abstract
Background: Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a widespread condition characterized by recurring
states of mania and depression. Lithium, a direct inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3
(GSK3) activity, and a mainstay in BPD therapeutics, has been proposed to target GSK3 as a
mechanism of mood stabilization. In addition to mood imbalances, patients with BPD often
suffer from circadian disturbances. GSK3, an essential kinase with widespread roles in
development, cell survival, and metabolism has been demonstrated to be an essential
component of the Drosophila circadian clock. We sought to investigate the role of GSK3 in
the mammalian clock mechanism, as a possible mediator of lithium's therapeutic effects.
Methods: GSK3 activity was decreased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically
and pharmacologically, and changes in the cyclical expression of core clock genes – mPer2 in
particular – were examined.
Results: We demonstrate that genetic depletion of GSK3 in synchronized oscillating MEFs
results in a significant delay in the periodicity of the endogenous clock mechanism,
particularly in the cycling period of mPer2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 activity by kenpaullone, a known antagonist of GSK3
activity, as well as by lithium, a direct inhibitor of GSK3 and the most common treatment for
BPD, induces a phase delay in mPer2 transcription that resembles the effect observed with
GSK3 knockdown.
Conclusion: These results confirm GSK3 as a plausible target of lithium action in BPD
therapeutics, and suggest the circadian clock mechanism as a significant modulator of
lithium's clinical benefits.

Background
Bipolar disorder is a common, chronic, severe, and often
life-threatening illness, characterized by recurrent episodes of two diametrically opposite mood states: mania
and depression [1]. Despite clinical efforts spanning four
decades, the pathophysiology and etiology of BPD remain
unclear, in part due to the inherent genetic heterogeneity
of affective mood disorders [2]. Current consolidated
models for BPD suggest that interplay between genetic,
epigenetic, and environmental factors cause the disease
[1,3].
Modes of therapy deemed to be effective in alleviating
symptoms have been puzzling with respect to their modes
of action at the molecular, cellular, systemic and behavioural levels. Despite four decades of clinical use, and
demonstrated efficacy in reducing the frequency and
severity of recurrent affective episodes, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of lithium, a hallmark of BPD therapeutics, remain to be fully
elucidated [4,5]. The identification of the molecular target(s) of mood stabilizers would not only facilitate the
development of improved modes of treatment, but also
provide a basis for the delineation of the pathophysiology
of affective mood disorders.
Features of circadian rhythmicity represent an endophenotype that has received a significant amount of attention
[2,6]. The cyclic nature of bipolar disorder itself, and clinical features of depression such as premature early morning awakening from sleep and diurnal variation in mood,
shortened REM sleep latency, advances in hormonal and
temperature rhythms, as well as activity, highlight the
prevalence of circadian rhythm abnormalities in affected
subjects, with particular tendencies towards phase
advances and/or shortened periods [2,6-8]. It is therefore
of great consequence that lithium has been found to modify the free running period or phase of numerous synchronized behavioural, physiological, and biochemical
rhythms in various experimental settings conducted on a
phylogenetically diverse variety of organisms, including
humans [9]. Most consistent among these modifications
is the effect of period lengthening and/or phase delay.
Examples of these lithium-modified rhythms include
delayed rhythms of drinking and locomotor activity in
rodents [10,11]; as well as temperature, activity, REM
sleep latency and sleep/wake rhythms of human subjects
[12-14]. Moreover, lithium-induced period lengthening
has also been demonstrated on the pacemaking properties
of single cells, suggesting a direct modulation of the clock
mechanism [15].
GSK3, a serine/threonine kinase encoded in mammals by
two isoforms, GSK3α and GSK3β, is a direct, in vitro and
in vivo target of inhibition by lithium [16-18]. Shaggy

(Sgg), the Drosophila homologue of GSK3, plays a central
role in determining circadian period length in flies [19],
providing a compelling molecular target for the mechanistic basis of lithium's therapeutic effects. The circadian
system functions to promote the optimal temporal organization of a variety of specialized states, segregating in
time those which are mutually incompatible, thus integrating neurotransmitter, endocrine and behavioural
mechanisms whose dysregulation may be involved in the
pathophysiology of affective disorders [6]. While there are
many differences in the molecular and genetic details of
the circadian machinery in mammals and Drosophila, the
basic regulatory principles are maintained [20,21]. Central to the molecular circadian circuitry of various phylogenetically diverse organisms are the interconnected
positive and negative autoregulatory feedback loops of
transcription and translation, protein-protein interaction,
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and degradation,
whose imposed delays combine to create a molecular
cycle that approximates the ~24 hr environmental LD
period [21]. A significant determinant of period length is
the delay in the nuclear translocation of negative regulatory complexes, the timing of which is tightly regulated
[22-27]. In Drosophila, SGG was found to modulate the
nuclear localization of the TIMELESS/PERIOD inhibitory
complex, through its phosphorylation of TIM protein,
promoting nuclear translocation of the PER/TIM complex
[19]. As such, overexpression of SGG resulted in a shortening of the intrinsic period, whereas a reduction of SGG
activity had a period lengthening effect, precisely the effect
attributed to lithium on the free-running period of most
organisms studied, including Drosophila [28].
The evolutionarily conserved nature of both the circadian
molecular mechanism [21,29] and the period altering
effects of lithium led to the present investigation of the
role of GSK3 in the mammalian circadian clock. Examination of the transcriptional profiles of core clock genes in
synchronized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), following genetic or pharmacological reduction of GSK3
activity, revealed a consistent period lengthening/phase
delaying effect. Taken together, these results provide a
molecular basis for the therapeutic efficacy of lithium,
and validate GSK3 as a candidate mammalian "core"
clock gene.

Methods
Generation of stable mouse embryonic fibroblast lines with
GSK3α knockdown in a GSK3β nullizygous background
An siRNA target sequence, 5'-aaagcgtcagtcggggctatg-3',
located in the coding sequence of the N-terminal extension unique to GSK3α was identified using Ambion's
siRNA target finder [30]. Through BLAST analysis, this
sequence was determined to be unique to mouse GSK3α.
The Silencer™ Express siRNA expression cassette (SEC) kit

(Ambion) was used to create a SEC for GSK3α with oligos
directed against the GSK3α target sequence described
above. The SEC was cloned into pCR®-Blunt-II-TOPO®
(Invitrogen) and the sequence was verified. To allow for
stable cell line generation, the SEC was sub-cloned into
the unique EcoRI site of the plasmid pPUR (Clontech) to
create the plasmid pPUR_ASEC1. Immortalized MEFs
derived from GSK3β nullizygous embryos [31] were transfected with ScaI-linearized pPUR_ASEC1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection,
the cells were put under selection using 2 µg/ml puromycin (InVivogen). Puromycin-resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and tested by western blotting to
determine the level of GSK3α knockdown.
Generation of GSK3β(-/-);GSK3α(flox/-) fibroblasts
E14K mouse embryonic stem cells with LoxP-recombination sites flanking exon 2 of GSK3 (both alleles), were
made null for GSK3β through conventional gene targeting
by first replacing exon 2 with a neo cassette for positive
selection with G418 and then rendering the locus
homozygous through selection in 2.5 mg/ml G418 as previously described [32]. These GSK3β(-/-);GSK3α(flox/flox) ES
cells were injected into blastocysts derived from B6 mice
to generate chimeric embryos. A total of 14 embryos from
3 pregnant recipient mothers were harvested at day 16.5
dpc to generate separate cultures of primary mouse fibroblasts from each embryo. To select MEFs derived from the
injected ES cells, cultures were placed under selection with
1 mg/ml G418. Only 1 of the 14 pups (pup 10) gave rise
to a large number of G418-resistant MEFs, while the others yielded none. The resistant MEFs were passaged 10
times, maintaining selection in G418 and using a split
ratio of 1:3. After 10 passages, the cells entered crisis.
Immortalized fibroblasts that escaped crisis were transduced with a retrovirus expressing self-excising cre recombinase to generate the GSK3β(-/-); GSK3α(flox/-) (3/4KO)
fibroblast lines used in this study [33].
Cell culture and serum shock procedures
MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
(GIBCO) and a mixture of penicillin-streptomycinglutamine (PSG from GIBCO). Puromycin-resistant MEF
lines were grown, maintained, serum shocked, and serum
starved in medium containing 2 µg/mL puromycin.
Where indicated, serum shock and serum starvation
media were supplemented with a final concentration of
20 mM lithium Chloride or 25 µM kenpaullone (Calbiochem). The serum shock was performed as described previously by Balsalobre and colleagues [34], with slight
modifications: 4 × 105 cells/10 cm Petri dish were plated
6–7 days before the experiment, and serum shocked for 2
hours at TP0, and thereafter serum starved in DMEM for
the duration of the experiment. At the indicated times, fol-

lowing two ice-cold 10 ml PBS washes, the cells were lysed
in 1 mL of RLT buffer (QIAGEN) for RNA harvests, or 1
mL of RIPA buffer for protein harvests. The lysates were
collected, flash frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath, and
stored at -70°C until extraction of whole cell RNA or SDSPAGE sample preparation.
RNA purification and cDNA synthesis
All harvested RLT lysates were homogenized using
QIAshredder™ columns (QIAGEN), and RNA was
extracted from the homogenized lysates using RNeasy®
columns (QIAGEN). RNA concentrations were measured
using standard UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. All harvested samples were diluted down to the lowest registered
concentration, and electrophoresed through a denaturing
gel to verify RNA quality. 1 µg of total RNA was reversetranscribed with Stratascript™ RT (Stratagene) at 42°C for
1 hr in a final reaction volume of 10 µl, and subsequently
diluted 5-fold to generate a poly-dT cDNA library of each
harvested sample, for use as template in PCR amplification.
PCR analysis of transcriptional profiles
For all transcriptional profiles, PCR reactions for all timepoints were prepared simultaneously, where 5 µl of cDNA
was added to 45 µl of PCR mixture [10× reaction buffer,
0.5 unit Taq DNA polymerase (Roche), 0.2 mM dNTPs,
and 50 pmol of primers]. PCR cycles were as follows:
95°C for 1 min, cycles of 45 s at 95°C, 60 s at 60°C, and
120 s at 72°C, and a final extension period of 10 min at
72°C. Amplification consisted of 25 cycles for GAPDH, 27
cycles for RevErbα and Bmal1, 30 cycles for mCry1, and 34
cycles for mPer2. The following forward and reverse primers were designed, synthesized (ACTG Corp.), and utilized
in the above reactions: GAPDH forward 5'-GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGCCG-3', GAPDH reverse 5'CTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCATGAGGTC-3';

carried out at least twice to insure proper replication of
resulting transcriptional profiles.

Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) (200
µl/well of 6-well dish) in the case of the clonal selection
analyses, or 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer [1% (v/v) NP-40,
1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 150
mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 2 mM
EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM benzamidine, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate] supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche) for serum shocked MEFs. Hypotonic
lysates were centrifuged for 1 hour at 4°C at 16,100 × g.
RIPA lysates were homogenized with 23 gauge needle
syringes, and centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 12 minutes at
4°C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The clarified extract
was collected carefully so that the pellet and any floating
cellular debris were not aspirated during pipeting. Protein
content of the lysates was determined using the Dc Protein Assay (BioRad). Samples were run through 8% SDS
polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to
PVDF membranes. The blots were blocked for 1 hour (RT)
in 5% skim milk powder/TBS and then incubated for 1
hour (RT) with the following mouse monoclonal primary
antibodies diluted in 2% skim milk powder/TBST (TBS +
0.1% Tween-20): GAPDH (1:100 000, clone 6C5,
Abcam); β-Actin (1:20 000, clone AC-15, Abcam); β-catenin (1:1000, clone 14, BD Transduction Labs); and GSK3 (1:1000, clone 4G-1E, Upstate). Blots were rinsed 3×
with the antibody diluent and were then incubated for 1
hour (RT) with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (BioRad) diluted 1:10 000 in the same
buffer. After 5 washes with TBST (no milk), blots were
incubated for 5 minutes with SuperSignal West Pico
chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). X-Omat blue scientific imaging film (Kodak) was used to detect the chemiluminescent signal.

Results
Phase relationship of core clock genes in wild-type MEFs
Investigation of the role and/or requirement of GSK3 in
the circadian clock mechanism is hampered by the fact
that GSK3β nullizygous embryos develop normally to
mid-gestation, but die around day 14 of embryonic development [31]. However, the discovery by Balsalobre and
colleagues that high concentrations of serum can synchronize the oscillation of clock genes in Rat-1 fibroblasts
established the existence of peripheral clocks [34], whose
oscillatory mechanism is similar and comparable to the
central oscillator residing in the suprachiasmatic nuclei
(SCN) of the hypothalamus [23,35].

Although the expression patterns of known core clock
genes have been previously documented, the control
phase relationships among selected clock components
were established in wild-type MEFs for comparative purposes prior to the investigation of the effects of GSK3 deficiency on the clock mechanism. Following serum shock

http://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/content/5/1/3

treatment, the oscillatory transcriptional expression profile of four clock genes – mPer2 (Period 2), mCry1 (Cryptochrome 1), Bmal1 and RevErbα, were examined by reverse
transcription (RT)-PCR. The Clk (Clock) gene was
excluded from this study as Clk mRNA and CLK protein
are constitutively expressed [36]. The resulting expression
profiles (Fig. 1A) and phase relationships of these four
genes were consistent with previously published accounts
[23,24,34,37,38].
Phase relationship of core clock genes in GSK3β-null MEFs
Having established the oscillatory phases of mPer2,
mCry1, RevErbα, and Bmal1 in wild-type MEFs, the effects
of GSK3β deficiency on circadian rhythmicity were investigated in GSK3β nullizygous MEFs [31]. For mCry1,
RevErbα, and Bmal1, peak times of transcription were
identical to those observed in their wild type counterparts.
The only noticeable alteration observed was a discrete
shift in the mPer2 peak occurring in the second cycle,
which is ~TP44 in wild type MEFs (Fig. 1A,C), and delayed
to TP48 in GSK3β-/- MEFs (Fig. 1B,C), while the first peak
occurs at TP24 in both genotypes. In a setting where the
circadian clock mechanism, within a functional range, is
relatively insulated from reduction in absolute levels of
GSK3, the absence of GSK3β could be compensated by the
actions of GSK3α, where in a 72 hr time span, a 50%
reduction in GSK3 levels may still be sufficient to fully
carry out the enzyme's functional duties. Therefore, the
targeted "knock down" of the GSK3α isoform in the βnull MEFs was undertaken in order to minimize the contribution of GSK3 in the generation of transcriptional
oscillations.
GSK3α RNAi knockdown in a GSK3β nullizygous
background lengthens the mPer2 transcriptional period
A total of 13 puromycin-resistant clones were isolated
(A1.3 – A1.15), expanded, and tested by western blotting
to determine the level of GSK3α knockdown. Initial western blot analysis of the stable GSK3α knockdown clones
was done as soon as there were a sufficient number of cells
(Fig. 2). The levels of GSK3α were assessed, as well as the
cytosolic levels of β-catenin protein, which should
increase as total GSK3 levels decrease [39-41]. A clear
reduction in GSK3α protein levels with a concomitant
increase in β-catenin levels was detected in several of the
puromycin resistant clones, namely A1.4, 6, 7 and 13 (Fig.
2). In particular, the A1.13 clone had barely detectable
GSK3α protein as well as the expected massive increase in
cytosolic β-catenin levels. However, re-analysis of these
four clones, after only 3 additional passages, revealed that
despite retention of puromycin resistance, clone 13 had
recovered GSK3α expression at a level comparable to wild
type, while clone 7 had partially (~50% of wild-type)
recovered GSK3α expression (data not shown). The A1.4
and A1.6 clones initially identified as having a sub-maxi-

PCR. The subjective time points (TP) of peak expression are designated in white above the corresponding bands for each transcript examined.

mal, but significant level of knockdown still retained the
same degree of reduction, with A1.6 displaying a higher
level of GSK3α knockdown than A1.4. The complete
"reversion" of clone 13 suggested that there may be selection against cells with extremely low GSK3 levels and that
GSK3 may be essential for MEF viability. The A1.4 and
A1.6 clones were selected for subsequent serum-shock
analysis. In order to ensure that any potential circadian
effects observed in these clones were not an artefact of the
transfection process, the fully reverted A1.13 clone was
serum shocked and analyzed. The transcriptional profile
of mPer2, mCry1, Bmal1 and RevErbα in the A1.13 MEFs
were found to be identical to those observed in the parental GSK3β-null MEFs (data not shown).
The clock gene mRNA expression profiles were examined
in the A1.4 and A1.6 clones. Whereas the lengthening in
the period of mPer2 observed in the parental GSK3β-null

cell line was subtle in the context of this assay, a much
more distinctive and exaggerated mPer2 period lengthening phenotype emerged from the additional RNAi-mediated reduction of GSK3α. The effect on mPer2 was most
pronounced in A1.6, which (1) lacked the serum-induced
transcriptional peak at TP4, and (2) had a dramatic ~8 hr
delay in transcriptional repression, with peaks of transcription occurring at TP32 and TP52 (Fig. 3A,B). In parallel with the A1.4 and A1.6 RNA samples, protein extracts
were harvested at 0, 4, 24, 36 and 48 hours following the
serum shock, in order to monitor the relative reduction in
levels of GSK3 expression in the two clones (Fig. 4). As
expected, based on the screening process, the A1.6 clone
achieved the highest level of "knock-down", especially
prior to (TP0) and immediately following (TP4) serum
shock, time points at which A1.4 expressed slightly higher
levels of GSK3 (Fig. 4). These observations were consistent
with the initially intermediate effect on mPer2 transcrip-

tion seen with the A1.4 clone, which had an abrogated but
detectable serum-induced activation of mPer2 expression
at TP4, and a ~4 hr delay in transcriptional repression during the first cycle, with a peak at ~TP28 (Fig. 3A,B). However, by TP48, at which A1.4 and A1.6 both have
comparable levels of residual GSK3 expression, a delay of
~8 hrs is observed with both clones, with a peak occurring
at TP52 (Fig. 3A,B).
Lithium lengthens mPer2 period and phenocopies GSK3
knockdown
Lithium, a direct GSK3 inhibitor [16-18], is known to consistently lengthen the circadian period of a variety of
organisms in a dose-dependent manner [15,42,43]. In
fact, lithium has been shown to lengthen the period of firing rate in individual neurons of the SCN [15], suggesting
an effect on the pacemaking properties of single cells, in
addition to overt effects at the behavioural level. The
mechanistic nature of this effect, however, at the level of
the molecular circadian machinery, still remains to be elucidated. Having demonstrated a period lengthening effect
in GSK3 knockdown MEFs, specifically with respect to

mPer2 transcriptional oscillation, the molecular effect of
lithium on period length was investigated in wild type
MEFs. A final lithium concentration of 20 mM was chosen
representing the upper range of GSK3 inhibition, based
on the in vitro dose-response curve of GSK3 to lithium, as
described with respect to Tau as well as RevErbα
[17,44,45].
As can be seen in the transcriptional profiles, lithium was
also found to produce a similar period lengthening effect.
For mPer2, peaks of transcription were delayed by 4–8 hrs
to ~TP32 and TP52 (Fig. 3A,C), but unlike A1.6, a modest
induction of mPer2 was achieved at TP4, likely representing a serum response initiated prior to the full inhibitory
effect of lithium, whose uptake is known to be maximal at
~2 hr in human fibroblasts [46].
Selective inhibition of GSK3 by kenpaullone lengthens

inhibitors of CDK1/cyclin B [47], and subsequently

Analysis of total GSK3 expression prior to and following serum-shock. To verify that effects observed at the level of
transcription in clones A1.4 and A1.6 corresponded to an expected level of GSK3 knockdown, at the indicated time points,
protein and RNA samples were simultaneously isolated from harvested wild-type, A1.4, and A1.6 cells in order to monitor levels of GSK3 expression prior to and following serum shock. RNA samples were subsequently used for reverse-transcription
PCR analysis (as seen in Fig. 3), while the protein samples were subjected to Western blot analysis. Protein samples were harvested at TP0, TP4, TP24, TP32 and TP48, and blotted for total GSK3. β-Actin levels were used as a loading control.

fore represent an alternative class of GSK3 inhibitors that
are structurally and mechanistically unrelated to lithium.
Although Alsterpaullone is a more potent inhibitor of
GSK3 than kenpaullone, it has been shown to be less specific and therefore less suitable for cell-based assays [49].
Furthermore, continuous exposure of MEFs to Alsterpaullone for a period of 72 hr proved to be toxic, as most
plated cells perished after "only" ~32 hrs (data not
shown). Also, a relatively high initial concentration of
kenpaullone was administered to account for likely degradation of the compound over a 72 hr period. As such, kenpaullone, at a final concentration of 25 µM, was
administered during and immediately following serum
shock and its effect on clock gene transcription was investigated. Analysis of the subsequent transcriptional profiles
revealed a tangible effect on mPer2 period length. The
serum-induced mPer2 transcriptional peak at TP4 was relatively muted (Fig. 3A,C), an effect seen with A1.4, A1.6,
and lithium. In the first cycle, a normal subjective peak
was observed at TP24, prior to a delayed trough at TP36,
while the second peak of transcription was delayed to
TP52 (Fig. 3A,C), again, as in both GSK3-knockdown
clones and lithium. The effect of kenpaullone on GSK3
activity has been shown to be slow and gradual in various
cell lines [50], and may account, at least in part, for the
latency observed herein.

Stable genetic ablation of GSK3α(flox/-) in a GSK3β
nullizygous background lengthens the mPer2
transcriptional period
In order to further confirm the circadian repercussions of
in vitro GSK3 knockdown, and to attribute the observed
effects on mPer2 transcriptional cycling specifically to
GSK3 expression levels, a genetically defined stable
knockout (3/4 DKO) MEF line was generated to circumvent issues of targeting and cellular response specificity
presented by the RNAi method of GSK3 knockdown.
Although numerous attempts at generating stable GSK3α/
β double knockout MEFs from GSK3α(flox/flox);GSK3β(-/-)
MEFs using cre-recombinase approaches have been
unsuccessful to date, a GSK3α(flox/-) stable MEF line, designated as c2.1, was successfully generated in a GSK3β nullizygous background. Using the earliest passage, and
therefore youngest cell lines available, the mPer2 transcriptional profile was examined in both A6 (wildtype)
MEFs, and c2.1 3/4 DKO MEFs over a 44 hr time span following serum shock (Fig. 5A,B). To monitor GSK3 expression in c2.1 relative to A6, protein extracts of both cell
lines were harvested at 0, 4, 12, 24, 30 and 36 hours following the serum shock (Fig. 5C) in parallel with the
serum shocked A6 and c2.1 RNA samples. Also, between
TPs 20 and 32, RNA samples were harvested at 2 hr intervals, rather than 4 hr intervals, to better examine the tran-

scriptional fluctuation of mPer2 in this critical time
interval.
As previously described, mPer2 transcription in wildtype
MEFs peaked at TP24, following the initial transcriptional
response to serum shock at TP1 (Fig. 5A,D). By contrast,
despite a similar peak in transcription at TP1, mPer2 transcriptional expression was blunted in amplitude and
maintained near maximal levels between TP24 and TP28
and transcriptional repression in c2.1 was delayed until
after TP28 (Fig. 5B,D), an effect consistent with previous

http://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/content/5/1/3

results obtained by reducing GSK3 activity by shRNA,
genetically or pharmacologically. To ensure reproducibility, A6 samples and transcriptional profiles were harvested
and generated in triplicate, while the c2.1 samples were
harvested and generated in sextuplicate (Fig. 5E).
The ~4 hr lengthening in mPer2 transcription in the c2.1
cell line, which is 75% deficient in GSK3 expression most
resembles the ~4 hr mPer2 transcriptional lengthening
observed with the previously characterized A1.4 line
which exhibited a similar level of GSK3α expression.

mPer2 and GAPDH were analyzed by reverse-transcription PCR in the A6(wt) and c2.1(3/4 DKO) cell lines, as depicted in panels A and B, respectively. Protein samples harvested from whole-cell lysates in parallel to RNA samples harvested for transcriptional analysis at corresponding time points were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.

Discussion
Our results have demonstrated that both genetic and
pharmacological reduction of GSK3 activity have a specific effect on the circadian transcriptional oscillation consisting of mPer2 period lengthening following serum
shock-mediated in vitro synchronization, indicating a
delay in phase. This is a particularly salient feature with
respect to lithium's mood stabilizing properties, considering the correspondence between mPer2 expression and
behavioural rhythms [51], suggesting that mPer2 may be
more intimately involved in driven behaviour than other
clock genes. The question now becomes: how does a
decrease in GSK3 activity result in phase delay, specifically
with respect to Per2, taking into consideration the current
paradigm of the circadian clock mechanism? As the primary transcriptional inhibitors, period length is controlled by the mCRY proteins, through their regulated and
mPER-heterodimerization-dependent timing of nuclear
translocation [24,26,52]. This post-translational modification-imposed delay in nuclear translocation is optimized to maintain a period of ~24 hr [21,53].
Mathematical modeling of the mammalian circadian
oscillator feedback loops has shown that extreme delays
(~7 hr) can be achieved by varying the nuclear import rate
of the PER/CRY complex, and delays >8.8 hr between Per/
Cry mRNA and nuclear PER/CRY protein accumulation
result in the abolishment of oscillation [54]. The predictions of this model were consistent with subsequent findings in cultured unsynchronized primary fibroblasts
derived from mPer2Luciferase-SV40 knockin mice, whose
rhythmic periods were found to range from ~22 to ~30 hrs
[55]. Furthermore, mPer2 expression was found to be
phase delayed by 8 hr in Clock mutant mice compared to
wild-type siblings [56]. Therefore, the maximal delay of
~8 hrs in mPer2 achieved in this present study further
establishes this upper limit in period length allowed,
beyond which catastrophic failure in rhythmicity may
result. This level of periodic plasticity is likely allowed, at
least in part, by the hallmark difference of ~8 hr between
the transcriptional peaks of mPer1/2 and mCry1 [24], and
the rate limiting role of mPER proteins for PER-CRY interaction and nuclear accumulation [52]. As such, assuming
a PER/CRY complex nuclear translocation-promoting role
of GSK3 similar to that of SGG and the PER/TIM complex
in the Drosophila clock mechanism [19], it can be postulated that a reduction in the levels of GSK3 may produce
a delay in the nuclear translocation of the PER/CRY complex. Most recently, Iitaka and colleagues [57] found that
GSK3β (i) interacts with PER2 in vitro and in vivo, (ii) can
phosphorylate PER2 in vitro, (iii) promotes the nuclear
translocation of PER2 in COS1 cells and (iv) overexpression caused an ~2 hr advance in mPer2 phase. Extreme
phenotypes are defined by mutations that alter period by
>15% (3–4 hr) or lead to complete loss of circadian
rhythms. In cases in which null mutants are lethal, an

http://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/content/5/1/3

extreme phenotype can be deemed sufficiently compelling to define a clock gene of interest. The mClk, Dbt, Tau,
and herein described GSK3 mutants fall into this category
in which mutations caused >4 hr period changes and true
null mutations are not available [58].
Lithium, a well documented direct inhibitor of GSK3, has
been a cornerstone of BPD therapeutics despite a dearth of
knowledge concerning the nature of its efficacy and its
mode of action. Its ability to modulate circadian rhythmicity however, specifically its phase delaying properties
in numerous, phylogenetically diverse organisms, has
been a major factor in establishing a causal and symptomalogical link between BPD and circadian rhythms. In
behavioural studies where concentrations of lithium comparable to those used in humans for the treatment of BPD
(0.6–1.2 mM) are administered, the period altering effects
are often measured over the span of weeks or months, and
produce subtle but significant effects usually measured in
minutes rather than hours [2]. Conversely, cell culture
based assays with much more limited temporal windows
of observation, such as the present study, have consistently demonstrated the need for higher concentrations of
lithium [15,43,44,57,59]. In fact, clinical amelioration of
mood in BPD patients often takes weeks to appear following chronic lithium administration [60], a time span consistent with a gradual realignment of the circadian clock.
Furthermore, a number of studies have examined SNP
mutations in the effective GSK3β promoter. Kwok and
colleagues [61] showed that a T/C substitution in said
promoter is associated with the level of transcriptional
activity, with C substitution resulting in decreased expression, while three studies by Benedetti et al. have shown C/
C homozygote BPD patients shared clinical features suggestive of a milder form of the illness, including a later age
of onset, improved antidepressant response, and better
long-term response to lithium mood stabilization [6164]. The present results also offer a possible explanation
to a report in which 2 circular manic-depressive subjects
whose circadian clocks were deemed "too slow" were lithium non-responders, whereas 5 subjects in the same study
with a "fast" circadian rhythm free run were responsive
[65].
Atack [66] appropriately proposed that any hypothesis on
the therapeutic actions of lithium should be able to
explain how it controls both mania and depression by
modulating the activity of distinct neurotransmitter systems that control these extremes of mood. Direct signaling targets of GSK3 are unlikely to fully satisfy this
requirement. However, the modulatory role of GSK3 in
the circadian clock mechanism, whose output signals regulate various neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems,
provides the basis for lithium-mediated control of a broad
array of neuronal signaling pathways in which abnormal-

ities have been demonstrated in BPD. Moreover, neuroactive drugs do not commonly alter circadian timing [67]. It
is therefore highly significant that three other structurally
unrelated antidepressants – the second generation
monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) clorgyline, the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine, have been
attributed chronobiotic properties in studies of their
chronic administration in rodents [6,68].
Considering the subset of BPD patients who are nonresponsive to lithium, and the fact that circadian abnormalities do not necessarily result in mood disorders [6],
and vice versa, the inhibition of GSK3 by lithium in the
context of circadian rhythms is hardly a panacea for the
therapy of affective mood disorders. Nevertheless, (i) the
cyclical and episodic nature of BPD symptoms, (ii) the
prevalence of circadian rhythm abnormalities in BPD,
(iii) the consistent evolutionarily conserved period/phase
altering effects of lithium, (iv) the direct inhibition of
GSK3 by lithium in vivo and in vitro, and (v) the role of
Sgg/GSK3 in the modulation of period length in fruit fly
and murine clocks, places GSK3 at the forefront of the
short list of known physiological targets in the therapeutic
efficacy of lithium in BPD.
