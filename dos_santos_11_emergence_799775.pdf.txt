Emergence and evolution of the glycoprotein
hormone and neurotrophin gene families in
vertebrates

Abstract
Background: The three vertebrate pituitary glycoprotein hormones (GPH) are heterodimers of a common a and a
specific b subunit. In human, they are located on different chromosomes but in a similar genomic environment.
We took advantage of the availability of genomic and EST data from two cartilaginous fish species as well as from
two lamprey species to identify their repertoire of neurotrophin, lin7 and KCNA gene family members which are in
the close environment of gphb. Gpha and gphb are absent outside vertebrates but are related to two genes
present in both protostomes and deuterostomes that were named gpa2 and gpb5. Genomic organization and
functional characteristics of their protein products suggested that gpha and gphb might have been generated
concomitantly by a duplication of gpa2 and gpb5 just prior to the radiation of vertebrates. To have a better insight
into this process we used new genomic resources and tools to characterize the ancestral environment before the
duplication occurred.
Results: An almost similar repertoire of genes was characterized in cartilaginous fishes as in tetrapods. Data in
lampreys are either incomplete or the result of specific duplications and/or deletions but a scenario for the
evolution of this genomic environment in vertebrates could be proposed. A number of genes were identified in
the amphioxus genome that helped in reconstructing the ancestral environment of gpa2 and gpb5 and in
describing the evolution of this environment in vertebrates.
Conclusion: Our model suggests that vertebrate gpha and gphb were generated by a specific local duplication of
the ancestral forms of gpa2 and gpb5, followed by a translocation of gphb to a new environment whereas gpha
was retained in the gpa2-gpb5 locus. The two rounds of whole genome duplication that occurred early in the
evolution of vertebrates generated four paralogues of each gene but secondary gene losses or lineage specific
duplications together with genomic rearrangements have resulted in the present organization of these genes,
which differs between vertebrate lineages.

Background
The pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH)
and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), together with
the pituitary thyrotropin (TSH) are the core members of
the glycoprotein hormone (GPH) family. These hormones are heterodimers composed of a common a
(GPHa) and a b subunit that confers biological specificity. Characterizations of the GPH family in a wide
range of osteichthyes have clearly shown that the

common a subunit and the three GPHb subunit
lineages were already present before the split between
actinopterygians (the branch leading to teleosts) and sarcopterygians (including tetrapods) [1]. An unambiguous
GPHa as well as two GPHb subunits were also isolated
from a chondrichthyan, the small spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula [2]. The latter appeared related in
sequence to LHb and FSHb, the presence of a third,
TSHb-related form, remaining an unanswered issue.
Finally, analyses of GPH in cyclostomes (extant jawless
vertebrates or agnatha) have provided evidence for a
unique gonadotropin (GtH), with the isolation of a single GPHb-related cDNA in the lamprey Petromyzon

marinus [3] and of one a and a single GPHb-related
cDNA in the hagfish Paramyxine atami [4].
To gain insight into their evolutionary process, the
genomic environment of these genes needs to be further
explored. Among the genes in synteny with the gph, the
neurotrophin (NT) genes have already been submitted
to an evolutionary investigation. NT are homodimeric
growth factors that play important functions in neuronal
development and survival [5]. There are four NT types
in tetrapods: nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NTF3)
and neurotrophin 4 (NTF4) (also named NTF5 or
NTF6). The same set of NT is present in teleosts with
an additional, NGF-related NT (NTF7) [6]. Two out of
the four NT were evidenced from chondrichthyes, one
characterized as BDNF, the other one being closer to
NTF3 [7] and a single NT (NT1) has been isolated to
date from the lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis [8]. Interestingly, three NT genes appeared located in the human
genome in the direct vicinity of the three GPHb subunit
genes which prompted the authors to propose that
GPHb and NT genes may derive from successive duplications from a genomic segment bearing the ancestral
NT and GPHb subunit genes [8,9]. It was tempting to
assume that these duplications have taken place during
the two rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD)
that occurred between the divergence of urochordates
(the sister group of vertebrates) and the radiation of
gnathostomes (see [10] and references herein).
In order to test this hypothesis, we used BLAST analysis to exhaustively search the elephant shark Callorhinchus milii [11] and the sea lamprey Petromyzon
marinus genomic sequences for the presence of genes
that are in the close genomic environment of gphb and
nt. These genomic data where enriched with data from
an EST analysis from another cartilaginous fish, Scyliorhinus canicula and from another cyclostome, Lampetra
fluviatilis. When necessary, PCR amplifications from
genomic DNA were used to complete the data.
Unlike NT, which are present in both deuterostome
and protostome representatives [12], canonical GPHa,
LHb, FSHb and TSHb cannot be identified outside vertebrates [13]. However, human genome survey unexpectedly pointed to the presence of two proteins sharing
common structural characteristics with GPHa and b
subunits, which were consequently termed glycoprotein
a-2 (GPA2) and glycoprotein b-5 (GPB5) [14]. In addition to their structural likeness, the recombinant proteins were shown to form a heterodimer that was able
to bind and activate a GPH receptor (GPHR), namely
the TSHR, both in vitro [15-17] and in vivo [16], giving
an additional argument in support to a parental relationship between GPA2 and GPB5 and the GPHa and b
subunits. Further genome explorations revealed the

presence of gpa2 and gpb5-related genes (hereafter
named gpa and gpb, respectively, when dealing with protostomes and pre-vertebrate deuterostomes) in most
bilaterian groups [15,18-22]. Remarkably, the recombinant GPA and GPB proteins from the fruit fly were also
shown to form a heterodimer able to activate the fruit
fly receptor homologous to the vertebrate GPHR [18].
Interestingly, in Nasonia vitripennis at least, a hymenoptera in which gpa and gpb are not found in the genome
[22,23], the GPHR-related receptor gene is also missing
[23]. The same observation was made in the leech
Helobdella robusta [24], which suggests that the presence of the receptor is strongly linked to the presence
of this heterodimeric potential ligand.
The GPHb subunits have no known role either as
monomer or homodimer except for the b subunit of the
human chorionic gonadotropin, which is believed to
interfere with the TGFb apoptotic action in certain cancer cell lines [25]. All vertebrate GPHb subunits share
the a subunit as an exclusive dimerisation partner. It is
then highly probable that the ancestral b subunit also
had the a subunit as a partner. The GPHa and ancestral
GPHb must have then been generated concomitantly.
When present, gpa and gpb are localized next to each
other in most invertebrate genomes including the urochordate Ciona. It is also the case in teleosts where
gpa2 and one of the two paralogous gpb5 forms have
kept this organization [22]. Taken together, these data
strongly suggest that gpha together with the ancestral
gphb, as well as gpa2 and gpb5 originated from the
duplication of a locus containing the closely located gpa
and gpb and that this event took place sometime after
the emergence of urochordates.
In order to fill the gap between the gph subunit genes
and their molecular ancestors, we took advantage of the
growing availability of genomic data in chordates to
extensively characterize the gpa-gpb environment in
amphioxus as well as the vertebrate environments of
gpha and gphb subunits and of gpa2 and gpb5. By comparing the syntenic relationships of these environments,
we were able to reconstitute the ancestral chordate and
vertebrate gpa/gpb-related gene environment and to
propose a model of evolution of these genes during vertebrate radiation, involving gene duplications, transpositions and secondary losses.

cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, USA) according to
manufacturer’s protocol.
The list of oligonucleotide primers used for this study
is available on request: they usually are 20-23 nucleotides long with a melting temperature (Tm) ranging
from 60 to 68°C. Reactions were realized in a volume of
25 μl containing 10 ng of genomic DNA (or of a 1/
1000th dilution of a primary PCR reaction or of a purified fragment), 0.5 units of GoTaq DNA polymerase
(Eurogentec, Saraing, Belgium) with its appropriate 1×
buffer supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum
albumin (when capillary tubes were used), 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP and 0.2 μM of each primer. PCR
reactions were either run on a 1605 Rapid Cycler (Idaho
Technology, Idaho falls, ID) with a denaturation step of
1 min at 94°C followed by 35-40 cycles of 10 sec at 94°
C, 10 sec at 5°C under the Tm of the oligonucleotide
with the lowest Tm and 30 sec - 1 min at 72°C or on a
BioRad C1000 thermal cycler using the same parameters
except that 30 sec steps were used rather than 10 sec’s.
A 3’ tailing was achieved by a 30 min additional incubation step at 72°C when subcloning of amplified fragments were to be performed. Amplified fragments were
eluted from 1× TAE (40 mM Tris, 2 mM acetic acid, 1
mM EDTA) buffered agarose gel using MinElute Qiagen
extraction kit (Qiagen AS, Oslo, Norway). They were
then either used as template for nested PCR or subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega Corporation,
Madison, WI) or pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Ca) and sequenced (value read
sequencing at MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany).
All sequences of C. milii have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers HQ174782 to HQ174794).
The EST sequences were obtained through high
throughput sequencing of several tissue or stage specific
cDNA libraries: a Lampetra fluviatilis embryonic-prolarval (stages 20-26) cDNA library (EMBL:FR693754], a
Petromyzon marinus larval head cDNA library [26]
(EMBL:FR693760; BN001520-BN001524) and a Scyliorhinus canicula embryonic cDNA library [27] (EMBL::
FR693755-FR693759).
Database searches

Most sequences were obtained by BLAST analyses [28]
on public databases on the NCBI website (http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov./Blast.cgi) using nucleotide or protein
sequences as query depending on the phylogenetic distance between the query and the target database. The
elephant shark Callorhinchus milii and lamprey Petromyzon marinus sequences were first BLAST searched
on Trace archives of the whole genome shotgun (WGS)
sequence databases for these species on NCBI or on the
Contig reconstructions available at the dedicated server
(http://esharkgenome.imcb.a-star.edu.sg/)
for

Callorhinchus genome or at the Genome Sequencing
Center website of the Washington University in Saint
Louis for Petromyzon genome (http://genome.wustl.edu/
tools/blast/Petromyzon_marinus-3.0).
Genomic clustering and synteny analysis

Genomic environments were analyzed using the NCBI
Map viewer website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/) for human (v36), zebrafish (Danio rerio: Zv9),
chicken (Gallus gallus: built 2.1) and lizard (Anolis carolinensis: built 1.1) genomes, Ensembl website (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) for lamprey (Petromyzon marinus: assembly WUSTL v3.0) genome and
the JGI websites (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/) for
amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae assembly v1.0) and
the sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis assembly v2.0)
genomes.
The paralogous gene sets were determined and refined
by comparisons between the amphioxus and vertebrate
genomes in a procedure including several successive
steps. We first used the Genomicus [29] online genomic
analysis tool (http://www.dyogen.ens.fr/genomicus57.01/cgi-bin/search.pl) to trace back amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae assembly version 2) homologues of
genes found in the direct vicinity of gpa2, gpb5 and
GPH subunit genes in human, chicken or zebrafish genomes. Analysis of their location showed that a large
number of them were concentrated on a limited number
of scaffolds of variable length in amphioxus. In a reverse
approach and still using Genomicus, the second step
consisted in determining the location in human genome
of the homologues of all amphioxus genes carried by
those of the scaffolds containing the higher concentration of homologues. The individual members of the corresponding human gene families appeared to be
distributed among definite areas with synteny relationship with the amphioxus scaffolds. New areas were
therefore identified that contained paralogues of genes
located in the genomic environment of gph or gpa/gpb
related genes. In a third step, we then systematically
determined the location in the human genome of the
paralogues of the genes present in each of these areas.
Paralogous relationships at the vertebrate level were
obtained a priori on the Ensembl server (http://www.
ensembl.org/index.html). When the level of paralogy
was not clearly determined, BLAST analyses were performed using human sequences against the amphioxus
genome. If some related human sequences matched a
single amphioxus gene, the target amphioxus gene was
reverse-blasted against the human genome to verify that
the initial human query genes were indeed the true
homologues (ie they obtained the higher blast hit
values). At the end of this third step, we were then able
to better determine the size and gene composition of a

Santos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:332
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/332

number of paralogous regions in the human genome. In
a fourth step and in order to ensure their grouping into
four paralogous gene sets (ie, tetra-paralogons) the location of orthologues of representative (with regard to
their position) genes identified in these paralogous
regions were determined in chicken and lizard genomes
on the Ensembl server. In a final step, we identified all
the amphioxus homologues to the human genes that
constituted the tetra-paralogons. This was done by using
the search procedure on the JGI website (http://genome.
jgi-psf.org/cgi-bin/searchGM?db=Brafl1) of Branchiostoma floridae genomic version 1 then by checking that
the best hit in human of the obtained gene model
indeed corresponded to the gene with which the homologous relationship was looked for. The scaffold position
was then obtained by blasting the gene model of version
1 on the amphioxus genome version 2 which was the
version used for genome comparisons.
Phylogenetic reconstructions

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on protein
sequences aligned using Se-AL software (http://tree.bio.
ed.ac.uk/software/seal) either by using a maximum likelihood method with PhyML 3.0 software [30] with
WAG as substitution model and the default settings on
the web server phylogny.fr (http://www.phylogeny.fr/version2_cgi/phylogeny.cgi) or by a maximum parsimony
method with PAUP version 4.1beta (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony [31]). The robustness of the reconstructions was estimated by bootstrapping using (100
replicates for PhyML, 1000 for PAUP).

Results and Discussion
Conserved gene organization of GPHb subunit gene loci
in teleosts and tetrapods

As initially shown by Hallböök and his collaborators [8,9],
the three human GPHb subunit genes lie on different
chromosomes but share a synteny to NT genes, lhb, fshb
and tshb being located in the close proximity of ntf4, bdnf
and ngf on human chromosome (chr.) 19, 11 and 1,
respectively (Figure 1). A fourth NT gene (ntf3) is also present on human chr. 12 but no trace of another gphb has
been found in its surroundings. In order to assess the conservation of this synteny relationship in gnathostomes, we
first analyzed the gphb gene environment in zebrafish,
chicken and human genomes (Figure 1). The association
between gphb and nt genes observed in human was found
to be conserved in all three species, except for the lhb subunit. In zebrafish, this subunit is located on chromosome
13 while ntf4 lies on chromosome 3. In chicken, although
LHb subunit cDNA was characterized years ago [32] and
also cloned in more recent studies (GenBank:HQ872606),
the corresponding gene remained undetectable by BLAST
analysis in the current chicken genomic database. A

further search of two other bird genome sequences (zebra
finch Taeniopygia guttata and turkey Meleagris gallopavo)
led us to the same disappointing result although LHb
cDNA (GenBank:L35519.1) has also been cloned from turkey. This will be further discussed below. The zebrafish
ngf/tshb environment on chr. 6 was found to be duplicated
on chr. 23, which contains a teleost-specific ngf paralogue
termed ntf7 [6], in the vicinity of a tshb-related gene
(tshbrp: GenBank:XM_001341527.1). The sequence of the
latter was poorly conserved but still presents characteristics of a cystine-knot protein and contains a potential glycosylation site in a conserved position with other TSHb
subunits (Additional file 1: GPHb subunit sequences) suggesting that it must be able to form a heterodimer with an
a subunit and play a physiological role. Three additional
potential glycosylation sites are even present, one in the
same position as in FSHb or LHb, a second one, just after
the 10th cysteine residue and a third one, less likely, just
in-between cysteine residues 8 and 9. This duplication is
related to the large-scale genomic duplication (Fish Specific Genomic Duplication or FSGD) known to have
occurred early during the evolution of teleosts [33,34].
Searches for additional conserved synteny with the
gphb/nt environments (named after their gphb type put
in brackets, the ntf3 region devoid of any gphb being
named [GPHb-Ghost]) showed that they also include
the members of the Kv1 family of shaker-related voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNA) and all lin7
gene family members (Figure 1). These gene families
were particularly important for our studies on the evolution of the gphb subunit environment because kcna4
and kcna7 are next to fshb on human chr. 11 and to
ntf4 on chr. 19, respectively and because lin7c and lin7b
are next to bdnf on chr. 11 and to tshb on chr. 1,
respectively, suggesting that the ancestors of all four
gene families must have been neighbors in a tight locus
in an ancestral genome. As expected, lin7a is conserved
in [GPHb-Ghost], lin7b in [LHb] and lin7c in [FSHb]
(Figure 1). One single kcna gene is found conserved in
[FSHb] and [LHb], whereas 3 sets of genes are clustered
in [TSHb] and [GPHb-Ghost]. From the duplicated
[GPHb-Ghost] in zebrafish, only 2 kcna genes were
maintained. As previously shown [35] the duplicated
kcna5 gene was lost, so were the duplicated nt and lin7
genes. As for lhb, no lin7b, ntf4, kcna7 sequences could
be identified in the chicken genome (while a Lin7b
cDNA is known to exist: [GenBank:CN234764.1]). Such
discrepancies between cDNA and genomic data have
been reported for a high number of chicken or turkey
genes, whose orthologues are located on human chr.
19q [36-38]. However, a locus including lin7b [Ensembl:
ENSACAG00000013247], kcna7 [Ensembl:ENSACAT00000013329]
and
lhb
[Ensembl:ENSACAG00000013327] is found in the lizard Anolis

Figure 1 Comparative genomic environment of gphb subunit genes in representative vertebrates. Human (Hs), chicken (Gg) and
zebrafish (Dr) gphb (lhb, fshb and tshb) environment ([GPHb]) are shown with their coordinates in megabase pairs from the p end of the
relevant chromosome (chr.). [LHb] is not found in chicken genomic databases but the existence of at least lhb and lin7b is known from their
cDNA product. A fish-specific genomic duplication (FSGD) generated specific duplicates in zebrafish. A paralogous environment devoid of any
gphb subunit gene is named [GPHb-Ghost].

carolinensis (chr. 6 at 80 Mb on AnoCar2.0 at Ensembl,
see below), indicating that they were also grouped in the
last common ancestor of diapsides.
Taken together, these data convincingly confirm the
hypothesis [8] that expansion of the NT and GPHb subunit genes derived from duplications of an ancestral
locus that also contained a Lin7 gene and at least one
KCNA gene. These duplications must have taken place
before the split between tetrapod and teleost ancestors.
Characterization of the GPHb, NT, Lin7, KCNA gene
repertoire in chondrichthyes

In order to better assess the timing of the duplication
events giving rise to the gphb-nt-lin7-kcna regions, we

conducted a systematic search for these genes in two
chondrichthyes, the elephant shark C. milii and the dogfish S. canicula.
GPHb. BLAST analysis of elephant shark genome survey sequence allowed us to identify the first and second
coding exons of fshb on separate genomic fragments
and the first exon of tshb (Additional file 1). No BLAST
hit was obtained for lhb possibly due to the low, 1.4 ×
coverage of the elephant shark genome since cDNA
encoding LHb and FSHb subunits were cloned from
another cartilaginous fish species, Scyliorhinus canicula
[2]. However, genomic PCR using primers for the two
elephant shark fsh exons confirmed that the two exon
sequences corresponded to the same gene. The

Santos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:332
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/332

sequence of the first exon of tshb was used to re-BLAST
a Callorhinchus pituitary cDNA library and two different
TSHb cDNA were identified, one of which matched the
first exon sequence (Additional file 1). These results,
together with those previously reported [2], definitively
demonstrated the presence of the three gphb subunit
gene lineages, lhb, fshb and tshb, in chondrichthyes. The
existence of two tshb subunit genes in Callorhinchus is
discussed below.
NT genes. Three complete NT coding sequences and
two additional 5’ and 3’ non-overlapping fragments were
identified by an initial BLAST search on elephant shark
genomic data. The first three sequences were confidently identified as NTF4, BDNF and NGF by sequence
similarity (Additional file 2: Neurotrophin sequences).
Indeed, the N-terminal ends of NT proteins are quite
specific and difficult to align between the different types
whereas the cystine-knot coding regions are very conserved, hence not very helpful for reliable phylogenetic
analyses. The 5’ fragment was clearly part of the NTF3
as confirmed by its identity with the full-length
sequence of the dogfish NTF3 cDNA obtained by
BLAST search on the Scyliorhinus cDNA library. PCR
was used to extend the 5’ NTF3 fragment toward the 3’
end and the newly generated sequence complemented
the end of another genomic segment of the database,
thus completing the coding region of elephant shark
NTF3. Similarly, PCR experiment using degenerate oligonucleotides allowed us to extend the other, 3’ fragment, toward the 5’ end and to obtain a sequence that
was used to BLAST search the genomic data library
where an overlapping 5’ fragment was found. The
reconstituted full length fifth NT encoding sequence
was checked by PCR cloning on shark genomic DNA.
This fifth NT presented 61.5% identity with NTF4 at the
nucleotide level but part of its N-terminal amino acid
sequence was totally different. When aligned with
NTF4, a deletion of two nucleotides was evidenced in
the N-terminal part of the sequence, inducing a frame
shift that was corrected by a single additional nucleotide
deletion 78 nucleotides downstream, resuming the original reading frame (Additional file 3: Elephant shark
NTF4 and NTF4rp). This sequence was thus named
NTF4rp. NTF4 but not NTF4rp was identified in addition to NTF3 from the Scyliorhinus cDNA library (Additional file 2). NTF4, NTF4rp and NGF are described
here for the first time in chondrichthyes.
LIN7 and KCNA. BLAST searches for lin7-related
genes in S. canicula databases led to the identification
of three different ESTs corresponding to lin7a, lin7b
and lin7c and provided no evidence for an additional
member of the lin7 family (Figure 2, Additional file 4:
Lin7 sequences). Similarly, four different genomic fragments were found in C. milii draft genome sequence;

the longest fragment encoded 4 of the 5 exons of what
was clearly lin7c, two other genomic fragments included
two additional 4th exons, the last one representing an
additional exon 3 (Additional file 4). This sampling was
compatible with the existence of three lin7-related
sequences. Finally, eight members of the kcna family
were identified in the elephant shark genomic database.
Six of them were almost complete (Additional file 5:
Elephant shark KCNA sequences). Sequence alignment
and phylogenetic analysis showed that each of them
could confidently be linked to one member of the family
(Figure 3).
Identification of GPHb, NT, Lin7 and KCNA genes in
cyclostomes

Petromyzon marinus genomic DNA analysis revealed the
presence of a single gphb subunit gene. Like Sower and
colleagues [39], we were unable to find a second gphb
sequence, either by BLAST search on genomic or EST
data or by PCR on genomic DNA using primers designed
from the most conserved regions. The GPHb subunit
was proposed to be related to FSHb or LHb and named
GtHb (for gonadotropin), based on sequence comparison
and its ability to have its expression stimulated by GnRH
[3]. Two GPH-type receptors were characterized in lamprey, GPHRI that binds GtH [40] and GPHRII, which
appeared closer to a thyrotropin receptor [41]. It is then
likely that a second, TSH-type ligand, also exists in lampreys. Three NT genes were characterized, referred to as
NT1, NT2 and NTz (Additional file 2). NT1 had already
been characterized from Lampetra fluviatilis [8]. Nt2,
which we also characterized from Lampetra fluviatilis
larval EST screened by BLAST, was on the same Contig1180 (42775nt long) as gthb, suggesting that it may be
related to NTF4 and/or bdnf. NT1 and NTz were quite
dissimilar from each other and from the other NTs so
that their assignment to either members of gnathostome
NT family could not be determined. Two lin7 genes were
found (Additional file 4) that could not be confidently
assigned to any of the three Lin7a-b-c forms of gnathostomes by phylogenetic reconstruction (Figure. 2) and
were thus named lin7_1 (EMBL:BN001523; genomic
contig5027) and lin7_2 (EMBL:BN0015234; genomic
contig34734 and several ESTs). Finally, a total of at least
12 members of KCNA-related sequences were also found
(Additional file 6: Lamprey KCNA sequences). Their
relationships with other vertebrate KCNA sequences
could not be confidently determined.
Evolution of the GPHb subunit gene environment in
vertebrates

Taken together, these data show that the duplication
events leading to the presence of four sets of NT, three
sets of GPHb subunits and Lin7 genes, as well as of the

Figure 2 Phylogeny of Lin7b sequences. Phylogenetic reconstruction of chicken (Gallus), human (Homo), zebrafish (Danio) dogfish

eight KCNA forms, has taken place prior to the gnathostome radiation. This chronology of duplications as well as
the conserved synteny observed for these genes in
osteichthyes (actinopterygians plus sarcopterygians) is
consistent with the hypothesis that the corresponding
duplication events may have been part of the two rounds
of WGD known to have taken place prior to the split
between chondrichthyes and osteichthyes (Figure 4). As
already proposed [35], local duplications of one of the
kcna genes issued from the first round of WGD gave rise
to three copies of the gene in one of the sister loci. It is
still a matter of debate whether the second round of WGD
occurred before or after the emergence of cyclostomes
[42,43]. Depending on its timing, the cyclostomes would
either have two or four sets of genes. However, our search
led to the identification of one gphb (but a tshb is suspected to exist), two lin7, three nt and twelve or more
kcna genes, which is inconsistent with either alternative
and seems to indicate that some genomic data are missing
(if the two WGD have already occurred) or that some of
the genes were submitted to specific duplications in the

lineage leading to Petromyzon. A higher quality genome
coverage and assembly will be required to gain insight into
the details of these genetic events. We also provide evidence for the occurrence of additional duplication events,
giving rise to two NTF4 and two tshb-related sequences in
the elephant shark. Whether the latter two involved duplication of large chromosomal fragments remains an opened
question in the absence of synteny arguments in chondrichthyes. In particular, an interesting possibility is that
the second tshb gene (tshb2) may be part of the ntf3lin7a-kcna1-6-5-containing region, as the fourth gphb
paralogue, possibly lost from the genome of osteichthyes
(Figure 4). In other respects, of all the genomic environments generated by the fish-specific genome duplication it
is noteworthy that only the one paraloguous to [TSHb]
remained unaltered in the zebrafish and still contains a
tshbrp subunit, ntf7 and the three sets of kcna.
Origin of the vertebrate GPHb subunit gene environment

If gph, nt, lin7 and kcna ancestors were neighbors in a
tight locus in an ancestral genome (see above),

Figure 3 Phylogeny of KCNA sequences. Left panel: Xenopus, chicken (Gallus), zebrafish (Danio), elephant shark (Callorhinchus) and human
(Homo) KCNA sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions were inferred using the maximum parsimony method (heuristic search). Bootstrapping
(values at the nodes) was used over 1000 replicates. The KCNA type is indicated by the number following the species name. The neurotrophintype to which they are neighbor in human genomes is indicated in bold with the human sequence reference. All but KCNA6 were included into
monophyletic groups (highlighted by alternate colors) that were supported by bootstrap values of 50% and over (values in bold). Right panel:
amphioxus sequences are substituted to Xenopus sequences. None of the amphioxus sequence is closer to either vertebrate KCNA type. Lower
bootstrap values were obtained when amphioxus sequences were included because only truncated sequences could reliably be aligned.

numerous genomic rearrangements have occurred during the vertebrate radiation [44] and some descendant
genes appear scattered in vertebrates (see on Figure 1
the position of lin7a relative to ntf3 or kcna genes on
human chr. 12 and chicken chr. 1). In order to better
characterize the ancestral composition of the GPHb
genomic environment, we needed to look at the genome
of a species closer to the origin of vertebrates. The
amphioxus genome was chosen over the highly rearranged genome of Ciona. We searched the amphioxus
homologues of the genes found close to [LHb], [FSHb],
[TSHb] and [GPHb-Ghost] in human, chicken and zebrafish genomes. Few amphioxus scaffolds contained
homologues of genes from all four [GPHb] environments. We then determined the location of the human
homologues of all amphioxus genes carried by these
scaffolds. Human homologous family members were

distributed among definite genomic areas. The composition and boundaries of these areas were refined by
determining the location of the paralogues of all their
members, which were most often found within one or
the other of these areas. At this stage, we had a number
of scattered genomic areas, some of which including the
previously characterized genomic environment of one or
the other GPHb gene, but their clustering into four
paralogous sets of genes (ie tetra-paralogon) was not
obvious. We therefore determined the position of zebrafish, chicken, and lizard orthologues of a number of
human genes picked-up all along each of the regions.
The zebrafish genome with the additional FSGD and
numerous rearrangements turned out to be unsuitable
for this task. However, some of the scattered regions in
human were linked into a continuous segment in
chicken and lizard genomes, allowing characterization of

whole genome duplication (WGD). Right panel: resulting known genomic loci in sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, elephant shark Callorhinchus
milii and zebrafish Danio rerio. It is still to be established whether cyclostomes have been submitted to the two rounds of genome duplication
or not. Duplicate loci resulting from WGD or the Fish Specific Genome Duplication (FSGD) are indicated by vertical brackets whereas horizontal
brackets represent local gene duplications (LD). Crossed boxes represent genes that have been lost after duplication. Genes demonstrated to be
gathered in a definite locus are linked by a horizontal bar. The origin of tshb2 in Callorhinchus is uncertain, either resulting from the second
round of WGD or from a local duplication of tshb. A tshb-type subunit gene is expected in lamprey but has not been characterized yet and is
represented as an empty box. NTFt and NTFg are given symbols for ancestral NTs associated with TSH and GTH, respectively.

each of the four paralogous sets of genes (Figure 5,
Table 1 and Additional file 7). For example, the paralogous gene set including [GPHb-Ghost] appeared scattered among 4 chromosomes in human but was
clustered on chicken chr. 1 and on lizard chr. 5 (Figure
6), indicating that its partitioning occurred sometime
during the radiation of mammals. Also, the [TSHb]-containing paralogous gene set that was divided between
human chr. 1 and 6 was gathered on a definite segment
of chr. 4 in lizard and of chr. 26 in chicken (Table 1
and Additional file 7). Almost none of the genes of the
[LHb]-containing paralogous gene set either from chr.
19 or chr. X was localized in the lizard genome or
found in the chicken genome. However, as mentioned
above about LHb, and Lin7B, some of the products of

these genes have been cloned in chicken (and other bird
species): this is the case at least for GATA1 (GenBank:
NM_205464), ALAS2 (GenBank:M24367), BCAP31
(Manchester chicken EST data base: ChEST959H20)
and FLNA (GenBank:AB056474) that are located on
human chr. X (see Additional file 7) and of GYS1 (GenBank:AB090806) the gene associated with lhb and lin7b
on human chr. 19. It has been hypothesized that the
absence of these genes in the available genomic BAC
libraries could result from bias in genomic cloning procedure [36] or, owing to the occurrence of specific
repeats, to the difficulty in obtaining sequences from the
smallest micro-chromosomes [37,38].
The most compact paralogous gene set appeared to be
the one including [TSHb]. Despite its scattering into

of the data presented in Additional files 7 and 9 that shows the genomic distribution of the paralogous gene sets (tetra-paralogons) containing
the gph-related genes in the human genome and lists the most important scaffolds (genome version 2) where the amphioxus homologues are

three separated regions in human, it was contained into
a segment of 5 Mb in chicken and 35 Mb in the lizard
genome. A total of 227 gene families were identified, 96
with paralogues associated with [LHb], 130 with
[TSHb], 162 with [FSHb] and 185 with [GPHb-ghost].
Out of these 227 gene families, 199 were traced back to
amphioxus (Additional file 7). Ten scaffolds contain 97
homologues of the vertebrate gene families, 20 of them
being on scaffold V2_39, 13 on scaffold V2_158, 10 on
scaffolds V2_140 and V2_186, 8 on scaffold V2_220, 8
on V2_122 and 7 on scaffolds V2_41, V2_62, V2_230
and V2_279.
Recently, the comparison of the chromosomal organization of amphioxus genome with those of different vertebrates led to a tentative reconstruction into 17 protochromosomes of the last common chordate ancestor
genome [45] and to a partitioning of the human genome
into segments that showed defined patterns of fourfold
conserved synteny to those proto-chromosomes. Using a

different approach, Nakatani and collaborators [44] proposed a reconstruction of 10 (out of circa 10-13) protochromosomes of the ancestral vertebrate karyotype and
identified their resulting paralogous linkage blocks in
the human genome. In the human genome, the segmentations and boundaries of the four paralogous gene sets
identified in this study most often matched those that
were given as resulting from the partitioning of the
ancestral vertebrate proto-chromosome (proto-chr.) D
[44] (Additional file 8: Human [GPHb] tetra-paralogon
and ancestral chordate and vertebrate proto-chromosome relics). Only the segments on chr. X from the
[LHb]-containing paralogous set and the one on chr. 22
from the [GPHb-ghost] paralogous gene set were not
predicted to be derived from this ancestral vertebrate
proto-chromosome. Conversely, we did not find any
gene on chr. 20 that undoubtedly belonged to either
paralogous groups included in the paralogon. It was
more difficult to map the paralogous gene sets obtained

V2_124 (fgenesh2_pg.scaffold_629000011) but no other
genes were found in this scaffold that had orthologues in
gphb subunits environment. The ancestral lin7 gene might
thus have been translocated to the gphb subunit locus
after the divergence of the amphioxus lineage. An alternative hypothesis would be that lin7 had been specifically
translocated away from a nt/kcna locus sometime in the
branch leading to amphioxus. Two types of NT genes
were found in several ante-vertebrate chordates but a single one had the same genomic organization (the entire
coding region restricted to a single exon) as in vertebrates
[12]. It is located on scaffold V2_138 in amphioxus genome and is surrounded by other genes that have orthologues in the gphb genomic environments. Several
amphioxus kcna genes might potentially be homologous
to the ancestral vertebrate kcna: the first one [JGI:
gw94.169.1 or GenBank:XM_002597415] is located on
scaffold V2_157, close to homologues of genes that are in
the [GPHb] tetra-paralogon (Additional file 7); another
one, [JGI:gw.540.12.1 or GenBank:XM_002586434] is on
scaffold V2_279, also located next to genes related to
those in gphb environments; the third one, [JGI:e-

gw35.145.1 or GenBank:XM_002613506] is on scaffold
V2_6 that has numerous homologues in the paralogons
corresponding to the GPA2/GPB5 environment (see
below). All of these amphioxus kcna genes were encoded
by a single exon. None of them appeared to be closer than
the others to the vertebrate kcna genes by our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3). They may then represent specific
duplicates of kcna genes in the amphioxus lineage.
Another possibility, that seems less likely, is that vertebrate
KCNAs would have derived from two (or more) KCNAs
at the ancestral vertebrate level. A comparative analysis of
the KCNA environments on several chordate representatives would be necessary to address this question.
Origin of GPA2 and GPB5 genomic environments

Gpa2 and gpb5-related genes have been reported in all
vertebrate species analyzed so far with the exception of
birds that seem to lack gpa2 [22]. Since GPH subunits
are believed to originate from duplication of the ancestral form of these genes sometime before the radiation
of vertebrates, it was important to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the environment. We followed a similar approach as for the gphb subunits. This analysis
allowed us to identify 4 paralogous sets of genes. The
genomic environments were each part of one of gpa2
([GPA2]), gpb5 ([GPB5]), gpha ([GPHa]) were each part
one of these paralogous gene sets. The fourth one did
not contain any of the GPH subunit-related gene and
was referred to as [GP-Ghost] (Figure 5, Additional file

9: [GPHa-GPA2-GPB5] tetra-paralogon). The most
compact paralogous gene set was the [GPA2]-containing
one and was condensed into 6 Mb of human chr. 11.
Most of the corresponding genes were however not
placed in the current assembled genome of the lizard
and, as for the [LHb]-containing paralogous gene set
and likely because of the same difficulties, not found in
the current version of the chicken and turkey genomes.
The [GPHa]-containing paralogous gene set which was
scattered among 4 different chromosomes in the human
genome was found gathered onto chr. 3 in chicken and
most genes were spread over two regions of chr. 1 in
lizard (Figure 6, Table 1, Additional file 9). Similarly, the
[GPB5]-containing paralogous gene set distributed
between chr. 14 and 15 in human was restricted to a
short region of chr. 5 in chicken and of chr. 1 in lizard.

In the human genome, a total of 197 gene families
were identified, 171 associated with [GPHa], 164 with
[GPB5], 71 with [GPA2] and 80 with [GP-Ghost].
Among them 187 were recovered in amphioxus, 127
distributed among 6 scaffolds with 38 of them being
gathered on scaffold V2_6, 25 on V2_28 and V2_25, 14
on V2_161, 13 on V2_158 and 12 on V2_96 (Figure 5
and Additional file 9). It is to be noted that one scaffold,
scaffold 158, had genes that mapped to the two tetraparalogons with 13 genes involved in each of them.
They mostly came from scaffold 10 of version 1 of the
amphioxus genome with one end (up to 2.4 Mb) mapping to one tetra-paralogon and the other one to the
other tetra-paralogon. One of the genes (e_gw.10.14.1:
V2_158 EFEMP/FBLN), appeared to be homologous to
fbln-1 and 2 that are part of the [GPHb] tetra-paralogon

Santos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:332
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/332

and also to efemp-1 and 2 and fbln5 that are within
[GPHa-GPA2-GPB5] tetra-paralogon.
Boundaries of these paralogous gene sets corresponded quite accurately to those of the segments
described as resulting from the chordate proto-chr. 11
and from the vertebrate proto-chr. G (Additional file 8).
Reconstruction of the gpa/gpb evolutionary history

The present study provides strong evidence that
[GPHa], [GPA2] and [GPB5] environments derive from
an ancestral vertebrate locus through the two rounds of
WGD. The shared environment between gpha and gpa2
confirms the parental relationship previously suggested
from their structural and biochemical properties. The
shared environment between gpa2 and gpb5 confirms
that ancestral gpa and gpb were on the same locus
before the WGD strengthening the hypothesis that the
ancestral gphß together with gpha and vertebrate gpa2
with gpb5 were created by the duplication of a locus
containing the closely linked gpa and gpb. However, the
fact that the [GPHb] environments belong to a different
tetra-paralogon, ie derive from a different ancestral vertebrate locus, indicates that the ancestral b subunit gene
was transferred to a different locus before the two
rounds of WGD occurred. Another gene, the one corresponding to e_gw.10.14.1 in amphioxus (V2_158
EFEMP/FBLN) might have been duplicated in the same
duplication event as gpa and gpb. After the duplication
of this gene prior to the WGD, one of the duplicated
genes would have given rise to efemp-1 and 2 and fbln5
that are part of the [GPHa-GPA2-GPB5] tetra-paralogon. Its sister gene would have been transferred to a
locus close to the newly created ancestral gphb and
would have given rise to fbln-1 and 2 that are part of
the [GPHb] tetra-paralogon. It is then likely that gpagpb were duplicated with a very limited number of
genes among which could be the one homologous to
V2_158 EFEMP/FBLN and that the ancestral gphb was
transferred via translocation or partition of the newly
duplicated locus. Such a partition is indeed observed for
the amphioxus locus present on V2_158 that has one
part with homologues on the [GPHa-GPA2-GPB5]
tetra-paralogon and the other on the [GPHb] tetraparalogon.
Earlier phylogenetic reconstructions indicated closer
relationships between NTF4 and BDNF and between
NTF3 and NGF [8,46]. Sequence analysis of the GPHb
subunits led us to the same conclusion that LHb (which
is on the same environment as NTF4) was closer to
FSHb (BDNF environment) than either of them was to
TSHb (NGF environment) [2]. The same conclusions
about the relationships between these environments
where drawn when the history of the KCNA family was
explored [35]. The relationships between individual

Page 13 of 18

genes in these loci must apply for the entire corresponding paralogous gene sets. Accordingly, [LHb] and
[FSHb]-containing paralogous gene sets on the one
hand and [TSHb] and [GPHß-Ghost] paralogous gene
sets must have been generated from the duplication
associated with the 2nd WGD of two former paralogous
gene sets which themselves derived from the ancestral
vertebrate proto-chromosome with the 1 st WGD. In
order to establish similar type of relationships within
the gpa2/gpb5 tetra-paralogon, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated human protein
sequences of some of the genes that have all four paralogues in this paralogon (RTN(1-4), MAP3K(9-11),
MAP4K(1-3/5), ACTN(1-4), MARK(1-4), SIPA(1/L1-3),
KLC(1-4) and FOS(-/B/L1/L2)) using the amphioxus
homologues as the outgroup. The paralogous relationship between [GPHa] and [GPA2] paralogous gene sets
and between [GPB5] and [GP-Ghost] paralogous gene
sets were supported by bootstrap values (Maximum likelihood, 100 replicates) of 100 and 99, respectively (Figure 7).
The evolutionary scenario of the gpa2-gpb5 environment in Figure 8 was determined so as to match the
relationships between the paralogous gene sets. First,
gpa and gpb were located next to each other on the predicted ancestral chordate proto-chr. 11. Ancestral forms
of NT, Lin7 and KCNA must have been on a chordate
composite proto-chromosome 13/14. The gpa-gpb close
environment was then submitted to a specific, local
duplication, generating gpha and ancestral gphb subunits. This event took place between the radiation of urochordates (that do not have gpha and gphb but do have
a gpa-gpb locus) and the first round of genomic duplication. The environment must have then been split into
two loci, one located on vertebrate proto-chr. D, close
to the ancestral lin7, kcna and nt genes, and the other
one on vertebrate proto-chr. G. This locus was then
submitted to the two rounds of WGD to generate the
four [GPHb] environments as illustrated in more details
in Figure 4.
After the first round of genomic duplication of the vertebrate proto-chr. G, one copy of both gpa2 and gpha
was eliminated, leaving only one copy of each of them,
whereas two copies of gpb5 were conserved, one of which
still next to gpa2. The two loci were submitted to the second genomic duplication. One copy of gap2/gpb5 was
lost on what was now the [GPHa]-containing paralogous
gene set whereas the other copy of gpha was lost. A single copy of the gpa2-gpb5 linked genes was conserved in
early vertebrates and is still present in teleosts (Figure 9
and Additional file 10: [GPA2] and [GPB5] environments
in human and zebrafish). Indeed, most teleosts appear to
have two copies of gpb5, one (gpb5a) next to gpa2, and
the other one (gpb5b) in the same environment as

As shown in this study, the genes in the direct environment of amphioxus gpa and gpb do not map to the

tetrapod gpb5. In Xenopus, only one copy of gpb5
(e_gw1.491.6.1) is identified, located on a different scaffold as gpa2 (e_gw1.296.27.1). Both genes are in an environment syntenic with their mammalian counterparts
(data not shown). It is worth noticing that two copies of

Figure 9 Comparative genomic environment of gpa2 and gpb5. Genes are given with, underneath, their position in megabase pairs from
the p end of each chromosome (chr.) in human and zebrafish (zebra) (see Additional file 10 for details and links to Ensembl website).
Amphioxus (Amphi) homologues are given with the scaffold number (version 2) on which they are located. Names are after Ensembl in the
human genome except for amphioxus homologues, which were reduced. Duplicated chromosome fragments in zebrafish are indicated with
brackets. Due to rearrangements, the zebrafish gpb5b environment is scattered among chr. 13 and 17 whereas its FSGD driven duplicated
environment is on chr. 20. Human GPB5 is orthologous to zebrafish GPB5b, whereas zebrafish GPB5a environment is orthologous to that of
human GPA2.

gphb environments as it was postulated by Kubokawa
and collaborators [21]. The genes used for their study
were actn, pcnx, map3k (9-11), and map4k whose homologues actually map to the [GPHa-GPA2-GPB5] tetraparalogon (Additional file 9) and two other genes, kirrel
and pou2f whose homologues are effectively located on
human chr. 1 (156-172 Mb), chr. 11 (120-125 Mb) and
chr. 19 (41-47 Mb) but outside the boundaries of the
[GPHb] tetra-paralogon. Only the klhl28 (chr. 11: 45 Mb)
was actually within the boundaries of the [FSHb-containing paralogous gene set but this gene does not seem to
be paralogous at the vertebrate level to the two other
mentioned klhl20 (chr. 1: 172 Mb) and keap1 (chr. 19:
10Mb) that, in any case, are both located outside the
boundaries of any gphb paralogous gene sets.
Our present study also differs from a previous report
on the origin of neurotrophins by Hallböök and collaborators [9] in that they included in their neurotrophincontaining paralogous gene sets a number of genes that
actually were part of the [GPHb-GPA2-GPB5] tetraparalogon. This was likely due to the juxtaposition in
human of parts of the paralogous gene sets from the
two tetra-paralogons on chr. 1 ([TSHb: 200-210 Mb and
[GPHa]: 210-245 Mb), chr. 19 ([LHb:49-51 Mb and
[GP-Ghost]: 36-49 Mb), and chr. 11 ([FSHb:68-70 Mb
and [GPA2]: 61-67 Mb) that could have been misleading
at a time when most other vertebrate genomic data were
not available. Indeed, these paralogous regions do not
appear contiguous in lizard and chicken as exemplified
by [TSHb and [GPHa]-containing paralogous gene sets
that are located on different chromosomes in lizard
(chr. 4 and 1, respectively) and chicken (chr. 26 and 3,
respectively) (Additional file 8).

Conclusions
In this paper, we first investigated the repertoire for
gphb-related genes in cartilaginous fishes and lampreys,
and some genes that were kept in their genomic environment in teleosts and tetrapods. This analysis shows
that cartilaginous fishes are provided with the same set
of GPHb subunits as tetrapods. An additional tshbrelated gene is also found in the elephant shark C. milii.
In addition to four NT genes, a fifth, ntf4-related gene is
present in elephant shark. In lampreys, the only
observed gphb-related gene was the already known gthb.
In contrast, in addition to the previously characterized
NT1 we were able to identify two additional NT, NT2
and NTz in Petromyzon but their sequences were too
divergent for a reliable relationship with their tetrapod
counterparts to be established. These results are consistent with an evolution driven by two successive WGD
of a genomic region that contained a unique ancestral
form of each of gphb, nt, lin7 and kcna genes. To better
characterize this ancestral environment, we conducted
an analysis of the amphioxus genome and identified two
sets of scaffolds containing genes homologous to those
present in the environments of the vertebrate gphb and
in the environments of gpa2, gpb5 and gpha, respectively. By looking in vertebrate genomes for the location
of all the genes in these scaffolds, we identified chromosomal segments in human, chicken and lizard that constituted two different tetra-paralogons. This allowed us
to propose a scenario for the evolution of the GPH and
NT gene families within their environment in vertebrates. Vertebrate gpha and gphb were generated by a
local duplication of the ancestral forms of gpa2 and
gpb5, followed by a relocation of gphb into a new

Santos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:332
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/332

environment whereas gpha was retained in the gpa2gpb5 environment. Two rounds of WGD generated four
paralogues of each gene in the two ancestral environments but secondary gene losses or lineage-specific
duplications together with genomic rearrangements
altered the present, species-specific organization of these
genes.
