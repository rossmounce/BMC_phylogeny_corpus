Abstract
Background: Analysis of interspecific gene flow is crucial for the understanding of speciation
processes and maintenance of species integrity. Oaks (genus Quercus, Fagaceae) are among the
model species for the study of hybridization. Natural co-occurrence of four closely related oak
species is a very rare case in the temperate forests of Europe. We used both morphological
characters and genetic markers to characterize hybridization in a natural community situated in
west-central Romania and which consists of Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, and Q. frainetto,
respectively.
Results: On the basis of pubescence and leaf morphological characters ~94% of the sampled
individuals were assigned to pure species. Only 16 (~6%) individual trees exhibited intermediate
morphologies or a combination of characters of different species. Four chloroplast DNA
haplotypes were identified in the study area. The distribution of haplotypes within the white oak
complex showed substantial differences among species. However, the most common haplotypes
were present in all four species. Furthermore, based on a set of 7 isozyme and 6 microsatellite
markers and using a Bayesian admixture analysis without any a priori information on morphology
we found that four genetic clusters best fit the data. There was a very good correspondence of
each species with one of the inferred genetic clusters. The estimated introgression level varied
markedly between pairs of species ranging from 1.7% between Q. robur and Q. frainetto to 16.2%
between Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto. Only nine individuals (3.4%) appeared to be first-generation
hybrids.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that natural hybridization has occurred at relatively low rates. The
different levels of gene flow among species might be explained by differences in flowering time and
spatial position within the stand. In addition, a partial congruence between phenotypically and
genetically intermediate individuals was found, suggesting that intermediate appearance does not
necessarily mean hybridization. However, it appears that natural hybridization did not seriously
affect the species identity in this area of sympatry.

Background
Natural hybridization and introgression can play an
important role in evolution, e.g. by formation of new species or increasing genetic variation within species [1-3].
Hybridization is a quite common phenomenon in many
organismal groups, particularly in plants [4]. However,
the occurrence of natural hybridization is not universal,
but concentrated in a small fraction of plant families and
genera [4]. A well-known example is the genus Quercus
(the oaks), in which many species are known to hybridize
[5]. Because of their propensity to hybridize the biological
species concept based largely on effective genetic isolation
can not be applied to Quercus [6]. To overcome the problems with the reproductive species concept, another concept that relies on ecology was proposed with reference to
oaks [7].

number of sympatric oak species that coexist naturally at
different sites in the eastern part of the European continent (e.g., North Balkan) provides new opportunities to
investigate processes driving speciation, such as hybridization and introgression. Here, we examine a natural
community of four closely related oak species. In a companion paper [20] the genetic variation and differentiation among the species present at this site is described in
detail. The present paper will address the following questions: (i) does morphological grouping reflect the underlying genetic structure inferred from individual multilocus
genotypes? (ii) is there any evidence of hybridization and
introgression between species? (iii) is the level of introgression between species related to the non-random spatial distribution of oak species at this site?

Results
The occurrence of rare natural forms with intermediate
morphologies was often interpreted as the result of a
hybridization event. However, within oak species, morphology alone does not allow to detect putative hybrids,
since the parental species are not sufficiently distinct and
possess a wide variability [5]. For instance, no single morphological feature can unambiguously distinguish Q.
robur from Q. petraea. However, it is possible to differentiate two distinct groups and thus to identify intermediate
forms by using various multivariate analyses [e.g., [8,9]].
Furthermore, defining the limits between the 'typical' and
'intermediate' individuals is often more or less arbitrary
[9]. Morphologically intermediate forms which are suspected to be hybrids are regularly observed in natural
mixed populations (e.g., [10,11]).
Various types of genetic markers have been applied in
studies on hybridization of oaks. Chloroplast DNA studies revealed that the most frequent chloroplast DNA variants are shared among related oak species which was
interpreted as evidence for hybridization and introgression between taxa (e.g., [12-14]). Hybridization as a
mechanism of invasion by one species (Q. petraea) into
the range occupied by another species (Q. robur) through
pollen swamping was proposed to account for the lack of
differentiation between these two species [15,16]. However, a relatively low level of hybridization between Q.
robur and Q. petraea was detected by paternity analysis in
a mixed stand [17]. Studies of hybrid zones using morphology and molecular markers reported moderate levels
of gene flow between different oak species (e.g., [11,18]).
Recently, another study [19] suggested that low differentiation between Q. robur and Q. petraea results from shared
ancestral variation rather than high rates of gene flow.
So far, most of the studies dealing with hybridization in
oaks were carried out in mixed stands consisting of two
species (e.g., Q. robur and Q. petraea). However, the higher

Morphological analysis
Based on the assessment of six characters we were able to
identify 12 types of pubescence in the data set (Table 1).
The most frequent types (1, 2 and 3, respectively), with a
total frequency of 95.2%, correspond to those previously
described in Central Europe ([21], p. 77). These types are
taxa-specific and were used to discriminate between species. According to [21] a 'typical' Q. robur has neither stellate nor fasciculate hairs on the abaxial surface of the leaf
– type 1 in our study; the most common type of Q. petraea
has stellate hairs on the abaxial surface of the leaf and fasciculate hairs solely along the mid-rib – type 2; the 'typical' Q. pubescens has fasciculate hairs on the leaf, mid-rib,
petiole and twig, whereas stellate hairs are missing – type
3 (Table 1). Q. frainetto can not be distinguished from Q.
pubescens on the basis of pubescence alone. The individual
trees that exhibit type 1, 2 and 3 were classified in this
study as Q. robur sensu stricto (s.s.), Q. petraea s.s. and Q.
pubescens-Q frainetto s.s., respectively.

A total of 13 individuals failed to exhibit all character
states of the most common types, and were assigned to the
species that they mostly resemble – species in a broader
sense (sensu lato, s.l.). Within the Q. pubescens-Q. frainetto
group, the species were further discriminated following
Flora Europaea descriptions [22].
Each individual tree was classified to one of the four species based on the above mentioned procedure. Then we
continued applying a multivariate approach (stepwise discriminant analysis) based on 13 leaf characters to test the
first grouping of individuals to species. The discriminant
analysis revealed three distinct groups (Figure 1). The first
group consisted of all Q. robur s.s. individuals, two Q.
robur s.l. individuals (68 and 200), three Q. pubescens s.l.
individuals (24, 67 and 249) and one Q. petraea s.s. individual (64). The second group included Q. petraea and Q.
pubescens individuals, but also two Q. frainetto individuals

whereas the third group consisted of only Q. frainetto
trees. The first and the second discriminant function
accounted for 67.5% and 30.4% of the variation, respectively. Petiole ratio and basal shape of the lamina were the
most important characters in distinguishing between species. As expected, only two species, Q. petraea and Q.
pubescens, could not be discriminated on the basis of the
leaf morphology alone. Moreover, there was no unambiguous separation between Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto, and
consequently the assignment of trees showing intermediate discriminant scores may be subject to errors. In contrast, the separation between Q. robur and Q. frainetto was
complete (Figure 1).
In total, only six individuals were classified to other
groups (species) by applying the discriminant analysis as
compared to the grouping based on pubescence. Three
out of these six individuals were categorized as 'sensu lato'
in the pubescence analysis. According to the assessment of
pubescence and/or leaf morphology a total of 16 individuals (6.3%) revealed intermediate or contrasting character
states between two species and were considered as a separate group in the further genetic analysis (Table 2). The
number of unambiguously assigned (phenotypically
pure) individuals to Q. robur, Q. pubescens, Q. petraea and
Q. frainetto, was 65, 73, 65 and 50, respectively. Interestingly, most of the morphologically intermediate individuals were located in the contact zones between species
rather than in pure stands of one species or another (Figure 2).

Additionally, we applied the discriminant function proposed by [8] for distinguishing Q. robur from Q. petraea.
This function relies on only two leaf characters: petiole
length and number of intercalary veins. The species status
was confirmed for all individuals from our Q. robur and Q.
petraea sample, respectively. Moreover, as expected [8],
most of the Q. pubescens trees (94.5%) were classified as
Q. petraea.
Genetic analysis
A total of four chloroplast DNA haplotypes were found in
the white oak complex. The most frequent haplotypes, 5a
and 6, were identified in all species, although they were
not evenly distributed among oak species (Figure 3). Haplotype 6 was predominant in Q. petraea and haplotype 5a
in Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto, respectively. Interestingly,
42 (~65%) Q. robur individuals showed haplotype 5c,
which was not found in the three other species. A very rare
haplotype (6a) was confined to Q. petraea.

At microsatellite loci, among a total of 60 tests for linkage
disequilibrium between pairs of loci only 6 were significant (P < 0.05). For isozymes, among 84 tests only in 5
cases the linkage disequilibrium was significant. Markers
in significant linkage disequilibrium were only partly
located on the same linkage group. Only 2 out of 24 tests
for microsatellites (ssrQpZAG36 – Q. robur, P = 0.004;
MSQ13 – Q. pubescens, P = 0.04) and 2 out of 28 tests for
isozymes (Aap-A and Acp-C – Q. petraea, P = 0.03)
showed significant deviations from genotypic frequencies
expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [20]. Thus

Distribution
Distribution of the individual scores for the first two discriminant functions using 13 leaf morphological traits.
The initial taxonomic classification of the individual trees (shape and colour of symbols) was based on pubescence characteristics (separation of Q. robur, Q. petraea and Q. pubescens-Q. frainetto), and species descriptions of Flora Europaea (separation of Q.
pubescens from Q. frainetto). Nine putative first-generation hybrids and three misassigned individuals (54, 128 and 250) identified using the program STRUCTURE based on 13 genetic markers are shown by black and gray filled forms, respectively.

both categories of nuclear markers were considered to
meet the assumptions for applying the Bayesian method
implemented in the program STRUCTURE to assign individuals to species.
Assignment of individuals without any a priori information on
morphology
For the first modelling approach in the STRUCTURE program all individuals, morphologically pure species and
intermediates were combined into one data set, without
any a priori species assignment. Given X, the observed genotypes, the values of log likelihood of the multilocus genotype data, ln Pr(X|K), as a function of the number of
clusters, K, were as follows: ln Pr(X|K) = -10868 for K = 1,
ln Pr(X|K) = -10255 for K = 2, ln Pr(X|K) = -9851 for K =
3, ln Pr(X|K) = -9609 for K = 4, ln Pr(X|K) = -9635 for K =
5 and ln Pr(X|K) = -9683 for K = 6. The corresponding val-

ues for Pr(X|K) reach a maximum for K = 4. Consequently,
the STRUCTURE program determined that four genetic
clusters best fit the data in the species complex, which
agrees with the existence of four morphological groups.
There was a clear correspondence between the inferred
genetic cluster and the species designation (Figure 4A–D
and Additional file 1).
Within each phenotypically pure species an individual
was considered to be assigned to the corresponding species cluster when it has an equal to or greater than 0.90
probability of belonging to that cluster. Introgressed
forms are defined here as those showing less than 0.90
probability of belonging to their own species cluster and
more than 0.10 probability of belonging to other species
clusters. However, because our oak complex consists of
four species and the amount of genetic information may

be limited for some individuals, there were another two
cases: 17 individuals, evenly distributed across species,
showed less than 0.90 probability of belonging to their
own species cluster and also less than 0.10 probability of
belonging to other species clusters (e.g., individual 93,
which was assigned to Q. robur showed 0.78, 0.08, 0.05
and 0.09 probability of belonging to 'robur', 'petraea',
'pubescens' and 'frainetto' cluster, respectively); 4 individuals showed less than 0.90 probability of belonging to
their own species cluster and more than 0.10 probability
of belonging to two other clusters (e.g., individual 181,
which was assigned to Q. pubescens showed 0.19, 0.34,
0.04 and 0.43 probability of belonging to 'pubescens',
'robur', 'petraea' and 'frainetto' cluster, respectively).
These individuals were considered neither assigned nor
introgressed forms.
Following the above-mentioned classification scheme,
the fraction of individuals assigned correctly to their spe-

cies cluster varied among species, ranging from 80% for
Q. petraea to 64% for Q. frainetto. The amount of introgression varied markedly between pairs of species, however, ranging from 1.7% (2 out of 115) between Q. robur
and Q. frainetto to 16.2% (20 out of 123) between Q.
pubescens and Q. frainetto (Figure 4A–D). The differences
in the proportions of introgressive forms among species
combinations are only partly explained by the mean geographic distance between individuals from different species. Noteworthy, the proportion of introgressed trees
between Q. frainetto and Q. pubescens is not predictable
from the mean geographic distance between the individuals of the two species.
Evidence of apparently asymmetrical gene flow was found
between Q. petraea and Q. robur (1/6, the ratio between
the number of introgressed forms with Q. robur detected
among phenotypically pure Q. petraea and the number of
introgressed forms with Q. petraea detected among phe-

The results of the genetic assignment for individuals that
belong to the morphologically intermediate class are
shown in Table 2. The species designation based on leaf
morphology as compared to pubescence showed a higher
correlation with the genetic cluster indicated by STRUCTURE. However, there were only three instances of incongruent morphological and genetic marker discrimination.

generation hybrid between species. For this purpose, we
incorporated species information into the inference procedure. Each of the morphologically intermediate individuals was included into the species that it mostly
resembled. According to this second approach the vast
majority of individuals (95.5%) were assigned correctly, 9
individuals (3.4%) showed >0.50 probability of being
first-generation hybrids and only 3 individuals (1.1%)
were misassigned (ν = 0.10; Table 3). The probabilities of
being F1 hybrids were highly consistent across different ν
values in two instances (individual 9 and 320). However,
the other individuals still have moderate to high probabilities of being first generation hybrids at ν = 0.01. Q. pubescens was identified as parental species in 8 out of 9
putative first generation hybrids. Interestingly, only 4 out
of 9 putative F1 hybrids exhibited intermediate morphologies (Table 3). Accordingly, results from controlled
crosses suggested that physical appearance of hybrid individuals often resembles the morphology of the female
parent (e.g., [23]). Thus, nearly all putative F1 hybrids are
located in areas of contact between the parental species
and share the chloroplast haplotype with the neighbouring trees (Figure 5).

Incorporating additional information in the assignment procedure
Next, we tested in STRUCTURE whether any individual in
each species sample is misassigned, i.e. incongruence
between morphology and molecular markers, or is a first-

The number of misassigned individuals was very small relative to the total sample size (3 out of 269). However, for
individual no. 250 the probability of being misassigned to
Q. pubescens is very sensitive to the choice of ν, which indi-

Furthermore, there seems to be no relationship between
the chloroplast haplotype and the degree of admixture for
each individual within each species (see Figure 4A–D).
Only within Q. robur, the sub-group consisting of individuals with the chloroplast haplotype 5c, that is restricted to
Q. robur at this site (Figure 5), showed a higher proportion
of membership in the 'robur' cluster (0.931) relative to the
other sub-groups: Q. robur – H6 (0.887) and Q. robur –
H5a (0.855). This observation may support the hypothesis that Q. robur individuals containing the haplotype 5c
are the last 'immigrants' in the area and that there was less
opportunity for them to hybridize with other species.

cates that the amount of information in the genetic data is
not sufficient to draw strong conclusions. The phenotype
of this tree is typical for Q. robur (see Figure 1) ruling out
any possibility of wrong morphological assignment. Individual no. 250 is the only member of the Q. robur population that does not possess any copy of the 'diagnostic'
allele 136 bp at locus ssrQpZag96 [20] which may also
affect its genetic assignment. For the two other misassigned individuals (128 and 54), the probability of
belonging to Q. petraea and Q. frainetto, respectively, was
highly consistent irrespective of the ν value (Table 3)
showing a discrepancy between morphological and
genetic assignment. Indeed, it seems that the criterion
used for classifying individual 128 as Q. pubescens, fasciculate trichomes on the abaxial surface of the leaf, is not
always specific for Q. pubescens as suggested by Aas [21].
Individual 54 showed a marginal position in the Q. pubescens group and was very close to Q. frainetto according to
the results of the discriminant analysis (see Figure 1).

Discussion
By using pubescence and leaf morphological characters
we were able to distinguish between four closely related
oak species in an area of sympatry. Only a small portion

of individuals (~6%) could not be assigned unambiguously to one species or another and was categorized as
morphologically intermediate. Many studies report a
small number of individuals showing intermediate morphologies between Q. robur and Q. petraea (e.g., [810,24]). By contrast the morphological variation between
Q. pubescens and Q. petraea was seldom studied and the
results were contradictory. For example, a large proportion of morphologically intermediate forms between Q.
pubescens and Q. petraea was detected in north-eastern
France on the basis of thirty-four morphological traits
[10] and in Switzerland based on observations of trichomes on leaves and twigs [25,26]. Other studies using
pubescence and/or micromorphological characters differentiated very well Q. petraea from Q. pubescens in Central
Europe and Italy [21,27]. Our results concerning the morphological differences between Q. pubescens and Q.
petraea are consistent with the later studies. Reports of
intermediate forms between Q. robur and Q. pubescens are
very rare and rely on morphological observations [21]. We
found several individuals that were morphologically
intermediate between Q. robur and Q. pubescens and,
indeed, some of them (e.g., individual 67) were putative
genetic hybrids (Table 2). However, our observations sug-

gest that apparently intermediate phenotypes between
two species are not necessarily hybrids. Therefore, the
inference of hybridization based on morphological characters, especially in oaks which possess a wide intraspecific variability, remains limited and can lead to wrong
conclusions.
The presence of four differentiated morphological species
was strongly supported by the genetic analysis that also
identified the same number of genetic clusters. In addition, the majority of the individuals were assigned to the
species cluster they were classified based on morphology
(see Figure 4A–D). Our study provides no evidence for a
breakdown of species pairs into a hybrid swarm and indicates the existence of reproductive barriers among species.
However, the reproductive isolation is not complete, since
a substantial number of genetically intermediate individuals was detected within each phenotypically pure species. Interspecific gene flow and/or recent divergence of

the species with retention of ancestral polymorphism
(e.g., [19]) may explain the occurrence of these individuals. However, the spatial locations of nearly all putative F1
hybrids in contact zones between species (Figure 5) points
to interspecific hybridization as origin of genetically intermediate individuals. Even for one Q. frainetto individual
(no. 320), a putative F1 hybrid between Q. frainetto and Q.
pubescens, which appears to be located at a considerable
spatial distance of any Q. pubescens tree (Figure 5), several
Q. pubescens trees were observed in its south-western vicinity (location not shown in Figure 5). The predominant
location of introgressed forms in contact areas between
species has been reported in other studies on oak hybridization [11,28]. Contact areas might represent ecotones
for edaphic and hydrological parameters being more
favourable for the establishment of hybrids (e.g., [29]). At
Bejan, each oak species occupies a different ecological
niche and environmental variation is mentioned across
the site [30]. It was suggested that the success of an hybrid-

The fraction of putative F1 hybrids was very low in the
present study – 3.4% (9 out of 269). Only four of them
were previously classified as morphologically intermediates. Similar results were found in a mixed stand of Quer-

cus lobata and Q. douglasii in North America: only one of
the three individuals that showed the highest probability
of hybrid ancestry (0.20–0.25) was intermediate in
appearance [31]. Similarly, a very small fraction (2%) of
potentially F1 hybrids (those having a posterior probability of 40–60%) between Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica were
identified in a mixed stand in central Spain [28], but in
the absence of any morphologically intermediate tree.
Interestingly, the asymmetric introgressive gene flow from
Q. petraea to Q. robur is consistent with the model of
asymmetric hybridization between the two species [15].
Both species flower in synchrony when they cohabit in
mixed stands (e.g., [24]) and evidence of long distance
pollen transport was found [17]. Controlled crosses have
also demonstrated that Q. robur and Q. petraea are compatible and most of the hybrids were from the combination Q. robur (female) × Q. petraea (male) indicating a
lower success of Q. robur as pollen donor (e.g., [32,33]).
The rate of introgression between the two species was estimated at 6.1% which is relatively similar to the level of
interspecific gene flow (7.5%) detected by paternity analysis in a mixed stand [17].
This study provides no evidence of extensive hybridization between Q. robur and Q. frainetto. First, no morphologically intermediate tree between the two species was
observed at Bejan. Second, the estimated rate of introgression was the lowest among all pairs of species 1.7% (2 out
of 115). Our finding contradicts a phylogenetic study
based on ITS sequences in 12 Italian oak taxa that showed
a closer affinity between the two species as compared to
Q. petraea and Q. pubescens [34]. However, spatial arrangement of trees belonging to both species (Figure 1) and the
low density of Q. frainetto in the whole reserve may provide little opportunity for interspecific gene flow between
these two species. On the other hand, the study of Italian
oaks is based on only one individual sample from Q. robur
and Q. frainetto, respectively.
The highest amount of introgression 16.2% (20 out of
123) was observed between Q. frainetto and Q. pubescens.
This result is consistent with the chloroplast sharing
between the two species (Figure 3). According to
Schwarz's taxonomical scheme [35] both species are
grouped in section Dascia which may indicate a closer
affinity between Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto and a higher
propensity for hybridization relative to other species.
However, since the two species are not unambiguously
separated by morphological characters (see Figure 1), a
wrong a priori assignment of individuals to species may
bias the estimation of hybridization between the two species (see for example the case of individual 54 in Table 2).
The introgression between Q. pubescens and Q. petraea was
relatively high ~9.4% (13 out of 138) which is consistent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/218

with the low levels of genetic differentiation observed
between the two species in Italy [27] and at Bejan forest
[20]. Furthermore, pollination experiments revealed that
hybridization between Q. pubescens on the one hand and
Q. robur and Q. petraea on the other hand is possible [25].
An unambiguous genetic assessment of hybridization
rates within a species complex would require highly discriminatory markers [e.g., [36]]. Such markers are very
rare in the two white oak species, Q. robur and Q. petraea
[[19,37] and references therein]. The differences between
the two species derive mostly from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive genotypes. Even
though the nuclear genetic differentiation between Q.
robur and Q. petraea is low, the two species remain separate genetic entities across their natural range [38,39].
Considering the low linkage disequilibrium between
marker pairs and their wide genomic distribution [37,40]
even the limited number of nuclear markers (seven isozymes and six microsatellites) is expected to reflect
genome wide differentiation patterns among the four
investigated species.
Predominantly maternal effects, i.e. hybrids are more similar to the species of their maternal parent, may explain
the presence of introgressed forms amongst the phenotypically pure species [8,24]. It has been observed in controlled crosses between Q. robur and Q. petraea that first
generation hybrids at juvenile stage exhibited a leaf morphology that resembles the morphology of the female
parent very much [23]. However, it is unclear whether
these maternal effects persist at a later stage.
The maintenance of four distinct gene pools in an area of
sympatry may be explained by selection against hybrids
(e.g., [8,15]). The local site conditions would be more
favourable to the parental species rather than to the
F1hybrids, that are gradually eliminated until the adult
stage is reached (disruptive selection). Furthermore, the
small number of first generation hybrids compared to the
high number of potentially introgressed forms also suggests a lower F1 hybrid viability relative to other hybrid
classes. Those hybrids resulting from backcrossing are
more parental-like and would be better able than F1
hybrids to live under optimal environmental conditions
for one species or another. Our results are consistent with
other studies reporting a low fraction of first generation
hybrids relative to later generation hybrids in natural populations (e.g., [41]).
Differences in flowering phenology between species can
be a serious constraint for interspecific gene flow and may
account for the pattern of hybridization detected in this
species complex. Phenology was not directly assessed in
the study area, but observations on flowering time had

been carried out in several mixed stands consisting of Q.
robur and Q. petraea from the same geographical region
[42]. The data revealed a partial overlap of the flowering
period, with Q. robur starting flowering earlier than Q.
petraea. Unfortunately, phenological observations are
missing for Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto, respectively.

in the south-western part of the study plot and is also predominant in the rest of the nearby stands. Q. pubescens
grows on a sunny and relatively dry slope in the upper part
of the hillside, at the highest altitude. Q. frainetto, which
is an element of the (sub-) Mediterranean flora, tolerates
a heavy soil and is pretty well-adapted to xeric conditions.

Conclusion

A total of 269 white oak trees were mapped and sampled.
The sampling was exhaustive within an area of approximately 4.5 ha (the core-plot), with no a priori selection of
trees. Since Q. frainetto was less abundant within the core
plot, we extended the sampling for this species to the
nearby area outside of the core plot (Figure 2).

The present study has documented the occurrence of historical gene flow within a species-rich natural community
of oaks. There was a very good correspondence of each
morphological species with one of the inferred genetic
clusters. The amount of gene flow between species
appears to be at relatively low rates and does not represent
a 'threat' for the species identity which has been maintained in this area of sympatry. Genotyping of progenies
using highly variable microsatellite markers for paternity
analyses will provide information about the ongoing level
of gene flow between species. This will also enable us to
determine whether there is a decrease in hybrids' frequency between the seed and adult stage, due to selection
events. Moreover, collecting seeds and raising seedlings
from the putative first generation hybrids would allow
investigating the segregation of the morphological traits
involved in species differentiation.

Methods
Study area and plant material
Trees were sampled at Bejan Forest (45°51'N, 22°53'E),
an oak reserve situated at the foothill of the Carpathian
mountains in west-central Romania. The reserve is located
on a south-east facing hillside at an elevation of 250–380
m above sea level and experiences a continental climate
with Atlantic and sub-Mediterranean influences. Five oak
species in a broad sense (sensu lato) are common at Bejan:
four closely related species (known also as white oaks) –
Q. robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto, respectively – all belonging to section Quercus sensu stricto (s.s.)
and Q. cerris from section Quercus s.l. or "Cerris group"
[43,44]. Other two 'species', Q. dalechampii and Q. virgiliana, were also mentioned to occur in the reserve [30], but
these taxa are not easily distinguishable and their taxonomic ranking remains uncertain. Currently, the two taxa
are included in Q. petraea and Q. pubescens, respectively
(e.g., [45]). Q. cerris is not considered in this study since
no evidence of hybridization between Q. cerris and the
other four oak species was found so far [46,47].

A study plot was established in the species-richest part of
the reserve, which shows a pronounced environmental
variability [30]. Here, the oak species cohabit along a gradient of water and nutrient availability. Q. robur grows on
nutrient-rich and wetter soils in the eastern part of the
reserve at the bottom of the slope (Figure 2). In contrast,
Q. petraea prefers the more acidic and better drained soil

Morphological data
During the summer 2004, three to five (on average 4.2)
leaves and at least one current year shoot were sampled
within the upper crown of each tree. Leaves and shoots
were stored in a herbarium for further morphological
analysis. We applied two procedures: the first one was previously used for the separation of Q. robur, Q. petraea and
Q. pubescens in Central Europe on the basis of pubescence
alone [21]; the second approach considers leaf morphological traits and was used by [8] for distinguishing Q.
robur from Q. petraea. Pubescence was assessed with a stereomicroscope (×40) according to the procedure described
by [21]. Six characters were considered: stellate and fasciculate hairs on the abaxial surface of the leaves, fasciculate
hairs along and on the mid-rib, on the petiole and on the
twig, respectively. Each character was scored as 1 (present)
or 0 (absent) in order to determine different combinations of character states which are taxa specific [21]. Secondly, a suite of leaf morphological traits associated with
differences between Q. robur and Q. petraea [8] was
assessed in all individuals. These traits are dimensional
(lamina length, petiole length, lobe width, sinus width,
and length of lamina at the largest width); counted
(number of lobes and number of intercalary veins);
observed (basal shape of the lamina) and transformed
characters (lamina shape, petiole ratio, lobe depth ratio,
percentage venation and lobe width ratio). Based on these
characters a multivariate approach (discriminant analysis)
was carried out using the computer software STATISTICA
version 7.1. [48].
Genetic data
Chloroplast DNA, isozyme and microsatellite data used in
this study are described in detail elsewhere [20]. Nomenclature of the chloroplast variants follows that used in
European-wide inventories [13,46]. The seven enzyme
loci used were: acid phosphatase (Acp-C), alanine-aminopeptidase (Aap-A), aspartate aminotransferase (Aat-B),
isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh-B), menadione-reductase
(Mnr-A), 6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase (6-PgdhB), and phosphoglucose-isomerase (Pgi-B). The electro-

phoretic procedures and the verification of Mendelian
inheritance are given elsewhere [49,50]. Six nuclear microsatellite loci, linkage group in brackets (after [40,51])
were analysed: ssrQpZAG1/5 (7), ssrQpZAG9 (7),
ssrQpZAG36 (2) and ssrQpZAG104 (2) were developed for
Q. petraea [52], ssrQrZAG96 (10) was developed for Q.
robur [53] and MSQ13 (6) was developed for Q. macrocarpa [54], respectively. Details of the methods used for
DNA extraction, PCR amplifications, and microsatellite
genotyping are given in a companion paper [20].

To further test the morphological classification we conducted an analysis in GENECLASS2 [58]. We used a distance-based (Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards chord distance)
assignment method, which in contrast to the previous
method has the advantage of not assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or absence of linkage disequilibrium
among loci (e.g., [59]). Since the results of this assignment procedure were highly consistent with those generated using the Bayesian method (data not shown), only
STRUCTURE results are presented here.

Genetic assignment
We used the Bayesian model-based clustering method
implemented in the program STRUCTURE version 2.1
[55] to assign individuals to K populations (species in our
case) on the basis of individual multilocus genotypes.
This allowed us to analyze the correspondence between
the morphologically based species and inferred genetic
structure. We conducted a series of independent runs of
the Gibbs sampler for each value of K (the number of species) between 1 and 6. The results presented here are
based on runs of 106 iterations, following an initial burnin period of 30,000 iterations. Performing a series of trial
runs we found that using these parameters we obtained
consistent estimates of posterior probabilities of K. The
program was run without any information regarding species identification (USEPOPINFO = 0) and in the admixture mode in which the fraction of ancestry from each
cluster is estimated for each individual. We used the correlated allele frequency model, which often improves
clustering for closely related populations (species), but
may increase the risk of over-estimating the number of
clusters [56]. We thus continued our analysis to explore
how well this structure corresponded to our morphological assignment of individuals to species and to detect
putative hybrids, using prior information (USEPOPINFO
= 1). We ran the analysis at different values of 'immigration' rate ν ('hybridization' in our context), as recommended [55], in order to evaluate the robustness of results
to the choice of ν. We performed analyses for ν = 0.01,
0.05, and 0.10, which are considered as estimates for
hybridization within the European white oak complex,
based on data from paternity analysis at the same site
(Curtu et al. unpublished data) and on data in the literature [17]. We report the posterior probabilities that the
individual in question is correctly assigned to the given
species, or has ancestry in the other species. The Bayesian
clustering method requires that the marker-loci are
unlinked and at linkage equilibrium with one another
within populations [55]. Therefore, to verify the independence of our marker loci we analysed linkage disequilibrium for all pairs of loci in each species sample with
exact tests. The program GENEPOP version 3.4 [57] was
used for the computations.

In order to test whether the level of introgression between
species is simply a result of the spatial configuration of
oak species at this site, mean geographic distances
between species were calculated. GenAlEx6 software [60]
was used for calculating geographic distances between
individuals of the different species.
