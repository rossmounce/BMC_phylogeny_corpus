Abstract
Background: Lipocalins are a large and diverse family of small, mostly extracellular proteins
implicated in many important functions. This family has been studied in bacteria, invertebrate and
vertebrate animals but little is known about these proteins in plants. We recently reported the
identification and molecular characterization of the first true lipocalins from plants, including the
Apolipoprotein D ortholog AtTIL identified in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana. This study aimed
to determine its physiological role in planta.
Results: Our results demonstrate that the AtTIL lipocalin is involved in modulating tolerance to
oxidative stress. AtTIL knock-out plants are very sensitive to sudden drops in temperature and
paraquat treatment, and dark-grown plants die shortly after transfer to light. These plants
accumulate a high level of hydrogen peroxide and other ROS, which causes an oxidative stress that
is associated with a reduction in hypocotyl growth and sensitivity to light. Complementation of the
knock-out plants with the AtTIL cDNA restores the normal phenotype. On the other hand,
overexpression enhances tolerance to stress caused by freezing, paraquat and light. Moreover, this
overexpression delays flowering and maintains leaf greenness. Microarray analyses identified
several differentially-regulated genes encoding components of oxidative stress and energy balance.
Conclusion: This study provides the first functional evidence that a plant lipocalin is involved in
modulating tolerance to oxidative stress. These findings are in agreement with recently published
data showing that overexpression of ApoD enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and increases
life span in mice and Drosophila. Together, the three papers strongly support a similar function of
lipocalins in these evolutionary-distant species.

Background
Lipocalins are small ligand-binding proteins found in
bacteria and in invertebrate and vertebrate animals. Over
40 lipocalin members have been identified from all king-

doms [1]. They show a simple tertiary structure which
gives them the ability to bind small, generally hydrophobic, molecules. Animal lipocalins play important roles in
the regulation of immunological and developmental

processes, and they are involved in the responses of organisms to various stress factors and in signal transduction
pathways. It was recently shown that the insect glial
Lazarillo lipocalin (GLaz) possesses a protective role
against oxidative stress conditions and that its absence
increases lipid peroxydation, reduces life span and accelerates neurodegeneration in Drosophila [2]. On the other
hand, its overexpression protects against the effects of starvation, hypoxia and hyperoxia, and extends the fly's life
span [3].
Data mining of genomic databases and bioinformatic predictions allowed us to determine that plants also possess
lipocalins, which were classified as temperature-induced
lipocalins (TILs) and chloroplastic lipocalins (CHLs) [4].
The TIL genes are induced by high and low temperature
(LT) and their level of expression is associated with the
plant's capacity to develop freezing tolerance (FT). Furthermore, the accumulation of TIL transcripts is limited to
photosynthetic tissues and oscillates during the diurnal
cycle. TILs do not show any targeting peptide, but the proteins are found at the plasma membrane. Sequence, structure and phylogenetic analyses revealed that TIL proteins
share homology with three evolutionary related lipocalins: the bacterial lipocalin (Blc), the mammalian apolipoprotein D (ApoD), and the GLaz proteins.
In spite of the accumulating knowledge regarding the
molecular features of plant lipocalins, very little is known
about their function at the cellular and biochemical levels.
However, the TIL properties, their association with the
plasma membrane in photosynthetic tissues, and their
accumulation in response to temperature stress support
the hypothesis that these proteins may act as scavengers of
potentially harmful molecules known to be induced by
temperature stress and excess light [5]. In this report, we
characterized knock-out, complementation and overexpression lines to determine the cellular and biochemical
functions of the AtTIL lipocalin.

Results and discussion
AtTIL delays flowering and maintains leaf greenness
For functional analyses, four T-DNA lines carrying insertions in the AtTIL gene were analyzed to identify knockout (KO) lines (Fig. 1a) [see Additional file 1] [6]. The
SALK_136775 line carries a single insertion in the first
exon of the AtTIL gene and shows no detectable AtTIL
expression (Fig. 1b). Complementation of this KO line
restored AtTIL protein accumulation to a level about twofold higher than the wild-type (WT) plants (Fig. 1b,
Comp). Overexpression of the AtTIL cDNA resulted in a 4fold accumulation of the protein compared to the WT
(Fig. 1b, OEX). Under normal growth conditions, the
downregulation of AtTIL expression (KO) has no visible
effect on plant growth and development compared to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/86

WT (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the Comp and OEX lines show a
delay in flowering and a stay-green phenotype clearly visible at 45 and 52 days, respectively (Fig. 1c and 1d, Table
1). These data suggest that an increased AtTIL level
extends the vegetative phase and maintains leaf greenness.
To determine if AtTIL protein accumulation is modulated
during development, a western blot analysis was performed on samples prepared from tissues collected
throughout the WT plant's life cycle. The results show that
apart from the dry seeds stage, AtTIL is expressed at
approximately the same level at all stages of development
(Fig. 2a). Since there is no association between the protein
accumulation and normal flowering, and because there is
already a high level of protein before and during bolt
elongation, we hypothesize that an excess of AtTIL may
disrupt certain molecular events that ultimately delay the
transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase.
AtTIL enhances tolerance to freezing and oxidative stress
There are no noticeable morphological differences
between the different Arabidopsis lines when they are compared before (non-acclimated; NA) or after cold acclimation (CA) (Fig. 3a). After subjecting NA plants to a
freezing test at -6°C, a survival rate of 75% was obtained
for the wild-type (WT) and control (vector) plants (Fig.
3b). In contrast, only 50% of the KO plants survived while
the survival rate of the Comp and OEX plants was more
than 90%. Freezing treatment caused typical damage and
necrosis to the leaves of surviving WT and KO plants. On
the other hand, leaves of OEX plants showed no damage
after freezing and resumed vigourous growth when transferred to normal growth conditions at 20°C (Fig. 3a).
After 7 days of cold acclimation (CA7), the level of AtTIL
protein increases in all lines except in KO plants (Fig. 3c).
This indicates that AtTIL accumulation is associated with
an increased freezing tolerance that provides protection
against damages caused by a sudden drop in temperature.
On the other hand, the difference in sensitivity to freezing
between NA WT and KO plants is not observed when
plants are cold-acclimated prior to exposure to freezing
(CA7 -10°C, Fig. 3a). Additional freezing tests performed
down to -13°C did not reveal any differences between WT
and KO plants [see Additional file 2], suggesting that cold
acclimation is sufficient to provide maximal FT, and that
AtTIL is likely not essential when plants undergo the full
acclimation process. Protoplasts isolated from non acclimated lipocalin transgenic plants showed a higher survival rate compared to WT after freezing to -10°C. This
increase in survival rate was associated with a decrease in
the incidence of dehydration-induced injury [7].

The freeze-induced lesions may be caused by harmful
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated when plants are
exposed to freezing. To test the effect of ROS, plants were
treated with the oxidant paraquat, a powerful herbicide

that generates ROS [8-10]. After 7 days of treatment, KO
plants showed more necrotic lesions than WT plants,
whereas OEX plants were more resistant (Fig. 4a and 4b).
The effect of light stress on the different lines was monitored under different fluence rates (Fig. 5). Dark-grown
KO plants show a reduction in hypocotyl elongation that
is reversed in the Comp line, while OEX plants show
longer hypocotyls (Fig. 5a, upper panel). There is no difference in AtTIL accumulation between plants grown
under light or dark conditions (Fig. 2b). When darkgrown WT, Comp, OEX and control plants are transfered
to normal photoperiod and light conditions, greening
occurs and typical development resumes. In contrast,
dark-grown KO plants transferred to light do not accumulate chlorophyll and die shortly after (Fig. 5a, lower
panel). This suggests that the absence of lipocalin impairs
the plants' ability to adapt to a sudden light exposure.
There was no difference in growth and development when
plants of the different lines were grown under a normal
light-dark cycle (Fig. 5c, upper panel). Under a continuous moderate fluence of 100 μmol-1 sec-2, the different
lines show similar hypocotyl elongation but KO plants
have smaller cotyledons (Fig. 5d, upper panel). These data
indicate that in the absence of AtTIL, plants cannot tolerate the stress generated by continuous light and that a
dark period is needed for plants to recover. Staining with
3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) revealed that KO plants
grown under stress conditions (dark or continuous light
conditions) accumulate hydrogen peroxide and other
ROS (Fig. 5a middle panel, Fig. 5b, Fig. 5d middle and
lower panels) while KO plants grown under normal
growth conditions do not (Fig. 5c lower panel). A differential growth sensitivity was observed when plants were
grown under continuous low light. However, at moderate
fluence of 50 and 100 μmol-1 sec-2, the different lines
show similar hypocotyl elongation (Fig. 5e), but the KO
plants have small cotyledons as shown in Fig. 5D. It has
been shown that hydrogen peroxide accumulation causes
growth inhibition in maize and pine hypocotyls [11]. We
speculate that the higher basal level of peroxide and other
ROS in the KO plants is likely responsible for the higher
sensitivity to oxidative stress, which leads to a reduction in
hypocotyl growth and increased sensitivity to light. It was
reported that the inability to eliminate excess peroxide
increases sensitivity towards environmental stresses and
induces the expression of several stress-related genes [12].
Transcriptome analysis of AtTIL knock-out plants
Expression profiles were determined for WT and KO
plants grown under NA and CA conditions (7 days at
4°C). No differences in gene expression were observed
between the CA WT and CA KO, except for the absence of
AtTIL transcript in the KO line. However, 66 genes were
differentially regulated by more than 2-fold in the NA KO

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/86

compared to the NA WT (51 up and 15 down-regulated;
Table 2). Among these 66 genes, 49 are regulated in a similar manner (up or down) by LT exposure in WT plants
while 5 are regulated in an opposite manner. These genes
encode known or putative transcription factors or signal
transduction proteins, heat shock proteins, enzymes
involved in carbohydrate metabolism or oxidative stress
responses, and senescence and circadian clock-associated
proteins. The remaining 12 genes are regulated only in the
KO line (* in Table 2; KO-specific genes) and encode proteins that are associated with stress responses. This analysis indicates that without exposure to LT, the absence of
AtTIL mimicks part of the LT response. The accumulation
of hydrogen peroxide and other ROS in the KO plants
(Fig. 5) may act as a signal that triggers the changes
observed in gene expression. A similar finding was
reported for catalase-deficient plants under non-stressed
conditions [13]. It is known that hydrogen peroxide accumulation results in differential gene expression [14].
Several genes related to the disease resistance pathway are
overexpressed in the AtTIL KO plant. The WRKY54 gene is
known for its association with the defense response and
involves an increase in salicylic acid (SA), which accumulates during oxidative stress and mediates the induction of
defense response genes [15,16]. Similarly, the SigA binding protein is a homologue of MSK1 which was shown to
cause an accumulation of SA [17]. The At3g55450 protein
is most homologous to the BIK1 kinase which is induced
by ROS generators such as paraquat and proposed to play
a role in regulating optimal SA levels [18]. Induction of
the BIK1 kinase-like gene in AtTIL KO plants without
exposure to any stress suggests that the level of ROS is
higher than normal in these plants. The greater susceptibility to paraquat is also indicative that the AtTIL KO
plants are less capable of fighting additional oxidative
stress. Furthermore, the up-regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis protein in KO plants suggests that riboflavin
becomes limiting when AtTIL is absent. Since riboflavin
deficiency is associated with oxidative stress and is an
important component of FAD-requiring enzymes such as
glutathione reductase, it is possible that KO plants may try
to fight oxidative stress by increasing their level of riboflavin.
The microarray analysis suggests that in the KO plants,
starch synthesis is reduced while starch catabolism is
accelerated to provide additional soluble sugars needed to
fight oxidative stress. In addition, the Krebs cycle is inhibited under stress conditions, preventing the efficient utilization of the glycolysis products and thus affecting the
respiratory machinery [19]. To overcome this situation,
plants rely on the γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) shunt. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, the last enzyme of the
GABA shunt, is upregulated in AtTIL KO plants. The GABA

Animal lipocalins have been suggested to have a role in
restoring membrane integrity caused by oxidative stress,
likely by their binding to fatty acids [23]. This study provides evidence that the plasma membrane-associated
AtTIL lipocalin plays a role in protecting plants against the
oxidative stress induced by freezing, paraquat treatment
and light. We hypothesize that during oxidative stress,
lipocalins may bind and scavenge peroxidated lipids, and
thus help restore membrane integrity. Our findings are in
agreement with recently published data showing that
overexpression of ApoD enhances tolerance to oxidative
stress and increases life span in mice and Drosophila
[24,25]. The available evidence therefore point towards a
universal cellular function of lipocalins among species.

shunt is a bypass of the Krebs cycle which provides succinate and NADH to the respiratory machinery [20]. In
plants, the activity of this pathway is enhanced in
response to biotic and abiotic stresses [21,22] suggesting
a potential role in reducing the impact of oxidative stress
in mitochondria [19].

AtTIL lines
Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was the genetic
background of all the lines used. T-DNA knock-out (KO)
lines for the AtTIL gene were obtained from the Salk Institute Genome Analysis Laboratory http://signal.salk.edu/.
Seeds were sown on agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, stratified for 2 days at 4°C and grown at 22°C.
Kanamycin-resistant plants were propagated as individual
lines on potting medium consisting of two parts Arabidopsis growing medium PM-15-13 (LEHLE seeds), one part
vermiculite and one part black earth. Based on the segregation analysis of plants grown on antibiotic-containing
plates, lines putatively homozygous for the T-DNA insertion were subjected to PCR analysis using T-DNA-specific
(LBb1) and AtTIL-specific (RP) primers, and the resulting
PCR fragments were sequenced to determine the precise
insertion sites.

To generate the complementation (Comp) and overexpressing (OEX) lines, the AtTIL ORF was first cloned into
pRTL2, a vector that contains a double cauliflower mosaic
virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and a 35S terminator [26].
The resulting PRO35S:AtTIL:TERM35S cassette was then
cloned into the binary plant expression vector pPZP121
[27] and electroporated into Agrobacterium GV3101. KO
and WT Arabidopsis plants were transformed with this vector using the floral dipping method [28] to generate the

days at 20°C under long day conditions (16 hr light/8 hr
dark) at a photon flux density of 90 μmol m-2 sec-1. Seedlings were then transferred to 3.5 inches or 1.5 inches pots
containing potting medium and grown under the same
conditions as described above.
For low temperature treament, 3 week-old soil-grown
plants were transferred to 4°C for 7 days under the same
photoperiod conditions. For paraquat treatment,
paraquat (Sigma) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 15 μM and plants were sprayed once with this
solution until run off. Control plants were sprayed with
distilled water. After spraying, plants were grown for 7
days under normal conditions of temperature and photoperiod.
Determination of freezing tolerance
A Caltec Scientific Ltd. Model 8–792 Large Capacity Temperature Stress Chamber was used to perform the freezing

tolerance tests. This instrument consists of four major
component systems: a Sanyo Model MDF-792 24.75 ft3
capacity ultra-low temperature chest freezer, a custom
designed stainless steel plenum box with its integral
blower and heater (provides air circulation and heating)
and an Omega Engineering Inc. Model CN3002 programmable profile controller (monitors the test-chamber air
temperature and controls the heating element). The controlled action of the heater combines with the constant
cooling of the freezer to achieve the desired temperature
at any given time.
Non-acclimated (NA) and cold-acclimated (CA) soilgrown plants (3 weeks-old) were subjected to the following freezing regime. The plants were equilibrated at -1°C
for 2 hr and were seeded with ice chips to initiate freezing.
The temperature was then lowered gradually (2°C per hr)
to -6°C and maintained at this temperature for 6 hr. The
temperature was then gradually increased (2°C per hr) to

4°C. To determine temperature variability in the freezer,
temperatures were monitored by 6 independent thermocoupled T probes distributed in the freezer and connected
to an Agilent 3497-0A data acquisition/switch unit. Freezing regimes that showed more than 0.5°C discrepancies
between the different probes were rejected. To minimize
light stress effects after the freezing treatment, plants were
thawed at 4°C for 24 hr in the dark and away from direct
light in the growth chamber (20°C) for an additional 24
hr before returning to normal light conditions. Pictures
were taken 3 weeks after the freezing treatment. Eighteen
plants were frozen per line per assay, and the experiment
was repeated 3 times with independent biological replicates.
Hypocotyl analyses
Seeds were sown on sterile half strength Murashige and
Skoog medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and stratified in the dark
at 4°C for 6 days. They were then exposed to white light
(90 μmol m-2 s-1) at 20°C for 60 min and returned to
darkness for 23 hr before being exposed to varying fluence
rates at 20°C for 7 days. Hypocotyl length was measured
using the Image J 1.36b software (mean ± SD; n = 40).
H2O2 and other ROS were detected in situ by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining as described [29].
Protein isolation and immmunoblot analysis
The antibody raised against the wheat TaTIL lipocalin protein (4) does not cross react with the Arabidopsis AtTIL
lipocalin, therefore it was necessary to raise a specific antibody against the latter. The AtTIL cDNA was cloned in the
pTrc-HIS vector (Invitrogen) and electroporated into the
E. coli strain DH5α. The recombinant HIS::AtTIL protein
was produced by induction with 1 mM IPTG for 3 hr. The
cells were collected, broken by lysozyme treatment and
sonication, and HIS-tagged proteins were purified by
immobilized metal affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA
agarose (Novagen). The purified proteins were more than
90% pure and used to immunize a rabbit to obtain polyclonal antibodies.

Aerial parts of the Arabidopsis plants were cut and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. One hundred milligrams
of leaf material was processed as one sample. Proteins
were isolated using Tri Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Samples were separated on
12% SDS-PAGE gels and the rabbit anti-AtTIL antibody
(1:10,000) was used for the immunoblot analysis. Detection was performed with a peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit
IgG secondary antibody (1:25,000) and the Western
Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer).

PCR and Southern blot analyses
Genomic DNA was extracted from flower buds of the different Arabidopsis lines. PCR analysis was performed
according to the SIGnAL protocol using the recommended primers designed with the SIGnAL iSect Primer
Design sofware: LBb1 (5' GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT 3'), LP (5' CTGGATCCAGAGATGAAGTCG 3')
and RP (5' AAGACGTGTATGGTACCGTCG 3'). For Southern analysis, the DNA (5 μg) was digested by PciI (New
England Biolabs) and fractionated by electrophoresis on a
0.7% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane and
hybridized with 32P-labeled probes corresponding to the
T-DNA of pROK2 (vector used to generate the SALK lines)
or the T-DNA of the 35S:AtTIL vector. The following
primer pairs were used for amplification of the fragments
used as probes: 5'-CAGCAAAATCACCAGTAGCACCATTACCAT-3' and 5'-GCGATAGAAAACAAAATATAGCGCGCAAAC-3' for the pROK2 T-DNA, and 5'ACGAAACGTGGAGCAACGGGAAGAG-3' and 5'-TGCACATACAAATGGACGAACGGATAAACC -3' for the AtTIL
T-DNA. All filters were washed at high stringency (0.1×
SSC, 0.1% SDS), exposed to K screens (Kodak) and analyzed on a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad).
Transcriptome analysis
Non-acclimated and cold-acclimated WT and KO plants
were used for microarray analysis. For each sample, three
independent biological replicates of 25 plants were harvested for RNA isolation. RNA quality assessment and
hybridization to the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis
ATH1 Genome Arrays were performed at the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre (Montreal
QC Canada). Data accumulation and analysis were performed using the Robust Multi-array Average analysis
(RMA) [30], and data was deposited in the ArrayExpress
database [ArrayExpress:E-TABM-430]. An analysis of variance was performed using GraphPad InStat 3 to select
genes that are significantly differentially expressed by at
least two-fold under the conditions specified for each
analysis (4°C vs 22°C and KO vs WT). Functional classification of the genes was done according to their annotation in the TAIR database http://www.arabidopsis.org/
tools/bulk/go/index.jsp, by BLAST search of the NCBI
database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi
and by literature search performed using the gene name
and annotation. RT-PCR analyses of AtTIL and randomly
selected transcripts were performed to confirm the
absence of AtTIL expression in the KO plants and to validate the microarray results [see Additional file 3].
