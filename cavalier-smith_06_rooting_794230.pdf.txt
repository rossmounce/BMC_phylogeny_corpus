Abstract
Background: Despite great advances in clarifying the family tree of life, it is still not agreed where its root is or what properties
the most ancient cells possessed – the most difficult problems in phylogeny. Protein paralogue trees can theoretically place the
root, but are contradictory because of tree-reconstruction artefacts or poor resolution; ribosome-related and DNA-handling
enzymes suggested one between neomura (eukaryotes plus archaebacteria) and eubacteria, whereas metabolic enzymes often
place it within eubacteria but in contradictory places. Palaeontology shows that eubacteria are much more ancient than
eukaryotes, and, together with phylogenetic evidence that archaebacteria are sisters not ancestral to eukaryotes, implies that
the root is not within the neomura. Transition analysis, involving comparative/developmental and selective arguments, can
polarize major transitions and thereby systematically exclude the root from major clades possessing derived characters and thus
locate it; previously the 20 shared neomuran characters were thus argued to be derived, but whether the root was within
eubacteria or between them and archaebacteria remained controversial.
Results: I analyze 13 major transitions within eubacteria, showing how they can all be congruently polarized. I infer the first
fully resolved prokaryote tree, with a basal stem comprising the new infrakingdom Glidobacteria (Chlorobacteria, Hadobacteria,
Cyanobacteria), which is entirely non-flagellate and probably ancestrally had gliding motility, and two derived branches
(Gracilicutes and Unibacteria/Eurybacteria) that diverged immediately following the origin of flagella. Proteasome evolution
shows that the universal root is outside a clade comprising neomura and Actinomycetales (proteates), and thus lies within other
eubacteria, contrary to a widespread assumption that it is between eubacteria and neomura. Cell wall and flagellar evolution
independently locate the root outside Posibacteria (Actinobacteria and Endobacteria), and thus among negibacteria with two
membranes. Posibacteria are derived from Eurybacteria and ancestral to neomura. RNA polymerase and other insertions
strongly favour the monophyly of Gracilicutes (Proteobacteria, Planctobacteria, Sphingobacteria, Spirochaetes). Evolution of the
negibacterial outer membrane places the root within Eobacteria (Hadobacteria and Chlorobacteria, both primitively without
lipopolysaccharide): as all phyla possessing the outer membrane β-barrel protein Omp85 are highly probably derived, the root
lies between them and Chlorobacteria, the only negibacteria without Omp85, or possibly within Chlorobacteria.
Conclusion: Chlorobacteria are probably the oldest and Archaebacteria the youngest bacteria, with Posibacteria of
intermediate age, requiring radical reassessment of dominant views of bacterial evolution. The last ancestor of all life was a
eubacterium with acyl-ester membrane lipids, large genome, murein peptidoglycan walls, and fully developed eubacterial
molecular biology and cell division. It was a non-flagellate negibacterium with two membranes, probably a photosynthetic green
non-sulphur bacterium with relatively primitive secretory machinery, not a heterotrophic posibacterium with one membrane.

Background
Correctly placing the root of the evolutionary tree of all
life would enable us to deduce rigorously the major characteristics of the last common ancestor of life. It is probably the most difficult problem of all in phylogenetics, but
not yet solved – contrary to widespread assumptions
[1,2]. It is also most important to solve correctly because
the result colours all interpretations of evolutionary history, influencing ideas of which features are primitive or
derived and which branches are deeper and more ancient
than others [1]. The wrong answer misleads profoundly in
numerous ways. Establishing the root of a small part of
the tree is more straightforward, yet often surprisingly difficult for organisms without plentiful fossils [3,4]. Usually
the root of a subtree is located by comparisons with
known outgroups. However, outgroups for the entire tree
are air, rocks and water, not other organisms, vastly
increasing the problem, which uniquely involves the origin of life – not just transitions between known types of
organism. Here I explain how this seemingly intractable
problem can be solved by supplementing standard molecular phylogenetic methods with the very same conceptual
methods that were originally used to establish 'known
outgroups' in well-defined parts of the tree, long before
sequencing was invented. I then apply these methods
comprehensively to establish far more closely than ever
before where the root of the tree of life actually is.
I show here that, in conjunction with palaeontology and
sequence trees, the methods of transition analysis and
congruence testing demonstrate that archaebacteria are
the youngest bacterial phylum and that the root lies
within eubacteria, specifically among negibacteria of the
superphylum Eobacteria, probably between Chlorobacteria and all other living organisms (Table 1 summarizes the
prokaryotic nomenclature used here, which is slightly
revised from previously [1], primarily by excluding Eurybacteria from Posibacteria). Chlorobacteria comprise
photosynthetic 'non-sulphur' green bacteria like Chloroflexus and Heliothrix, some little-studied heterotrophs
(e.g. Thermomicrobium, Dehalococcoides) and some apparently deeper-branching lineages known only from environmental DNA sequences and thus of unknown
properties [1]. I use cladistic and transition analysis to
provide the first rooted and fully resolved tree for all ten
phyla of bacteria recognized here.
I also provide new perspectives on the evolution of bacterial flagella and the cell envelope and conclude that the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

last common ancestor (cenancestor) of all life was a
highly developed non-flagellate Gram-negative eubacterium with murein cell walls, acyl ester phospholipids, and
probably non-oxygenic photosynthesis and gliding motility. It was more primitive than other eubacteria in probably lacking lipopolysaccharide, hopanoids, cytochrome b,
catalase, the HslV ring protease homologue of proteasomes, spores, the machinery based on outer membrane
(OM) protein Omp85 used by more advanced negibacteria to insert outer membrane proteins, type I, type II, and
type III secretion mechanisms, and TonB-energized OM
import systems. I briefly discuss implications of this novel
rooting of the universal tree for understanding primordial
cell biology and the history of life and its impact on global
climate.
The primacy of transition analysis
Classically three types of argument have been used to distinguish in-groups and out-groups. First, the fossil record.
Among vertebrates, birds and mammals must be derived
from reptiles, not vice versa, because reptile fossils are so
much earlier. Likewise reptiles are derived from amphibians that were objectively earlier, amphibians from bony
fish as fish are more ancient.

Second is transition analysis [5], which can often polarize
major changes, showing that A went to B, not B to A. Thus,
when birds originated, forelimbs previously used for
walking were transformed into wings. We rule out the
reverse by comparative/developmental and selective arguments. 18th century comparisons showed the structural
and developmental homology of all pentadactyl limbs.
Before palaeontology gave a time scale and evidence of
direction it was obvious that wings were specializations of
legs, not the reverse. Fore and hind limbs were clearly
homologous throughout tetrapods; they must first have
been essentially the same, as in amphibians and reptiles,
not highly differentiated as in birds. It would be impossible mechanistically (developmentally or mutationally) to
have evolved the very different bird wing and leg as the
first tetrapod limbs – subsequent derivation of essentially
similar reptilian five-toed legs from each would be equally
improbable: that scenario would place birds at the tetrapod root; to become reptiles they would have to separate
their fused trunk skeletons into discrete bones, convert
feathers to scales, and evolve teeth. Such changes would
be mechanistically complex, difficult, and of no selective
advantage.
Transition analysis, if imaginative and critical, often
clearly polarizes change unambiguously in the complete
absence of a fossil record. Fossils are static and discontinuous; they do not show transitions or continuity directly
and can be interpreted properly only by critical transition
analysis, which is therefore the most fundamental way to

* The 10 taxa shown in bold are ranked as phyla. A more detailed classification is given later in the paper, when I explain the small improvements
over the previous system [1].
In addition to the taxa listed, three informal names are used for the following higher groups:
glycobacteria (a paraphyletic grade) = Cyanobacteria + Eurybacteria + Gracilicutes
proteates (a clade) = Actinomycetales + Archaebacteria + Eukaryota
neomura (a clade) = Archaebacteria + Eukaryota

polarize the direction of evolutionary change. For vertebrate evolution the fossil record is a valuable extra, inessential benefit. It is important to note that not all
transitions can be clearly polarized when studied individually. Some evolutionary changes can in principle occur
in either direction; evolutionary direction in such cases
can only be established by reference to other changes that
can be polarized and their relationship to the topology of
the tree. It is the subset of changes that have a sufficient
degree of complexity to allow unambiguous polarization
that are of key importance for rooting trees. The key question that decides the utility of a particular character for
this purpose is whether its evolution has enough evidence
of directionality, which may be inherent in the process of
evolutionary change itself or deducible by comparison
between an evolved state and its putative precursors and
knowledge of their phylogenetic distribution. Without
evidence of directionality a character cannot be used
clearly to polarize the tree.

I call the third approach congruence testing. One searches
for congruence across major parts of the evolutionary tree
between what analyses of individual transitions tell us, to
ensure that the whole story is consistent; consistent historically and compatible with comparative morphology,
genetics, developmental biology, and ecology. Thus in
reptiles not only the ancestors of snakes but numerous
different lizard groups lost limbs. Consistency across the
whole tetrapod tree excludes its root from any group of
limbless reptile. In unicellular organisms character losses
have been equally confusing; yet though useful morphological characters are fewer, transition and congruence
testing eventually enable losses to be identified and polarize transitions, especially by adding molecular cladistic
characters [1,6]. Historically, biologists studying macroorganisms worked on many parts of the tree at once, using
cross comparisons to hone arguments and criteria; such
critical evaluation rejected discordant scenarios and subhypotheses. With congruence testing a serious mistake in
one part of the tree may be revealed by incongruence with

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

other parts. If two polarizations in different parts of the
tree are incongruent (contradictory), then either the
topology of the tree is incorrect or one of the polarizations
is incorrect, and the source of the conflict can be sought
for and at least one of the interpretations corrected in the
light of the overall evidence from as many sources as possible. Usually it will be found that one of the lines of evidence is weaker than the others and has been given too
much weight or is positively misleading or fundamentally
misinterpreted. Search for congruence among multiple
lines of evidence – the more diverse the better and resolving apparent contradictions by weighing up the evidence
is not special to evolutionary biology but fundamental to
all science. Its importance is easily overlooked by specialists familiar with only one field. Gaucher et al. [7] have
rightly stressed that such an integrative approach, though
recently unfashionable, is sorely needed in the face of the
mass of new genomic data to suggest biologically wellgrounded hypotheses to guide detailed experimental studies in the laboratory.
Problems with sequence trees
Recent discussions about the root of the universal tree
mostly fail to consider any palaeontological evidence or
execute either transition analysis, or congruence testing
and focus solely on sequence trees. Single-gene trees,
notably of rRNA and unusually well-conserved proteins
like cytochromes, RuBisCO and chaperones, have been
valuable in clustering together relatively closely related
organisms, especially if morphology was inadequate to
establish their closest relatives (often because of character
losses). Occasionally they made major breakthroughs, as
in the recognition of Archaebacteria and Proteobacteria in
prokaryotes and Cercozoa in protozoa [8]. Unfortunately,
such trees have four serious limitations. First is limited
resolution, especially for basal eukaryotes and prokaryotes, where branching order is almost totally unresolved
and must be established otherwise. Second is pervasive
systematic biases in evolutionary mode, which affect segments of the tree differentially causing some branches to
be placed entirely incorrectly [2]; all sequence trees
require testing and corroboration by other evidence. Such
testing is sophisticated in the eukaryote part of the tree
now [6], but for prokaryotes a regrettable tendency to take
16S rRNA trees as gospel truth and ignore other evidence
persists; critical cladistic analyses are rare [1,9,10].
Thirdly, lateral gene transfer, commoner in bacteria than
eukaryotes, but of uneven frequency, also places occasional branches incorrectly on single-gene trees [11,12].
Fourthly, single-gene trees are always unrooted, lacking
inherent evidence of direction; any nucleotide can substitute reversibly for any other. These severe limitations of
sequence trees emphatically do not mean that they are
worthless. On the contrary, they are indispensable, but
they must be interpreted critically and supplemented by

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

cladistic, transition analysis and congruence testing, and
by critical palaeontology, in order to produce a reliable
and comprehensive picture. Some perceptive molecular
biologists now appreciate the need to integrate sequence
trees into the broader and time-based framework provided by palaeontology [7]. This synthetic approach to the
history of life should become much more widespread [7].
Paralogue rooting failed clearly to root the tree
Gene duplications can in principle be used to root a subtree like eukaryotes or the whole tree of life. If duplication
was just prior to the last common ancestor of a group and
all descendants retain both paralogues, data from both
can be combined in one tree. In theory, each paralogue
would give an identical tree, with both trees linked by a
line connecting their roots (Fig. 1a). In practice paralogue
rooting is highly problematic; different gene pairs put
roots in contradictory places and the two subtrees may not
be identical [13] (Fig. 1b). This is because double trees are
subject to systematic biases and/or poor resolution like
single-gene trees [1]. For many paralogue pairs these problems are worse than most single-gene trees; this arises
because most paralogues kept in all descendants of a particular ancestor underwent temporary dramatically elevated rates of change immediately following duplication
when their contrasting functions that allowed both to survive originated [1]. For two proteins in the same cell compartment (virtually all in bacteria) this general principle
(analogous to ecological limiting similarity dictating species coexistence [14]) makes transiently hyper-fast early
divergence between paralogues almost inevitable. Thus
sister paralogues are each very long branches on the twin
tree [15,16] that evolve with different constraints: the
worst combination of properties for accurate phylogenetic
construction [1,2]. Any lineage of either or both paralogues that underwent similar major changes in rate or
mode will be put artifactually closer to the apparent root
than is correct. Interesting possible exceptions, which
might give sensible roots, are sister paralogues retaining
almost the same functions in separate compartments, e.g.
cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Hsp90 [17].

I previously highlighted two contrasting classes of universal paralogue tree [1]. Those for metabolic enzymes
mostly place the root within eubacteria (in conflicting
places with different enzymes [18]) and show weak support for monophyly of archaebacteria, which nest within
eubacteria. In sharp contrast, trees for DNA-handling
enzymes, molecules associated with ribosomes [15], and
a few others, e.g. membrane ATPase [16], typically place
the root on a very long stem that separates archaebacteria
and eubacteria into unambiguously distinct branches. The
latter trees are the minority but have often ('somewhat
surprisingly': [2]) been accepted as genuinely locating the
root, and the conflicting majority showing eubacterial

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

roots ignored [19,20]. Such neglect of important conflicting evidence and of other approaches that may be more
productive stems from the first paralogue trees used for
rooting being of the minority type [15,16] and from a perceived fit to long-standing assumptions (devoid of sound
evidence) that archaebacteria are as ancient as eubacteria.
Instead of ignoring conflicting evidence, we need to
understand why the trees differ and which most reliably
locates the root. In essence, we are caught between the
Scylla of strongly systematically-biased molecules that
give the wrong root with high confidence and the Charybdis of less-biased, weakly-resolving molecules that give
the right and several wrong versions of the root with too
little support to distinguish them [1]; transition analysis,
if critically applied, can pilot us into safer waters.
Although it may not give the absolute certainty that some
crave, it can allow us to reconstruct the past history of life
with much higher confidence than anyone would have
dreamed of a few decades ago.

Figure 1
The logic and problems of paralogue rooting
The logic and problems of paralogue rooting. In theory (A),
two genes that arose from a single parent by duplication
immediately prior to the common ancestor of the group
under study should yield two identical trees joined together
by a line (shown extra thick) between the roots (stars) of
each tree. Letters are taxa. In practice (B), stochasticity and
systematic biases in evolutionary modes and rates yield trees
with partially incorrect topology and often-misplaced roots
[1]. Misplaced branches (red) are shown as extra long, but in
practice misplaced taxa often do not reveal themselves so
neatly. In practice, root positions in paralogue subtrees may
both be right (very rare: I recall no examples), both wrong
but the same (implying strong systematic biases), both wrong
but different (often reflecting stochasticity and poor resolution), or one right and one wrong. When such conflicts
occur among different paralogue pairs (or triples, etc.), as is
almost invariable, other means are required to decide
between them.

Cladistic analysis of discrete characters can improve the
resolution of ambiguous trees
Molecular sequence trees have not established the branching order of the nine eubacterial phyla recognized here
(Table 1). Basal resolution of single-gene trees like 16S
rRNA is totally inadequate. Multi-gene trees and genomic
trees confirm most major clusters indicated by single-gene
trees, but lack resolution in most key areas and are still too
weakly sampled taxonomically [21-23], with Chlorobacteria still unrepresented (the first to include a chlorobacterium appeared during review of this paper; it is
remarkably congruent with the present analysis if properly rooted and is discussed in responses to referee 3).
Some evolutionarily key organisms are greatly neglected.
A worse problem with multiple-gene trees is genome-wide
systematic biases that can give the wrong topology with
increasing confidence as data are added [2]. Cladistic reasoning about unique or rare changes has a special role in
formulating and testing relationships, having been decisive in eukaryotes, e.g. in creating and strongly corroborating the chromalveolate theory [24-26] and locating the
root of the eukaryotic subtree [3,4,6]. The value of such
characters depends on their complexity and rareness. Ideally one prefers congruence among several; when congruent they may be sounder than many genome-wide
comparisons. This paper uses rare discrete characters to
establish unambiguously the branching order among the
10 eubacterial phyla, and to establish the monophyly of
Posibacteria, by seeking synapomorphies that group them
together in the same way as has been very successful in
eukaryotes [3,4,6,27,28].

Multiple transition analyses of complex multimolecular
characters can root the tree
Figure 2 emphasizes that the most fundamental question
concerning the root of the tree of life is whether the ancestral cell had two bounding membranes (i.e. was a negibac-

terium, as argued here) or just one membrane as in
archaebacteria and posibacteria (collectively therefore
called unibacteria [1]), as has traditionally been widely
assumed. To decide this one must correctly polarize the
transition between cells that have two membranes (most

Figure 2
Evolutionary relationships among the four major kinds of cell
Evolutionary relationships among the four major kinds of cell. The horizontal red arrow indicates the position of the universal
root as inferred from the first protein paralogue trees, i.e. between neomura and eubacteria. To determine whether the root
is really there or within eubacteria, as suggested instead by many paralogue trees for metabolic enzymes, we must correctly
polarize the direction of the negibacteria/posibacteria transition that took place in bacteria that had already evolved flagella. As
argued in detail in the text, flagellar evolution and wall/envelope evolution both strongly favour a transition from negibacteria
to posibacteria (continuous black arrow), not from posibacteria to negibacteria (broken red arrow). This places the root
within Negibacteria and shows that the ancestral cell had two bounding membranes, not just one as traditionally assumed. A
negibacterial root also fits the fossil record, which shows that Negibacteria are more than twice as old as eukaryotes [1, 129].
As negibacteria are the only prokaryotes that use sunlight to fix carbon dioxide this is also the only position that would have
allowed the first ecosystems to have been based on photosynthesis, without which extensive evolution might have been impossible. Posibacteria, archaebacteria and eukaryotes were probably all ancestrally heterotrophs, whereas negibacteria are likely to
have been ancestrally photosynthetic and diversified by evolving all the known types of photosystem and major antenna pigments.

Table 2: The 10 phyla (=divisions) of the kingdom Bacteria* recognized here (Continued)

Informal names are mostly as used in GenBank. The formal, validly published names are explained in detail in [1] with key defining characters,
except for four modifications here, i.e. accepting Eurybacteria [69] as a genuine, but slightly revised, phylum and Selenobacteria as a class (originally
phylum [142]), placing both Selenobacteria and Thermotogales in Eurybacteria, and revising the circumscription of Gracilicutes. I use the name
Proteobacteria more broadly than usual to include also Geobacteria and Aquificales [1]. All 10 phyla are monophyletic on the backbone bacterial
tree http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/, except for Posibacteria and Proteobacteria (the grouping there of typical ε-proteobacteria with Sphingobacteria and
exclusion of Geobacteria from Proteobacteria are all arguably artefacts of tree reconstruction related to the almost non-existent resolution at the
base of eubacteria on single-gene trees [1]) and the artifactual attraction of the hyperthermophiles Aquifex and Thermotoga towards the long-branch
archaebacterial outgroup. The latter artifactual attraction is not seen on a 31 protein 191 species tree [175] on which all my phyla would be
monophyletic if just three branches (the position of none strongly supported) were moved, as discussed in responses to referee 3; that tree even
puts Acidobacteria within Proteobacteria (98% bootstrap support), being thus and in other ways much superior to single-gene trees (including
rRNA). Note that the early definition of 10 major eubacterial 'taxa' (actually clades, not taxa) based on 16S rRNA signature sequences [201] was
remarkably good and durable, better in some respects (e.g. treatment of what was a little later named Posibacteria [29] as a single phylum) than
later ideas based on trees [68], which can be misled by such artefacts; all 10 of those early-recognised major clades are represented as high-level
taxa in the present system, six as phyla and four as subphyla (within Proteobacteria and Sphingobacteria); the only phylum in this table not
foreshadowed by that rRNA signature analysis is Eurybacteria, which if they are indeed paraphyletic would not have exclusive rRNA signatures,
unless they were lost during the formation of Posibacteria.
Many, possibly all, of the so-called 16S rRNA 'deep' branches from thermophilic organisms (whether cultured, e.g. Thermotoga, Aquifex, Dictyoglomus,
Thermodesulfobacter, Coprothermobacter, or environmental) that have convergently acquired high GC likely to bias analyses are likely to be
phylogenetically misplaced members of one of these 10 phyla rather than genuinely distinct lineages [1, 46]. Bergey's Manual [202] and GenBank use
too many small 'phyla', not recognising Sphingobacteria or Planctobacteria even though both are robustly holophyletic on concatenated rRNA trees

preferable, organismally oriented, high-level bacterial classification that underlies the simpler system and phylum and subkingdom names used here,
and is comprehensive to the class level (but note that the classes suggested for Actinobacteria are probably unsound; they are better retained as a
single class [49], pending further research), and in which all names were validly published. *Probably paraphyletic taxa are marked with an asterisk.

5 Monophyly of Planctobacteria, repeatedly questioned since the relationship between Planctomyces and Chlamydia and the name were first proposed
[30], is now well supported by multiple protein trees [204] as well as by concatenated rRNA trees [18].
6 Unlike in [1] Endobacteria now excludes Selenobacteria and Thermotogales because they are now established as Negibacteria (see text). 'Low
GC-Gram positives' in most recent usages include the genetically related, but phenotypically non-Gram-positive, Selenobacteria and Mollicutes; by
embracing two major and phenotypically very different non Gram-positive classes it is now descriptively profoundly misleading in this sense; the
term 'low GC-Gram positives would be best restricted to Teichobacteria alone or else abandoned. The now frequently synonymous name
Firmicutes also is not used here, as it has become thoroughly ambiguous and is probably best forgotten; it was originally invented for Actinobacteria
plus Teichobacteria, but is now commonly contradictorily and inappropriately used instead for Teichobacteria, mycoplasmas and Selenobacteria
collectively, a probably paraphyletic and phenotypically most heterogeneous assemblage, just because these taxa usually form a single branch on 16S
rRNA trees. This usage destroys the whole point of the name, which was to contrast the thick-walled unimembranous Actinobacteria/
Teichobacteria with the wall-less unimembranous mycoplasmas (Molli- soft; Firmi- hard; cutes skin in Greek). Confusingly the older usage still occurs,
but often inappropriately modified to include Mollicutes. The now most prevalent misuse of Firmicutes comprises one group with one membrane
and no wall, one with two membranes and a thin wall, and only one of the two groups that have a single membrane and thick wall; probably this
group is not holophyletic, but a pseudoclade arising because actinobacteria are artifactually excluded from it because of their very high rRNA GC
composition and/or elevated evolutionary rate and because the dramatic quantum evolution and persisting higher evolutionary rate of neomuran
rRNA also artifactually drives them still further away [1]. Applying any name – even were it appropriate – to this artifactual pseudogroup is a
taxonomically meaningless prime example of how not to use the potentially very valuable information that 16S rRNA trees can provide; like all
other information, 16S RNA trees must by tested by their congruence (or incongruence in this case) with independent lines of evidence.
7A few early branching genera of 'high-GC Gram-positives' (e.g. Symbiobacterium [51]; Rubrobacterales [205]) are more like Endobacteria in some
respects, showing that the original distinction between Endobacteria and Actinobacteria has broken down (see discussion in text). The status of
such borderline organisms needs clarifying by a taxonomically broad and critical phylogenetic analysis of many conserved proteins and is potentially
very important for understanding the origins of actinobacteria and neomura.

bacteria, in eight phyla, grouped as Negibacteria in Table
1) and those with only a single surface membrane
(eukaryotes and two bacterial phyla: Posibacteria and

Archaebacteria); in other words one must decide whether
evolution occurred from Negibacteria to Unibacteria or
the reverse. Given the topology of the tree, if it can be

shown that Posibacteria evolved from Negibacteria, not
the reverse, then the root cannot lie between neomura and
eubacteria, as widely supposed, but must lie within negibacteria. Thus we can firmly establish the position of the
root of the tree by determining (a) its correct topology and
(b) the direction of major transitions within it. This paper
shows that several major transitions within eubacteria can
be unambiguously polarized and that no strongly polarized transitions conflict with each other. I show that all
the more robust polarizations are consistent with a negibacterial root but that several of them contradict alternative hypotheses: i.e. that the root is between neomura and
eubacteria [15,16], or between posibacteria and negibacteria, or within either neomura [13] or posibacteria. The
direction of some transitions is ambiguous, but enough
can be polarized sufficiently confidently to exclude all
phyla except Chlorobacteria from the root of the tree.
Of the five major transitions shown by green bars in Fig.
2, the prokaryote-eukaryote transition was analyzed in
considerable detail before [27,29], as were the eubacterial
to neomuran and the neomuran to archaebacterial transitions [1]. The first transition, from non-life to negibacteria, i.e. the origin of the first cell has also been considered
in detail [30,31]. Since those papers were published major
advances have been made in rooting the eukaryote tree of
life [3,4,28], which have important implications for the
universal tree. It is now generally accepted that all extant
anaerobic eukaryotes had ancestors with aerobic mitochondria [32] and highly probable that the root lies
between unikonts and bikonts [3,4,28]. Thus the last
common ancestor of eukaryotes was a sexual aerobe with
mitochondrion, and probably also a cilium and capacity
to make pseudopodia and dormant cysts. The fact that the
eukaryote cenancestor had mitochondria, which arose
from enslaved α-proteobacteria [33], means that eukaryotes must have evolved long after eubacteria, which must
have diversified to produce proteobacteria and α-proteobacteria before the first eukaryote. This raises a severe
problem for the common, but seldom critically evaluated,
assumption that the root lies between neomura and
eubacteria (red arrow Fig. 2); on that widespread assumption [15,16] eukaryotes would have originated in the very
first bifurcation on the neomuran side of the tree. Given
that hypothetical position of the root and the topology of
the tree, the basal eubacterial group would have been
posibacteria; negibacteria would probably not have
evolved by the time of the primary neomuran bifurcation,
whereas proteobacteria and α-proteobacteria would each
have arisen much later still. Such a later origin of α-proteobacteria than eukaryotes is now untenable. Bayesian
relaxed molecular clock analyses calibrated by multiple
palaeontological dates for 143 proteins [34,35] and for
18S rRNA [36] suggest that the eukaryote cenancestor was
only 0.9–1.1 Gy old, whereas the fossil record indicates

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

that eubacteria are at least 2.8 and probably about 3.5 Gy
old [1,37]. Thus there is now a very strong temporal and
evolutionary incompatibility between the now well-established chimaeric and aerobic nature of the oldest eukaryote and the widespread (and, I have argued, false [1])
assumption that neomura are as ancient as eubacteria.
There is no fossil evidence whatever that archaebacteria
are older than eubacteria – or even as old as them; given
the extensive phylogenetic evidence that archaebacteria
are sisters of eukaryotes, it is now very hard indeed to
escape the conclusion that neomura were derived from
eubacteria, not the reverse, and that the universal root lies
in eubacteria not between eubacteria and neomura.
Here I use transition analysis arguments that are entirely
independent of the fossil record to show that this is
indeed the case and that both the tree topology and the
root shown on Fig. 2 are correct. I provide the first detailed
analysis of the negibacteria to posibacteria transition,
which unambiguously polarizes it in that direction, and
argue that Posibacteria evolved from the new phylum
Eurybacteria, established here (Table 2). I give new evidence for the monophyly of Posibacteria, for the derived
nature of Actinobacteria compared with Endobacteria,
and a new argument from proteasome evolution that also
places the universal root within eubacteria and thus
excludes it from the eubacteria/neomura junction. I also
analyze 13 transitions within negibacteria (the eight
shown on Fig. 2 plus five less important ones within gracilicutes) in sufficient detail unambiguously to root the
tree, and map other characters onto the resulting tree.
Given this root, sequence trees, cladistic trees, the fossil
record, and polarizations deduced by transition analysis
are all congruent and thus mutually reinforcing. I also
argue that a root within negibacteria is ecologically plausible but any other position is not. One paragraph is first
necessary to summarize the conclusions form the previous polarization of the neomuran revolution [1].
The neomuran revolution
Morphological fossil evidence that eubacteria are several
times older than eukaryotes plus strong phylogenetic evidence that archaebacteria are holophyletic sisters of
eukaryotes (together comprising the clade neomura [29]),
not their paraphyletic ancestors, strongly indicate that
archaebacteria are much younger than eubacteria [1].
Transition analysis showed that 19 major changes in the
immediate common ancestor of neomura can all be
polarized in the direction from eubacteria to neomura,
most by strong selective arguments, none making sense in
reverse [1]. These numerous coevolving changes constitute the 'neomuran revolution', the second most important change in cell organization apart from the
immediately following origin of eukaryotes [1]. Most of
the 19 (now 20) neomuran innovations are explicable as

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

consequences of stronger cotranslational protein secretion associated with the replacement of murein cell walls
by cotranslationally-synthesized N-linked glycoproteins
(neomura means new walls), or of the simultaneous
replacement of eubacterial DNA gyrase by core histones
[1]. Both key innovations were arguably adaptations to
thermophily [1]. For want of space these very detailed
arguments are not repeated or even summarized here; nor
shall I repeat my detailed discussion of the fossil record
and the weakness of claims from it of an early origin for
neomura [1]. The best attempt since then to date the primary divergence of eukaryotes using sequence trees multiply calibrated by the fossil record [34,35] is consistent
with my argument that eukaryotes are well over a billion
years younger than eubacteria [1]. The recent discovery of
histone genes in crenarchaeotes [38] eliminates one line
of 'evidence' for claims that archaebacteria are ancestral to
eukaryotes rather than their sisters by supporting my contention that histones were already present in the last common ancestor of archaebacteria and of neomura [1]. This
considerably strengthens the thesis that the large differences in DNA-handling enzymes of neomura, compared
with eubacteria, were caused by rapid coevolutionary
adaptation to the origin of histones in the neomuran
cenancestor [1].

Methods
The main methods used were transition analysis and congruence testing as outlined above. BLAST and examination of resulting alignments and domain identifications
by CDD was frequently used to check homology among
potentially related sequences and to extend the literature
information about the distribution of key characters
across phyla. All BLAST results mentioned were by simple
P-BLAST, except for those for Omp85, which additionally
used PSI-BLAST in an unsuccessful attempt to detect more
divergent homologues in Chlorobacteria. In many cases I
used several phylogenetically divergent queries and also
reciprocal BLASTs of hits that were rather low; in some
cases reciprocal BLAST was dramatically better at picking
up strong relationships. BLAST hits with E values above 10
were considered to lack detectable homology.

teases, both of which are absent from Chlorobacteria.
Before explaining the logic, I provide a little background
information about controlled proteolysis within hollow
cylindrical macromolecular assemblies, which is essential
for all life. I have attempted to present the following discussion in sufficient detail for specialists to check and criticize the validity of all the major points, but have shorn
away as much detail as possible to expose the fundamental evolutionary points and to attempt to make the argument reasonably accessible to a broad audience. It is an
analysis and synthesis, not a comprehensive review.
Intra-cylinder ATP-dependent proteolysis (protein
digestion)
Three different families of ring-shaped or cylindrical macromolecular assemblies have evolved to allow controlled
ATP-dependent proteolysis in cells [39]. I shall argue that
two of them, ClpP protease and Lon protease [40] had
evolved prior to the bacterial cenancestor, whereas HslVU
[39] evolved only after the divergence of Chlorobacteria
and higher organisms. In all three cases the proteolytic site
is inside a hollow cylinder, in its central part as far away
from entry channels as possible, which maximally protects external proteins from digestion unless they are
actively pulled inside with the help of an associated ATPdependent chaperone that recognizes only the correct proteins for destruction. In the Lon protease the chaperone
and ATPase activities are part of a single large tripartite
multifunctional polypeptide chain that is capable of selfassembly. Its N-terminal region is important for this
assembly; its middle part has the ATPase/chaperone function; and its C-terminus has the protease activity. The protease and ATPase moieties each independently assemble
into hexameric rings and it is thought that they then form
a two-tiered hexamer with the digestive site on the inside.
By contrast, in ClpP and HslVU/proteasomes, the chaperones and proteases are distinct and much smaller
polypeptides coded by evolutionarily unrelated genes
(but are confusingly given similar names despite this).
Each assembles as a hollow ring and the whole assembly
is formed by an ATPase ring sticking to each end of the
protease ring/cylinder, in a suitable position to monitor
substrate entry.

Results and discussion
To orient the reader in the following complex discussion,
Fig. 3 indicates the 12 major transitions that will be discussed; five lesser transitions within Gracilicutes are also
considered, making 17 in all (13 within eubacteria). I
shall start with the evidence that actinobacteria are sisters
of or ancestral to neomura, then work systematically
down the tree to the root, discussing each transition in
turn, and finally discuss overall implications of this new
rooting. As Fig. 3 indicates, a major new line of evidence
for polarizing the upper part of the tree concerns stepwise
increases in complexity of the HslV and proteasomal pro-

Lon is present right across the living world but not found
in every species [40]; soluble LonA proteases are eubacterial or mitochondrial, whilst archaebacteria only have
membrane-bound ones (LonB) with an extra membranespanning domain inserted within the ATPase domain.
ClpP is present throughout eubacteria and in all chloroplasts, but not in any eukaryotes without plastids; this
suggests that it was lost prior to the origin of eukaryotes
but regained by photosynthetic eukaryotes when a cyanobacterium was enslaved to make chloroplasts. It is also
absent from all archaebacteria except Pyrobaculum and

Key molecular cladistic characters that help root the tree of life
Key molecular cladistic characters that help root the tree of life. Green bars mark major evolutionary innovations. Those
explained in detail in previous publications [1, 24, 26] are labelled in blue. Those introduced for the first time or discussed in
more detail in the present paper are in red. The three most fundamental changes in cell structure (the origin of unibacteria by
loss of the negibacterial outer membrane [1, 5]; the neomuran revolution involving novel chromatin and glycoprotein secretion
and much coadaptive macromolecular evolution [1, 5, 29, 62]; and the origin of the eukaryote cell [5, 27, 62]) are marked by
thicker bars. So also are the three major transitions, whose key importance and decisiveness for rooting the tree of life are
explained here for the first time: the origins of the proteasome, of flagella, and of Omp85 for insertion of OM β-barrel proteins. The three major kinds of cell from the viewpoint of their having fundamentally distinct membrane topology (eukaryotes,
unibacteria, negibacteria) [5, 29, 56, 62] are shown by thumbnail sketches (isoprenoid ether lipids in red, outer membranes in
blue). Thumbnail sketches also illustrate the inferred times of origin of two key cylindrical macromolecular assemblies (the OM
β-barrel protein Omp85 and HslVU/proteasome ATP-dependent regulated proteases) and the two-step increased complexity
of the latter. Negibacterial taxa are shown in black, Posibacteria in orange, and neomuran taxa in brown. Gracilicutes comprise
four negibacterial phyla with either a very thin peptidoglycan layer or no peptidoglycan at all in their cell envelope: Proteobacteria, Planctobacteria, Spirochaetae, Sphingobacteria (Table 1 explains the formal bacterial taxon names used here for precision
and brevity). Evidence for the relatively late dating of the neomuran revolution was explained in detail previously [1]. Note that
although Chlorobacteria and Endobacteria are shown as holophyletic, either or both might actually be paraphyletic; I suspect
that Endobacteria may be paraphyletic as the most divergent actinobacterium has endospores, but think that Chlorobacteria
are probably not. Conversely, it is uncertain whether actinobacteria are paraphyletic as shown or paraphyletic; see text – further work is needed to decide. For simplicity, five additional polarizations within Gracilicutes that are also discussed are not
shown; see the more comprehensive Fig. 7 for them and additional characters mapped onto the tree. Note that the ~2.8 Gy
date for the origin of cyanobacteria is based solely on hopanoid biomarkers; since no earlier organic deposits have been found
that are sufficiently well preserved and with enough extractable hydrocarbons for such biomarker analysis, this is a minimum
date (though its validity also depends on the assumption that such hydrocarbons have not migrated vertically in the rocks since
being formed, which is hard to test).

Methanosarcina; as the latter is known to have acquired
vast numbers of genes from eubacteria by lateral transfer
[41] it is probable that ClpP was lost in the neomuran not
the eukaryote ancestor (Fig. 3), and that both archaebacteria reacquired it by lateral transfer; proper phylogenetic
analysis is needed to test this.
ClpP protease is a ring with 7-fold symmetry [40],
whereas its unrelated chaperone ATPase ring (ClpX or A
[42]) has 6-fold symmetry, being made from six monomers. HslV protease has six subunits (Fig. 4), as does its
unrelated chaperone ring HslU, which allosterically activates it [43]. The proteolytic cylinder has 7-fold symmetry
and its unrelated ATPase chaperone 6-fold symmetry.
However, sequence analysis indicates a rather complex
pattern of relationships. Although ClpP, HslV, and proteasomal proteases are all very distantly related, ClpP serine
protease belongs to a different superfamily (acyl-CoA
decarboxylase/isomerase) from proteasome α- and β-subunits and HslV (threonine NTN hydrolases) [19] and cannot therefore be their ancestor. Thus the heptameric
proteasomal protease is much more closely related to the
hexameric HslV, not to the ClpP protease, which has a
fundamentally different tertiary protein-folding pattern.
The ClpX and HslU chaperones are closely related members of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily; thus they probably
either had a common ancestor or one evolved from the
other. The proteasomal chaperones are also AAA+ ATPases
but belong to a different family, being related to the
ATPase domain of the 3-domain membrane inserted protease FtsH of eubacteria and chloroplasts; in fact the
ATPase component of all ATP-dependent proteases
including Lon and FtsH are AAA+ ATPases that assemble
as hexamers, like other still more distant members of that
family.
Proteasomes are hollow cylindrical organelles for intracellular digestion of denatured proteins, found in neomura
and advanced actinobacteria (Actinomycetales) only.
They have a 15 nm long hollow cylindrical core, the 20S
proteasome, with internal proteolytic activity: additional
ATP-dependent chaperone structures at either end feed
denatured proteins into it for digestion. In all proteasomes the central core has 7-fold rotational symmetry and
four tiers of seven protein subunits (Fig. 4). In actinobacteria and archaebacteria the central core has only two
kinds of protein: two inner tiers of identical proteolytic βsubunits (threonine proteases) and outer ones of the evolutionarily related non-proteolytic α-subunits (Fig. 4).
This notable differentiation in function of the α- and βsubunits and associated change in their symmetry during
the evolution of the threonine NTN protein hydrolases is
the crux of my argument in the next section for polarizing
the direction of evolution. In eukaryotes the core is far
more complex, each protease subunit being different; this

the left of the main figure are cross sections through the proteolytic chamber showing respectively their 6-fold and 7-fold
symmetry. Evolution from the 12-mer HslV to the 28-mer
proteasome by duplication to form α- and β-subunits forming heptameric rings is shown by the arrow; loss of proteolytic activity by the new α-subunit (black) coupled with a new
ability to stack onto the β-subunits would have expanded the
digestive cavity radially and longitudinally and kept potentially
vulnerable external proteins further away from the proteolytic centres. Changed dimensions and shape of the α-subunit's ATPase binding surface probably favoured replacement
of the HslU ATPase ring by a different one. Hypothetical
evolution in the reverse direction by loss of the α-subunit's
would have created a less efficient purely β-subunit 14-mer
that might have lost any ability to bind an ATPase ring
through adapting to α-subunit binding instead and with a
broader digestive cavity and entry pore more likely to digest
the wrong proteins. It is unlikely that it could have survived
purifying selection long enough to reduce its symmetry to
sixfold and find a new ATPase partner to bind and thus generate HslVU. No selective advantage for simplification of a
proteasome to HslV is apparent. Subunit shapes simplified
from [199].

complication arose by repeated gene duplication during
the origin of eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, each end is capped
by a complex 'base' of several different proteins, including
6 different, but related, AAA+ ATPase chaperones, and a
multiprotein lid open at one side to allow denatured proteins entry [44]. Adding 'base' and lid created a functional
26S proteasome of 31–41 different proteins (Fig. 5) [45].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

Actinobacterial and archaebacterial proteasomes are
much simpler: ends are terminated by a ring of six identical, but directly related, chaperone AAA+ ATPase proteins,
so bacterial proteasomes are built of only three different
proteins of two evolutionary groups.

and lastly to the 26S proteasome; the two major transitions in proteasome structure important for polarizing the tree are
marked by grey bars. Blue bars mark four other important evolutionary transitions that also congruently polarize the tree.
HslV has 6-fold symmetry (a 2-tiered ring of 12 identical subunits) and arose from a monomeric NTN hydrolase, probably just
before Hadobacteria diverged. HslV rings interact with an unrelated chaperone ATPase, HslU, also having 6-fold ring symmetry, like ClpX chaperone from which it arguably evolved and virtually all AAA+ ATPase proteins, which originated in a burst of
gene duplications prior to the last common ancestor of all life [19]. The 4-tier proteolytic core of the 6-tiered 20S proteasome
evolved in a common ancestor of neomura and Actinomycetales (jointly proteates) of the subphylum Actinobacteria by
another gene duplication that generated its catalytic β- and non-catalytic α-subunits from HslV, with an associated symmetry
change to 7-fold: all four rings forming the core of the proteasomal cylinder have 7 subunits, but the 6-fold-symmetric HslU
was replaced by another hexameric ATPase ring from a different AAA+ family to make the proteasome 'base' (red in the twocolour sketch of the archaebacterial proteasome at the top left). Glycobacteria [1] comprise all the typical negibacteria with
OM lipopolysaccharide, i.e. all negibacterial phyla listed in Table 2 except Hadobacteria and Chlorobacteria).

HslV to proteasome differentiation polarizes the
evolutionary transition
I argue here that the proteasome 20S core particle evolved
from the simpler HslV, not the reverse. If this evolutionary
polarization is correct, it excludes the root of the universal
tree from a clade comprising neomura and actinomycete
actinobacteria (Fig. 5), the only organisms that have the
shared derived character of a proteasome with distinct but
evolutionarily related α- and β-subunits, only one of
which is enzymatically active. My argument does not
depend on the sometimes-controversial fossil evidence
[1] or on archaebacteria being holophyletic not paraphyletic [1]. My analysis, if correct, establishes the universal root within eubacteria, in agreement with paralogue
trees for metabolic enzymes [1], confirming that archaebacteria are highly derived, not a primary domain of life,
and that long-standing interpretations of early life assuming a molecular clock for rRNA have been grossly misleading [1,46].

As explained above, HslV is a single protein, evolutionarily related to both the α- and the β-subunits of the proteasomal digestive core. Twelve HslV molecules are arranged
as two tiers of six identical subunits. In its active form it
has an HslU ATPase ring at each end. Thus the 24-molecule HslVU protease is markedly simpler than, yet partially evolutionarily related to, the actinomycete/
archaebacterial proteasome. The simplest interpretation
of the evolutionary origin of proteasomes is that the core
proteasome originated from HslV protease by a gene
duplication that made functionally distinct α- and α-subunits arranged as a four-tier core rather than as a two-tier
core as in HslVU. This increased the length of the protective cylinder and the associated increase in the number of
subunits per ring to seven increased the diameter of its
hollow lumen, thus expanding the proteolytic chamber in
both directions. These concerted changes thus increased
the capacity of the proteasome to digest larger proteins
and to protect cytosolic proteins from accidental digestion
compared with the simpler and smaller HslVU.
I suggest that the increased diameter of the core caused
problems with its previous association with HslU, so that
this was replaced by a larger more distantly related AAA+
ATPase ring to form the cap attached to each end of the
20S proteasome. In archaebacteria the cap ring is a hexameric ATPase [47] that is related to the ATPase domain
only of FtsH protease; its homologue in actinomycetes is
a similar hexamer also of identical protein subunits, but
interaction with the 20S core has not yet been directly
demonstrated [48]. FtsH is very conserved and found in
all eubacteria, including actinobacteria where it coexists
with the putative cap ring; thus unlike HslVU it did not
disappear when proteasomes evolved by being directly
converted into the cap ring. Instead gene duplication and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

with one copy only losing its N-terminal membraneinsertion domain and C-terminal protease domains was
probably involved. However, neomura have partially
related proteins with two separate ATPase domains, which
in eukaryotes form a hexameric ATPase (Cdc48) responsible for chaperoning proteins out of the ER lumen for degradation. Cdc48 seems more closely related to the
proteasome cap, which in the ancestral eukaryote became
differentiated into a heteromeric structure by gene duplication and divergence, than it is to FtsH, which was probably lost in the ancestral neomuran. Since related two
domain ATPases are also found in a sprinkling of Posibacteria and even a few negibacteria higher in the tree (apparently not in Chlorobacteria), such proteins (rather than
FtsH) might have been ancestral to the proteasomal ring
protease; phylogenetic analysis of each domain is needed
to establish the precise evolutionary relationships among
them. The main point for this paper is that the ATPase regulatory cap of the proteasome originated from a different
AAA+ ATPase from HslU and its origin was a complex
process involving gene duplication, domain deletion, and
the origin of a novel ability to bind the newly arisen αsubunits of the 20S proteasome. It was not a simple process of molecular transformation with retention of all main
functions. Moreover, as for the proteasomal proteolytic
core, there was a further increase in regulatory ATPase
complexity, involving even more extensive gene duplication, to make the eukaryote 26S proteasome.
An important point is that the α- and β-subunits of the
proteasome appear to have diverged from HslV in opposite but mutually complementary directions. Four functions present simultaneously in HslV are partitioned
between them. The β-subunits retained the threonine proteolytic active centre at the N-terminus and the capacity to
assemble into a homomeric two-tier ring of 12 subunits.
But they lost the distally constricted inner rim that narrows the ends of HslV to prevent entry of unfolded proteins into the proteolytic cavity (Fig. 4) and the capacity to
bind to the regulatory ATPase ring. At the same time they
acquired a new ability to bind the β-subunit ring by the
same region of the molecule that lost the distal constriction. It is very likely that these two changes came about by
a concerted remodelling of this region of the polypeptide
chain. By contrast, the α-subunits lost the proteolytic centre and ability to form two-tier homomeric rings, but
retained the distal constriction and the ability to bind an
ATPase ring, albeit a different one as argued above. Thus
it was the opposite end of the molecule, away from the
ATPase-binding site, that was mainly modified in β-subunits.
It is well known that evolution can involve simplification
as well as stepwise increases in complexity. Therefore, the
fact that one can see functional advantages in the pro-

posed increase of complexity from smaller and simpler
HslV to larger and more complex 20S proteasomes,
though adaptively much more plausible than evolution in
the reverse direction, for which no selective advantage is
apparent, is not in itself proof that evolution occurred in
that direction. How can we rule out the alternative theoretical possibility of evolution in the reverse direction
from the 20S proteasome to HslV by simplification? The
clinching argument concerns the differentiation in function between the proteasome α- and β-subunits.
Though logically possible, direct reversal is mechanistically and evolutionarily highly unlikely. It would entail
the loss of the non-catalytic α-subunits that serve as a
toroidal adaptor for binding the two-tiered proteolytic βsubunit rings to the terminal ATPase rings. Such loss
would generate an intermediate two-tiered β-subunit 14mer without a narrowly constricted protein entry channel
or any ability to bind regulatory ATPase rings. Thus it
would be very harmful by digesting proteins that it should
not and would be strongly selected against. Three major
changes would be needed to convert such a defective βsubunit into HslV. The probability that it could simultaneously change its symmetry from 7-fold to six-fold,
evolve a narrow entry channel, and evolve an ability to
bind an ATPase ring in the short time before the mutant
strain was rapidly eliminated by such adverse selection is
negligible. Thus simple reversal would in practice be evolutionarily impossible. The fact that mutant Thermoplasmas without proteasomes can survive, unless subjected to
heat shock, does not contradict this argument. Nor does
the fact that proteasomes appear to have been lost by a
few actinomycetes that are endoparasites of animals. Simple loss of an entire structure has been observed repeatedly in evolution, but reversal of evolution of a complex
highly differentiated structure to form a more generalized
and simpler one closely mimicking an ancestral state has,
as far as I am aware never been clearly documented. Thus
evolution of HslVU from 20S proteasomes is so improbable that we can safely polarize the actual evolutionary
change in the opposite direction.
The transition from bacterial proteasomes to eukaryotic
26S proteasomes involved even more complex changes
and differentiation among the different subunits, so it
could not have occurred in the opposite direction either.
The actinobacterial/archaebacterial proteasome is
undoubtedly ancestral to the eukaryotic one, not the
reverse. The far greater complexity of 26S proteasomes is
associated with the origin of ubiquitin, unknown in bacteria but present in all eukaryotes as the most conserved
protein of all. Ubiquitin is covalently attached to proteins
to target them for destruction by 26S proteasomes; the lid
includes proteins helping to recognize the polyubiquitin
tags, remove them and push the target protein into the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

proteasomal digestive lumen. Clearly the extra complexity
of base and lid coevolved with the origin of ubiquitin tagging. The greater heterogeneity of the eukaryote proteasome core reflects the greater diversity of substrates that
need digesting compared with bacteria.
Arguing that HslVU evolved from proteasomes would
leave totally unanswered how 20S proteasomes evolved. If
HslV were not the ancestor of the α- and β-subunits, what
is? There are no other candidates. Polarizing the tree in the
direction shown in Figs 4, 5 explains the origin of proteasomes from HslV in a gradual way that is mechanistically
and evolutionarily plausible. Polarizing it in the opposite
direction totally fails to explain the origin of proteasomes
and postulates changes that are mechanistically and selectively unreasonable, and is thus doubly defective scientifically. Thus mechanistic, selective, and phylogenetic
arguments all unambiguously polarize the direction of
evolution from HslVU to the more complex 20S proteasome with larger digestive cavity and more strongly bound
ATPase caps, not the reverse. This important evolutionary
step took place prior to the last common ancestor of all
Actinomycetales, as proteasomes are found in all free-living actinomycete genomes so far sequenced, spread right
across the 16S rRNA tree [49] and are absent only in a few
parasites, almost certainly secondary losses such as are
widespread in parasites – perhaps allowed by their greater
degree of buffering from environmental heat shocks
inside animal bodies. It could have taken place at any
time between then and the origin of actinobacteria themselves, about twice as early, judging from 16S rRNA trees
[50]. The exact timing is uncertain as genomes of earlier
diverging actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium, Symbiobacterium
[51]) lack both proteasome and HslV genes. Presumably
one or other was present in their common ancestor shared
with Actinomycetales, and has been lost since they
diverged. Since, as discussed below, there have probably
been many losses of HslVU within eubacteria, but proteasome loss has never been clearly demonstrated among
free-living bacteria, losses of HslV seem more likely. If
proteasomes have never been lost from free-living bacteria, they evolved only in the immediate common ancestor
of Actinomycetales, and thus may be only half as old as
actinobacteria. If that is correct and proteasomes have
always been vertically inherited, neomura must be more
closely related to Actinomycetales (as several other characters such as cholesterol biosynthesis also suggested [1]),
making Actinobacteria paraphyletic. However, these parsimony arguments are not decisive evidence for actinobacterial paraphyly. We need more data on early diverging
actinobacteria; finding either HslV or proteasomes among
them would clarify this. The glycosyltransferases discussed below that support a posibacterial ancestry for
neomuran N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis are
found in Lactobacillales (Endobacteria) but not Actino-

mycetales; it is thus likely that characters relevant to
neomuran origins have been differentially lost in different
posibacterial lineages since the origin of neomura from a
posibacterium. The important point is that multiple lines
of evidence show that either actinomycetes or endobacteria are their nearest eubacterial relatives.

origin of archaebacterial proteasomes themselves totally
unexplained, and ignores the undoubted homology
between HslV and proteasomal subunits, and is thus
untenable for three independent reasons. Given this
homology, there had to be a transition between HslV and
proteasomes at some stage.

This argument polarizing the evolutionary direction from
HslV to the 20S actinomycete core proteasome, not the
reverse, uses paralogue rooting – but in a novel way not
suffering from the usual tree-reconstruction artifacts: it
stresses not sequence trees but two successive increases in
complexity of quaternary protein structure – from monomeric NTN hydrolases to hexameric HslV to 14-meric core
proteasomes with sharply differentiated functions and 3D
structures for the α- and β-subunits. This polarization provides strong evidence that actinomycetes and neomura
together form a clade, which I designate 'proteates'
because the proteasome with core 7-fold symmetry is its
synapomorphy, and thus excludes the root of the tree of
life from anywhere within proteates. One can hardly suppose that the complex proteasome core was the ancestral
state for all life and that monomeric NTN hydrolases ultimately evolved from it via HslV and two progressive simplifications involving a change of chaperone partner and
then its loss. Yet the 'standard model' of bacterial evolution assuming a root between archaebacteria and eubacteria must assume just that and specifically put it between
archaebacteria and actinomycetes (to explain their sharing proteasomes). Proteasome evolution excludes the root
from proteates (neomura plus actinomycetes) but does
not positively locate it. To do this we must polarise several
other evolutionary transitions (Fig. 3), as explained
below.

HslVU is found in Endobacteria (i.e. low-GC Gram-positives plus mycoplasmas, spiroplasmas: see Table 2) and
four phyla of Negibacteria [52,53]: proteobacteria, spirochaetes, Sphingobacteria, and many Eurybacteria (e.g.
Heliobacteria, Thermotoga, but absent from Fusobacteria,
which presumably lost it). HslVU is absent from the two
entirely non-flagellate bacterial phyla (Chlorobacteria,
Cyanobacteria) that are among the best candidates for
early diverging life. But this absence is not itself a strong
argument for considering them to be primitive, for it is
likely that HslVU can be lost evolutionarily. If, as Figs 3
and 5 suggest, HslVU evolved prior to the origin of Hadobacteria, it must have been lost by Cyanobacteria. Its
absence from Clostridiales and mycoplasmas suggests loss
within Endobacteria. HslVU is currently unknown in
Planctobacteria, which for reasons discussed below are
unlikely to be at the base of the tree, and thus may have
been lost by them. HslV is also absent from Hadobacteria
except for Thermus, but as its HslV has a highest BLAST hit
to Thermotoga and an HslU with highest hit to Aquifex, it
might have been a thermophilically adaptive lateral
acquisition from these unrelated hyperthermophiles. If
that were true, cyanobacteria and Deinococcus need not
have lost it, as HslV may have originated after Hadobacteria and Cyanobacteria arose, not just before Hadobacteria
as shown on Fig. 3.

The red herring of lateral gene transfer might be raised
against the above interpretation. Gille et al. [52] assumed
that proteasome genes were laterally transferred from
archaebacteria to the common ancestor of actinomycetes.
However, they presented no phylogenetic analysis to support this assumption; unpublished trees give no support
for lateral transfer, but as the α- and β-subunits and HslV
proteins are very divergent and with too long branches for
satisfactory phylogenetic analysis, such a possibility cannot be excluded with total confidence (J. Archibald pers.
comm.). However there is no positive reason to invoke
the total replacement of HslVU by three foreign genes;
possibly Gille et al. did so through being unaware of the
evidence of a vertical relationship between actinobacteria
and neomura and the likelihood that actinobacteria are
much older than archaebacteria [1], making the assumed
lateral transfer temporally impossible if it is assumed into
their cenancestor (though possibly more likely if it were
into the ancestor of Actinomycetales alone). Furthermore,
assuming lateral transfer from archaebacteria leaves the

Interestingly, trypanosomatid protozoa and Apicomplexa
retained proteobacterial HslVU in their mitochondria as
well as proteasomes in the cytosol and nucleus – the only
known organisms with both [52,53]. The fact that no bacteria are known to harbour both HslV and proteasomes is
consistent with HslV having evolved directly into proteasomes.
Given the position of the root of the tree deduced from
Omp85 evolution, as explained below, the earliest diverging phylum, Chlorobacteria, lacks HslVU. It is therefore
likely that they never possessed it and that it evolved in
the last common ancestor of all other bacteria, as shown
on Figs 3 and 5. The absence of HslVU from Chlorobacteria, though probably the primitive state consistent with
the rooting shown, is – I stress – not the primary reason for
that rooting, merely a very minor corroboration, given the
likelihood that HslVU was lost several times within negibacteria.

In sum, there were three successive increases in complexity: first from an ancestral monomer threonine protease to
hexameric HslV, thus increasing the proteolytic repertoire
of the common ancestor of eubacteria other than chlorobacteria; then to a 14-mer of two proteins in the actinomycete/archaebacterial 20S core proteasome with an
expanded digestive cavity and differentiated function of
its α- and β-subunits; thirdly to the markedly more internally differentiated eukaryotic 26S proteasome with
expanded proteolytic scope and selectivity. The two latter
compellingly polarize the tree of life from non-proteates
to proteates and from unibacteria to eukaryotes respectively (Figs 3, 5), and therefore place its root within or
among the other eubacterial groups.
Before explaining why the root must be within Negibacteria, I will briefly map onto the tree three main peptidases
that further digest the peptide products of the cylindrical
ATP-dependent proteases: tricorn peptidases [54], tetrahedral (TET) peptidases [55], and TPP proteases [55]. All are
multimeric with a central digestive cavity, but each with
unique structures dissimilar from the cylindrical enzymes
discussed above. Tricorn peptidases are the most phylogenetically widespread; they were probably present in the
prokaryote cenancestor but lost by the ancestral eukaryote
at the origin of the 26S proteasome. TET peptidases were
probably also lost then and occur only in prokaryotes,
mostly those apparently lacking tricorn – for which they
may substitute. The statement that TET is more widespread than tricorn [55] seems mistaken, but I agree that
tricorn is more ancient. As tricorn needs protein cofactors
but TET does not, TET could be acquired by lateral transfer
and substitute for tricorn more easily than the reverse;
phylogenetic analysis is needed to see if its scattered distribution arose thus, and not by differential loss. Tricorn
is a complex two-domain protein with both domains
present from Chloroflexus (Chlorobacteria) to archaebacteria. BLAST reveals an additional stand-alone paralogue of
the C-terminal proteolytic domain only in taxa ranging
from Cyanobacteria to Endobacteria; this appears to be
absent from Actinobacteria and archaebacteria and perhaps was lost when 20S proteasomes evolved. TPP peptidases are large proteins, like tricorn, but restricted to
eukaryotes. BLAST indicates that their proteolytic domain
is homologous to the much smaller subtilisin proteases of
endobacteria and some negibacteria; the stronger hits to
endobacteria fit the topology of Fig. 3; TPP could have
evolved from a smaller posibacterial protease by adding a
domain.
Membranome evolution: from negibacteria to
posibacteria
For understanding cell evolution we must consider not
only genomes but also evolution of the membranome:
the set of different genetic membranes that make the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

cohering supramolecular framework for cell structure
[56]. Bacteria fall into two very distinct subkingdoms with
respect to cell envelope structure: Negibacteria, all with a
double envelope with an outer membrane lying outside
the cytoplasmic membrane, and Unibacteria in which the
cytoplasmic membrane is typically the only membrane.
Proteins of the cytoplasmic membrane are always bundles
of α-helices and are inserted directly into it by the SecYE
translocon. In most negibacteria outer membrane proteins (Omps) are never α-helix bundles, but almost
always β-barrels, some of which form large hydrophilic
pores in it, e.g. porins; Omps are translocated across the
cytoplasmic membrane by SecYE and then insert specifically into the outer membrane. Of the 10 bacterial phyla
(Table 1) only two (Archaebacteria, Posibacteria) are Unibacteria: the rest, which include the majority of bacteria,
are all Negibacteria [1].
The most fundamental question about the origin of the
first cell [30] is did it have just one membrane, like most
Posibacteria, as usually assumed, or two surface membranes like all negibacteria (most bacteria) as Blobel [57]
and I [30,37] argued. The negibacterial double envelope is
so complex that it must have arisen only once. I previously
argued that the origin of the first cell is easier to understand in simple selectively advantageous stages if it was a
negibacterium with two membranes [31]; that obcell theory simultaneously explained the origin of the genetic
code, the first cell, and the negibacterial outer membrane.
That detailed transition analysis from precellular life to
the first cell will not be discussed again here, but the origin of the posibacterial cell wall can now be better understood than before because of advances in understanding
its biogenesis and also in the wall and membrane structure of the Selenobacteria (see Table 2), which I shall
argue are probably ancestral to all Posibacteria.
Fig. 6 contrasts cell envelope structure in posibacteria and
negibacteria. In Posibacteria, except for the almost
entirely parasitic Mollicutes (mycoplasmas and spiroplasmas, which lost murein walls) the murein peptidoglycan
layers are very thick and are attached to the cytoplasmic
membrane by covalently attached lipoproteins with their
lipid tails embedded in the outer leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer. In negibacteria the murein is usually much
thinner and attached instead to the outer membrane
(OM) by covalently attached murein lipoproteins with
their lipid tails embedded in the inner phospholipid leaflet of the OM lipid bilayer; unlike in mycoplasmas, lipoproteins are retained in negibacteria even when murein is
lost (most Planctobacteria). In Chlorobacteria and Hadobacteria the outer leaflet of the OM bilayer is also simple
phospholipid, but in all six other phyla it is lipopolysaccharide (within Spirochaetes a greatly modified version is
present in Leptospira [58], whereas the obligately parasitic

Figure 6
Contrasting cell envelope structure in posibacteria and negibacteria
Contrasting cell envelope structure in posibacteria and negibacteria. OM phospholipids, and when present possibly also
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may pass from their site of synthesis in the cytoplasmic membrane to the OM at the Bayer's patch
contact sites, but this is not proven and only one protein (Imp) needed for LPS export is yet known. During its biosynthesis
murein is secreted across the cytoplasmic membrane by isoprenol carriers. Lipoprotein (LP) is cotranslationally synthesised in
both groups. Conversion of a negibacterial wall to a posibacterial wall as shown would be very much simpler than the reverse,
requiring only a mutation causing sudden murein hypertrophy that could have broken the OM away from the Bayer's patches,
preventing further lipid transfer and OM regrowth, plus the origin of sortases with a novel recognition system for covalently
attaching murein lipoproteins (MLP) to the wall. As the negibacteria most closely related to Posibacteria (Eurybacteria) are glycobacteria with much more complex OM, secretion, and import mechanisms than Chlorobacteria (which lack lipopolysaccharide, most porins, Omp85, type I, II, and III secretion machinery, and probably the LolDE lipoprotein release mechanism, of
more advanced bacteria), evolution in the reverse direction of such a complex OM in one step from a posibacteria would be
practically impossible (see text) and immensely more difficult than the stepwise increase in its complexity possible with a chlorobacterial root of the tree. As the transitional stage between negibacteria and posibacteria had flagella, adding an outer membrane to a posibacterium and evolving a lipid export mechanism in one step would be even more complicated and improbable,
as flagellar biogenesis would have had to be conserved and modified at the same time (see Fig. 8). No satisfactory mechanistic
explanation has ever been given of how it could possibly have occurred.

spirochaetes have totally lost it; a few proteobacteria have
simplified it to lipooligosaccharide). Unlike the cytoplasmic membrane, the OM is pierced by hollow cylindrical βbarrel porin proteins that allow small molecules to diffuse
freely across it [59]. At intervals the OM is in direct and
strong adhesive contact with the inner membrane at
points known as Bayer's patches where there is a hole in
the thin murein wall. As OM proteins and lipids are all

synthesized by enzymes associated with the inner, cytoplasmic membrane, they have to be transported to the
OM secondarily, through the periplasm for proteins [59]
and probably via the Bayer's patches for lipids. Posibacteria entirely lack both the OM and this transport machinery. The OM and Bayer's patch structure can have evolved
only once in prokaryote history as its structural and biogenetic complexity is so great. Transition analysis asks

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

would it have been easier for a negibacterium to have lost
the OM (evolution from bottom to top in Fig. 6) and
make its wall thicker or for a posibacterium simultaneously to add an OM to a cell without them and simultaneously make the wall thinner and invent machinery for
export of both lipids and proteins to it and to make the
proteins that would make this complex system function
(evolution from top to bottom in Fig. 6)?
As negibacteria can evolve murein walls predominantly
much thicker than usual (e.g. Deinococcus), while still
retaining thinner Bayer's patch regions to allow the OM to
grow, I argued that if such a negibacterium mutated its
wall growth machinery so as suddenly to increase its
thickness still more dramatically it could overnight
become so thick as to break away the OM from its attachments to the cytoplasmic membrane at the Bayer's patches
[29,30]. Thereafter there would be no biophysical mechanism for newly made OM lipids to diffuse in a continuous
bilayer to regenerate the lost OM, so it was permanently
lost and could never reacquire an OM. Most OM proteins
would become useless and their genes inevitably degenerate and be deleted. The new unimembranous bacterium
was the first posibacterium – the ancestor of all Posibacteria and ultimately neomura also. Thus the initial step of
the transition from a negibacterium to a posibacterium
could have been very simple mechanistically; loss of the
outer membrane could have occurred by a single mutation causing murein hypertrophy. Murein lipoproteins
that originally linked the OM to the murein could be
retained for linking the thicker wall instead to the cytoplasmic membrane and modified as necessary; a key modification would be the longer retention of the signal
peptide to anchor them to the cytoplasmic membrane at
least until after they were cross-linked to the murein. As
discussed below, all posibacteria have related machinery
for achieving this, which establishes their monophyly. In
negibacteria the signal sequence must be cleaved after
protein secretion to allow the lipoprotein to move to and
diffuse within the OM bilayer (with the help of periplasmic chaperones [60]) prior to being cross-linked to
murein.
Evolution in the opposite direction from a posibacterium
would have required numerous mutations in at least dozens of genes to evolve a lipid, protein, and lipoprotein
export machinery; as the closest negibacterial relatives of
Endobacteria are Selenobacteria with the exceedingly
complex lipopolysaccharide, this would also have had to
evolve at that juncture! Of course, this machinery had to
have evolved sometime. The key question is: was it mechanistically easier to do so suddenly by the saltatory addition of an extra membrane to a unibacterial cell? Or is it
evolutionarily more understandable if it arose more gradually over many generations, and did so in three distinct

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

stages: (1) forming a simple outer membrane with no
lipopolysaccharide by differentiation between two preexisting membranes as in the obcell theory of the origin of
negibacteria to make the first Chlorobacteria [30,31], and
(2) later becoming more complex by adding the Omp85
mechanism for inserting OM β-barrel proteins in the common ancestor of Hadobacteria and all other life-forms
and (3) then evolving impermeable lipopolysaccharide
and associated complex secretion/import machinery in
the common ancestor of Cyanobacteria and all other lifeforms (Fig. 3)? I have long considered a transition from
posibacterium to negibacterium to be so difficult mechanistically as to be almost impossible in practice. Apparently only one person has ever tried to suggest how it
might have happened: Dawes [61] suggested that the OM
could have evolved from the forespore membrane that
encloses the spores of typical endospore forming Grampositives (Teichobacteria) prior to their germination.
However this has never seemed plausible to me, as the
engulfing forespore membrane could only have been
retained as an OM if Bayer's patches and their lipid export
machinery and porins all evolved in one cell generation;
failing that, such a hopeful monster would immediately
have lost the OM again. The problem is even greater than
that as the transitional intermediate between negibacteria
and posibacteria must have had flagella (Fig. 3). So flagella that originally supposedly evolved in posibacteria
would have had immediately to penetrate the saltatorily
formed OM, which they now do with the help of a lipoprotein L-ring (see discussion below on flagellar origins).
It is hard to accept that the negibacterial mechanisms for
both OM and flagellar biogenesis, including a key change
in the mechanism of lipoprotein secretion, evolved saltatorily in a single cell generation. Therefore I have long
rejected the widespread assumption that unibacteria are
ancestral to negibacteria [1,5,29-31,56,62,63]. None of
the thousands of implicit supporters of that majority view
has ever tried to explain how such an exceedingly improbable transition might have occurred. The onus is on them
to do so if they wish to continue to hold that view despite
the extensive contrary arguments. Can Dawes' theoretically possible speculation be converted into an evolutionarily acceptable theory? I strongly doubt it; to me it is no
more plausible than the other idea he discussed, that the
nuclear envelope also evolved from the forespore/spore
two membranes, which nobody accepts.
However one aspect of his theory does seem correct: this
is that the transition between negibacteria and posibacteria almost certainly occurred in an endospore-forming
bacterium. This is strongly indicated by the fact that Selenobacteria (phylum Eurybacteria: Tables 1, 2; Fig. 7) have
a fairly typical Gram-negative envelope with an outer
membrane and thin sacculus [64], yet have endospores
that are indistinguishable from those of Endobacteria [65-

The rooted tree of life emphasizing key novelties and synapomorphies. Thumbnail sketches show major variants in cell morphology (microtubular skeleton red; peptidoglycan wall brown; outer membrane blue). The most likely root position is as
shown; the possibility that it may lie within Chlorobacteria instead cannot yet be ruled out. Lowest level groups including or
consisting entirely of photosynthetic organisms are in green or purple. The frequently misplaced hyperthermophilic eubacteria
are in red; indel analysis confirms that Aquifex is a very divergent proteobacterium [79]. The new negibacterial infrakingdom
Gracilicutes segregates four phyla from the other negibacteria. Planctobacteria probably lost or reduced murein twice, as freeliving Verrucomicrobia have murein. Note that 12 synapomorphies support the earliest branching of Chlorobacteria. The fact
that mitochondria were present in the cenancestral eukaryote and that their ancestors, α-proteobacteria are a relatively
recently derived of the eubacterial phylum Proteobacteria, proves that eubacteria must be significantly older than eukaryotes
and decisively refutes suggestions that eubacteria may be derived from eukaryotes. As α-proteobacteria are nowhere near the
root of the tree (irrespective of whether it is rooted beside or within chlorobacteria or as some mistakenly think between
neomura and eubacteria) eukaryotes are substantially younger. The age of ~900 My for eukaryotes is based on a recent Bayesian analysis of 143 proteins multiply calibrated from the fossil record [35] and my own critical interpretation of the direct fossil record [129]. This tree, though constructed from rare discrete cladistic characters, is remarkably similar to a 31-protein,
191 species universal sequence tree published while this paper was being reviewed [175]; see responses to comments by referee 3 for discussion of the few differences, all but one (the position of Aquifex) in regions poorly supported on the sequence
tree.

67]. Furthermore they strongly group with and appear to
be paraphyletic to Endobacteria on rRNA and protein
trees. Thus there is little doubt that the endospore-forming negibacterial Selenobacteria are specifically related to
the posibacterial Endobacteria and probably also ancestral to them, in which case the transition did occur in the
direction from negibacteria to posibacteria, shown in Figs
2, 3, 5 and 7 and first argued in detail two decades ago
[29,30]. Woese, indeed, suggested this for Endobacteria
only [68], but neither he nor others have yet accepted that
it is true also for actinobacteria [29], as they do not branch
with Endobacteria on rRNA trees, though sometimes they
do so with Endobacteria plus Selenobacteria. The Selenobacteria/Endobacteria branch is generally called the 'lowGC Gram positives', but this is very misleading in cell biological terms as Selenobacteria have typical negibacterial
walls and negative or very weakly positive Gram-staining;
moreover not all members of this branch are low in GC).
The negibacterial envelope ultrastructure of Selenobacteria such as the heterotrophic Selenomonas, Sporomusa, and
the phototrophic Heliobacteria has been known for some
time, which led me to exclude them from Posibacteria and
to group them in the phylum Eurybacteria [69] with Fusobacterium, which also has a Gram-negative envelope, but
unlike the others lacks flagella. Later however, through
doubt whether their outer membranes were really related
to those of negibacteria, I more conservatively included
them and Thermotogales in Posibacteria [1]. Advances in
envelope chemistry of Selenomonas clearly show that it is a
genuine negibacterium, though with significant differences from other negibacteria, e.g. incorporation of cadaverine in its murein and absence of the Braun lipoprotein
[64]. Genomic evidence discussed below for Thermotoga
likewise indicates that its toga is a highly modified OM, so
I now exclude it also from Posibacteria. The fact that its
toga balloons away from the cell surface may be a consequence of its radically modified peptidoglycan [70] preventing murein lipoproteins from attaching it closely.
Thus the above evidence establishes the origin of Endobacteria from Selenobacteria, but what were the ancestors
of Actinobacteria? Are they sisters of or derived from
endobacteria, despite not grouping with them on many
sequence trees, or did they evolve independently from a
separate group of negibacteria? Clearly the proposed
mechanism of OM loss by murein hypertrophy is mechanistically sufficiently simple that it might in principle
have happened twice. However, as murein hypertrophy is
likely also to disrupt cell division, viability would probably need to be simultaneously maintained by independent mutations in the septation machinery. Thus, although
murein hypertrophy offers a biophysically very plausible
mechanism for OM loss, the generation thus of fully viable offspring could have been evolutionary very difficult
(though much less so than a hypothetical transition from

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

posibacterium to negibacterium) and thus relatively late
and unique in history. One major feature of the biogenesis of the similarly thick walls of actinobacteria and
endobacteria strongly favours a common origin. This is
the possession of a universal mechanism for covalent
anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of Posibacteria. This requires sortase enzymes, which are extracellular
transpeptidases positioned in the cytoplasmic membrane.
Surface protein precursors that enter the secretory pathway via N-terminal signal peptides have specific C-terminal sorting signals with an LPXTG motif or related
recognition sequences, which stimulate sortase-mediated
cleavage and the covalent attachment of their C-terminal
end to murein peptidoglycan cross-bridges. Genomes of
all Posibacteria encode multiple sortase genes, which have
diversified to use multiple different substrate classes with
different sorting signal motif sequences, and are involved
in anchoring a diverse array of structures, including pili on
the posibacterial surface [71]. Sortase diversity is greatest
in Endobacteria, which have four different sortase classes;
Actinobacteria have only two sortase classes, one shared
with Endobacteria [71]. The chlorobacterium Chloroflexus
has one protein with an N-terminal region homologous
with sortases, but there is no evidence that it acts as a sortase. A small subclade of proteobacteria has one sortaserelated enzyme, which does not fall into any of the five
posibacterial sortase paralogue classes, plus a few proteins
with a putative sortase recognition motif; it may be a very
divergent sortase, but biochemical evidence for such a role
is wanting [71]. Homologues of sortases are otherwise
entirely unknown from negibacteria despite scores of
complete genomes being now available.
Phylogenetic analysis is needed to see whether the isolated proteobacterial sortase-like proteins could have
been acquired by lateral transfer or are rare relics of a negibacterial ancestor of the posibacterial sortase family.
Present evidence suggests that a major diversification of
sortase enzymes, and possibly even the origin of the
whole sortase-based protein attachment mechanism, took
place in a common ancestor of Actinobacteria and Endobacteria at the time when murein thickening eliminated
the outer membrane. Sortase family 3 [71] is a clear
synapomorphy for Posibacteria. Overall the evidence is
consistent with the view that Actinobacteria are either sisters of or derived from Endobacteria and that their failure
to group together on most sequence trees is a phylogenetic
artefact.
Although I have argued above (and present even more
compelling arguments below based on flagellar evolution) that posibacteria evolved from negibacteria, it is
important to note that it is not quite so evolutionarily difficult as I once thought [29,30] to add some kind of extra
outer lipid membrane to a basically unimembranous cell.

This is shown both by the case of the archaebacterium
Ignicoccus discussed in a later section and by the presence
in mycobacteria and corynebacteria (which form a related
subgroup of actinobacteria) of a unique outer lipid layer.
Although its structure is less well known than is the much
simpler OM of negibacteria, it is clear that this
'mycomembrane' is chemically and structurally utterly
different from the negibacterial OM and has evolved independently [72]. The lipids are not phospholipids but
mycolates or corynomycolates [73,74] and the lipid layers
are thicker. Polysaccharides are abundant outside it as are
lipopolysaccharides, but these are chemically unrelated to
and should not be confused with those of negibacteria.
The major cell wall carbohydrates are arabinogalactans
[73], as in plants. Although the protein channels that
allow nutrient uptake through this thick impermeable
layer are misleadingly called porins they are unrelated to
the porins of Negibacteria in sequence or structure [75].
The most abundant mycobacterial porin MspA has a
much longer cylindrical pore than negibacterial porins
and no clear protein relatives in any other group [76,77].
Far from weakening the contrast between negibacteria and
posibacteria, the existence of the non-homologous
mycomembrane, which clearly evolved in response to the
same selective pressures for impermeability as the negibacterial lipolysaccharide (during the origin of glycobacteria – see Fig 5 legend – as discussed in detail in a later
section) shows that such selective pressures do not necessarily produce a membrane with the specific properties of
the glycobacterial/negibacterial OM. Thus the fact that all
negibacteria except Chlorobacteria have a common mechanism for targeting their OM β-barrel proteins (discussed
in detail later), which is not found in these actinobacteria
or Ignicoccus is very strong evidence for their monophyly.
What the existence of the mycomembrane does mean,
however, is that arguments for the ancestral character of
the negibacterial envelope must rest on the new polarizations within the tree discussed in this paper, not on the
original argument based on the difficulty of adding a second membrane [29,30]. Thus it is not the number of
membranes per se that is important but their structure
and biogenetic mechanisms; this allows us easily to distinguish homology (within negibacteria) and analogous
convergence (Ignicoccus and mycobacteria/corynebacteria). Despite such superficially similar convergence the
distinction between negibacteria and posibacteria
remains fundamental.
Monophyly of Posibacteria
The monophyly of Posibacteria plus Eurybacteria is
weakly shown by some 16S rRNA and protein trees, but is
often absent from single or multigene protein trees (but
seldom more than weakly or moderately contradicted);
commonly it is broken by a usually weak association of
Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria, which seems devoid of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

biological rationale but may reflect base-compositional
similarities. The failure of posibacteria to form a clade on
multigene trees might be taken as evidence that they each
independently lost the outer membrane, but the shared
sortase mechanism for covalently attaching lipoproteins
to their thick murein walls discussed above renders this
highly improbable. It seems more likely that Actinobacteria are excluded from the Endobacteria/Eurybacteria (usually misleadingly called the low GC Gram-positives) by
their exceptionally high GC content. Perhaps also a systematically elevated rate of molecular evolution may draw
them towards their true relatives, the neomura, which
have very long branches on trees for all molecules drastically modified during the neomuran revolution [1]. I see
no other way of reconciling the compelling evidence from
cell wall and proteasome evolution with most sequence
trees. If Endobacteria and Actinobacteria diverged almost
immediately after the origin of posibacteria, such biases
would probably overwhelm any historical signal for their
relationship, a phenomenon known in eukaryotes [2,46]
– if the bias is sufficiently strong, this artefact could even
happen if Endobacteria are paraphyletic ancestors of
actinobacteria, which might therefore be substantially
younger than many sequence trees suggest; the contradictory branching order among the three glidobacterial
phyla, Endobacteria/Eurybacteria, and Actinobacteria
seen in different single and multigene trees is another reason for not taking any of them too seriously. Exoflagella
without an L-ring [78] for binding the OM are a synapomorphy for Posibacteria, as are their single envelope
membrane of acyl ester lipids and the sortase machinery.
Substantial shared deletions in chaperones Hsp90 and
Hsp70 of all Posibacteria compared with all negibacteria
except Eurybacteria, e.g. Fusobacterium and Thermotoga
[79] suggest that Endobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Eurybacteria are all related (Fig. 8) and that sequence trees that
group either Endobacteria or Actinobacteria with cyanobacteria or eobacteria that lack these deletions are artifactual. Actinobacteria and Endobacteria are also the only
bacteria with resistant resting spores, except for myxobacteria; sporulation and spore germination programmes are
so complex that spores probably evolved once only in
their common ancestor [1]. These developmental programmes of endobacteria and actinobacteria should be
compared in detail to check that they are synapomorphic
for Posibacteria. That actinobacterial spores are exospores
and less resistant than endobacterial endospores does not
preclude a direct relationship; in fungi basidiomycete
exospores and ascomycete endospores ultimately had a
common origin. If posibacterial endospores and
exospores are related, endospores must be the ancestral
state, as the unique mode of origin of the endospore by a
forespore cell engulfing its sister evolved prior to the
divergence of the eurybacterial Selenobacteria and Endo-

pore complex and the of the type different basal body
Schematic comparison of the three different basal body structures of eubacterial flagella with the putative ancestral junctional
pore complex and the related type III secretion injector. The exoflagella of Proteobacteria and Planctobacteria (Exoflagellata),
Sphingobacteria, and Eurybacteria project through the outer membrane, with which they are associated by a lipoprotein L-ring
(made of FlgH protein units). Spirochaetes have endoflagella within the periplasmic space that do not penetrate the outer
membrane and thus need no L-ring. Exoflagella and spirochaete endoflagella both have a P-ring (made of FlgI protein units)
thought to act as a bushing for free rotation within the thin peptidoglycan wall (sacculus). Both P-ring and L-ring are absent
from the exoflagella of Posibacteria (Actinobacteria and Endobacteria). Posibacterial flagella would automatically have become
external when the ancestral outer membrane was lost. The more complex multiprotein shaft of spirochaetes, clearly a derived
character (see text) is shown by its greater thickness. If junctional pore complexes also use a basal type III secretion apparatus,
flagella and type III injectors probably evolved from them independently. If junctional pore complexes lack type III secretion
homologues, it is likely that they evolved during the origin of flagella only and that type III injectors evolved later in the ancestral exoflagellate by simplification of flagella (dashed arrow); see text for discussion. The diagram assumes that ExbB/TonB/
OmpA only associated with the basal body of the flagella and evolved into the flagellar stator MotAB during the origin of flagella.

bacteria, and on sequence trees Endobacteria nest within
Selenobacteria. This developmental mechanism by forespore engulfment is so complex that it is unlikely to have
arisen convergently. As endospore formation existed prior
to the loss of the OM and origin of the sortase machinery
by the ancestral posibacterium, actinobacterial exospores
must either have been derived from endobacterial
endospores or, less likely, evolved independently.
The recent demonstration that the most early diverging
actinobacterium, the filamentous Symbiobacterium, has
endospores and highest BLAST hits to Endobacteria for
nearly half its conserved proteins [51] has now demolished the classical distinction between Endobacteria and
Actinobacteria [1,49]. Symbiobacterium is a high-GC
Gram-positive with posibacterial envelope structure [50].
Unless its strong grouping with Actinobacteria on 16S
rRNA trees [50] which showed Posibacteria as holophyletic, but with weak sampling of outgroups rather than
low-GC Gram-positives, is a base composition artefact, it
indicates that Actinobacteria evolved their high-GC
genomes before losing endospores and thus confirms that
they evolved from ancestors with the endobacterial phenotype. If we use presence of endospores and highest
BLAST hits to the most proteins to demarcate between the
two posibacterial subphyla, they would be Endobacteria.
If we used their high-GC genomes, grouping on 16S rRNA
trees, and filamentous phenotype, they would be Actinobacteria. Thus the classical distinction between Endobacteria and Actinobacteria has now become entirely
arbitrary and any justification there might once have been
for placing them in separate phyla is now totally gone.
Unfortunately they lack both HslVU and proteasomes, so
we cannot use them as a demarcation criterion. Perhaps
the presence of phosphatidylinositol in Actinobacteria
but not Endobacteria may provide the best distinction
and synapomorphy for Actinobacteria.
One previously suggested synapomorphy for Posibacteria
is unsound. Three-amino-acid insertions in SecF [79] have
entirely different sequences in Actinobacteria and Endobacteria and are not even universal in Endobacteria; as
similarly unrelated insertions occur at precisely the same
location in a few scattered negibacteria, there have been
multiple unrelated insertions at that site.
Although I have argued that Posibacteria are monophyletic (having a single origin), they cannot also be holophyletic (i.e. additionally including all their
descendants), because neomura evolved from them; thus
Posibacteria are paraphyletic, but none-the-worse for that
as a taxon: they are an excellent taxon, but not a clade –
taxa must not be polyphyletic but can permissibly be
either paraphyletic or holophyletic: see [69] for a discussion of these important distinctions. Much more study is

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

needed of early diverging actinobacteria to establish the
sequence of evolutionary events, not only to provide better criteria for classification of Actinobacteria (a recent
attempt to subdivide them into classes was premature and
probably not phylogenetically sound [1]), but also to
determine the precise position on the tree at which
neomura evolved from them; four characters of those that
pointed to an actinobacterial ancestry for neomura [1] are
so far known only in Actinomycetales (proteasomes, chitin, cholesterol biosynthesis, H1-histone-like basic proteins), making it likely that neomura evolved after the
early actinobacterial divergences and are sisters of or
derived from Actinomycetales only. A fifth typically
eukaryotic character, the calcium-binding regulator calmodulin, has clear relatives not only in actinobacteria as
earlier thought [1], but also in cyanobacteria and even a
few proteobacteria; as there are no convincingly strong
BLAST hits in archaebacteria and the rare α-proteobacterial sequences are much more divergent than the actinobacterial or cyanobacterial ones, calmodulin probably
entered eukaryotes vertically from actinobacteria [1] or by
lateral gene-transfer from cyanobacterial prey in the transitional prekaryote.
Fusobacteria as relatives of Posibacteria: key evolutionary
importance of Eurybacteria
Fusobacteria are especially significant for understanding
the negibacteria-to-posibacteria transition as they are
morphologically clearly negibacteria with an OM with
Omp85, but more of their genes appear related to posibacteria (mostly to Endobacteria), than to other negibacteria (mostly to Gracilicutes, especially Proteobacteria)
[80]. The simplest interpretation of this superficially puzzling contrast is that Fusobacterium is close to the boundary between posibacteria and negibacteria and to the
origin of Gracilicutes, but cladistically closer to Posibacteria (Fig. 7). Such sisterhood is supported by synapomorphic indels in Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones [81]. There
are two simple explanations of their unusual contrasting
pattern of BLAST hits for different genes. First, variation in
degree of divergence of different gene lineages after the
unibacterial/gracilicute split, secondly the loss of a large
number of negibacteria-associated genes when the ancestral posibacterium evolved from a negibacterial ancestor
after the posibacterial and fusobacterial lineages diverged;
Mira et al. identified 28 such clusters of genes [80]. Rejecting OM loss solely because it implies strong conservation
of OM-related genes after the gracilicute-fusobacterial
split [80] is invalid; many are very strongly conserved.
One need not invoke lateral gene transfer on nearly such
a large scale as recently suggested [80]. In particular, it is
biophysically highly implausible that its ancestor originally had one membrane and acquired an OM by such
transfer [80]. Postulating lateral transfer of 28 clusters of

Page 24 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

genes with OM-related function is also dramatically less
likely than any documented case of lateral transfer.
Grouping Fusobacteria instead with Gracilicutes because
of similar insertions in RNA polymerase [82] was also
unsound. One 'insertion', in the β'-subunit, is not really
an insertion but an internal triplication of a pre-existing
SBHM domain. Tandem multiplication of a pre-existing
domain is mutationally much simpler and more likely to
be convergent than insertions at one site. At the same
position the typically single SBHM was thus multiplied to
an octomer in the ancestral cyanobacterium, clearly independently [82]. The tree for the β'-subunit strongly
excludes Fusobacterium from Gracilicutes [82], thus clearly
supporting convergent duplication, not shared ancestry
for this triplication. The second 'synapomorphy' is a
BBM2 insertion in the β-subunit, but even the authors
[82] propose four independent BBM2 insertions into that
half of the molecule (three closely clustered) and two others into the β'-subunit. Thermotoga alone has four such
insertions, two unique and one at the same position as the
supposed Fusobacterium/gracilicute synapomorphy. The βsubunit tree strongly excludes Thermotoga from the gracilicute branch, but not Fusobacterium [76]. They accepted
the independent insertion of BBN2 at the very same site in
Thermotoga, but not for Fusobacterium; however, according
to my present interpretation (Fig. 7), Thermotoga and Fusobacterium are mutually related and might even be sisters; if
so, only one such insertion occurred in their common
ancestor. The precise position of Fusobacterium on the βsubunit RNA polymerase tree [82] may therefore be a treeconstruction error. The α-subunit RNA polymerase tree
strongly excludes Fusobacterium from Gracilicutes [82].
Grouping them together as Group I [82] was unjustified,
as was the suggestion of lateral gene transfer. Notably,
Fusobacterium does not share the long gracilicute insertion
in the D/σ70 subunit [82]. Genome sequences of other
genera of Fusobacteria are needed to confirm that they are
cladistically closer to Posibacteria than to Gracilicutes.
Because of their unique combination of characters Fusobacteria cannot be placed in Posibacteria, as sometimes
suggested [79] or in Gracilicutes. I previously grouped
Fusobacteria with Selenobacteria as the negibacterial phylum Eurybacteria [69]. I now modify Eurybacteria by adding Thermotogales, which now must be excluded from
Posibacteria because the discovery of flagellar L-ring and
P-ring proteins and OmpA-related OM proteins unambiguously establishes their negibacterial envelope character.
Fibrobacter however, originally also included, as early
rRNA trees failed to establish its affinity with any other
negibacterial phylum, is now transferred to Sphingobacteria based on strong protein indel evidence [83] and
weaker confirming evidence from the latest 16S rRNA tree
http://rdp.cme.msu.edu. Thus Eurybacteria now comprise

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

three distinct groups, ranked here as classes: the phenotypically conservative Selenobacteria and Fusobacteria
and the phenotypically aberrant Togobacteria. Selenobacteria comprise the always endospore-forming photosynthetic Heliobacteria, the endospore-forming free-living
heterotrophs like Sporomusa and gut endobionts like
Selenomonas. The Heliobacterium genome project now
under way should reveal whether its flagella also have Pand L-rings, as expected, and provide a host of genes that
ought to stabilise sequence trees and further test the proposed relationship between these three classes. The evolutionary importance of the negibacteria-posibacteria
transition is so great that we need extensive genomic and
deeper cell biological studies of a much greater diversity of
Selenobacteria, which offer the key to understanding this
major quantum evolutionary step: the most important of
all in bacterial evolution other than the still more dramatic neomuran transition and the origin of the negibacterial cell itself.
Coevolution of flagella and cell envelope structure
The hollow eubacterial and solid archaebacterial flagella
are unrelated [84,85] and evolved separately. Eubacterial
flagella are a synapomorphy for Posibacteria, Eurybacteria
and Gracilicutes; their great complexity depends on about
50 different proteins (including regulatory ones; for
review see [86]) and was a reason for excluding the root
from all three groups [1]. But it was not a decisive one, for
flagella have been repeatedly lost within them all and
therefore, in principle, one or more of the three glidobacterial phyla that never have them might also have lost
them. Here I introduce new evolutionary arguments that
polarize the direction of evolution from negibacteria to
posibacteria much more decisively than previously and
which stem from the fact that posibacterial, Thermotoga,
and gracilicute flagella are undoubtedly homologous and
that the transition between Negibacteria and Posibacteria
must therefore have involved an intermediate stage that
possessed flagella. I propose a new explanation of flagellar
origin: that flagella first evolved in the common ancestor
of eurybacteria and Gracilicutes by combining in a novel
way two pre-existing macromolecular complexes of the
glidobacterial cell envelope.

As Fig. 8 makes clear, there are three fundamentally different structural relationships between flagella and the cell
envelope in eubacteria, and three correspondingly different basal body structures. The flagella of Posibacteria are
structurally simpler than those of the gracilicutes (spirochaetes, sphingobacteria (Salinibacter only) proteobacteria, planctobacteria) and Thermotoga, because they lack the
P-ring that acts as a bushing for allowing free rotation
within the thin peptidoglycan layer (the sacculus) that
characterises all gracilicutes, except those Planctobacteria
that have secondarily lost it. Unlike in Posibacteria, flag-

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

ella of Exoflagellata (Proteobacteria plus Planctobacteria),
Salinibacter, and Thermotoga have an L-ring [78], formed
by FlgH lipoprotein, which embeds them neatly into the
OM in a manner allowing free rotation.
I shall argue that the ancestral condition was as in exoflagellate, Salinibacter, and eurybacterial flagella with both an
L-ring and a P-ring. The L-ring was lost when the flagellar
shaft was secondarily internalised to the outer periplasm
by the spirochaete cenancestor. The cenancestral posibacterium lost the L-ring when it completely lost the OM in
which it is embedded and lost the P-ring when the thin
murein sacculus with which it interacts was drastically
thickened. This polarisation of flagellar diversification is
entirely consistent with the negibacteria-posibacteria transition in envelope structure discussed above. The evolutionary origin of the flagellum itself provides an
independent powerful argument for the root being in negibacteria. Fig. 8 illustrates the new explanation for the origin of flagella. Eubacterial flagella have two
fundamentally distinct parts with different evolutionary
relationships that had to come together to make the first
functional proton-driven rotary flagellum. The first is the
basal body – the rotor, which is definitely related to the
type III secretion injection apparatus of Exoflagellata [87],
and as I propose here for the first time, possibly also to the
slime-secretion nozzle of cyanobacteria used for one of
the two major forms of gliding motility. The second is the
proton conductor stator that provides the rotary force,
which is clearly related to the TonB/ExbB complex that in
many negibacteria couples cytoplasmic membrane protein motive force to import across the OM. I suggest that
the first flagellum originated by the novel combination of
a slime-secretion nozzle and a modified TonB complex
that became coupled to it, thus causing it to rotate. Later
the tip of the nozzle evolved into the hook and shaft of the
flagellum. As both components that combined to make
the flagellum are separately present only in Negibacteria,
flagella must first have evolved in negibacteria. Thus both
the posibacterial flagella and their thick walls must be secondarily derived. This argument therefore decisively
excludes the root from Posibacteria.
Evolutionary relationship of eubacterial flagella and type
III secretion injectors
Flagellins that constitute the main flagellar shaft and hook
components are secreted not by the signal mechanism,
universal for life – having arisen prior to the cenancestor
[30,31,88], but by transport of leaderless proteins through
a hollow tube to the growing tip [78]. This flagellar protein secretion system is made of eight proteins at the base
of the hollow basal body, which are conserved among all
three types of eubacterial flagella and were clearly present
in their common ancestor. Seven of these are also conserved in the type III secretion system used by parasitic

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

members of Exoflagellata to inject proteins into host
eukaryotic cells [86]. The single protein not thus shared
(FliO) might be optional as it appears not to be present in
the lateral flagella of Chromobacterium violaceum and Vibrio
parahaemolyticus (but is present in their polar flagella) or
in Aquifex aeolicus; its apparent absence from these lateral
flagella must be secondary, suggesting that it was also secondarily lost by Aquifex (such loss is not a necessary consequence of hyperthermophily as it is present in
Thermotoga). FliH also appears to have been lost by
Aquifex, Caulobacter and some lateral flagella [86]. There
are also structural and sequence similarities between flagellins and the type III injection tube subunits. Overall the
type III secretion system is clearly related to eubacterial
flagella but markedly simpler (~20 proteins [87]), partly
because it does not need so many regulatory proteins and
lacks the stator of the motor that drives rotation (MotAB
in proton-driven flagella; PomAB in sodium-ion-driven
flagella). A complex rotating pentameric HAP2 cap prevents flagellar subunit loss to the exterior during tip
assembly [78]; the type III system must avoid wasteful loss
of subunits to the environment more simply.
The greater simplicity of the type III system stimulated the
suggestion that it might be ancestral to flagella; as the system is also present in a few free-living bacteria it could be
more ancient than eukaryotes, against which the best
studied examples are all directed, so that suggestion is not
totally implausible. If flagella did evolve from type III
secretion injectors, it would place the root of the whole
tree of life within Exoflagellata, as only they are known to
possess it. An alternative possibility is that flagella are the
older state and that the type III system evolved from them,
which would conversely place the root outside Exoflagellata, prior to their divergence. As flagella and type III injectors each has unique proteins not shared by the other, it is
much more parsimonious to suggest that neither is
directly ancestral to the other, but that each evolved independently from a simpler common ancestor with a different function from both and that each added different
novel proteins to the ancestral core in the process of
adapting it to new functions [87]. What this ancestral
structure is has not yet been established by sequence or
structural evidence. The most likely candidate in my view
is the nozzles that secrete carbohydrate fibrils onto the
substrate to mediate gliding motility in Cyanobacteria
[89] and in the myxobacterial Proteobacteria. The idea
that gliding motility may have preceded flagellar motility
is not new, but the following explanation of how one
form of gliding motility could have evolved into flagella
is.
Gliding motility and the origin of eubacterial flagella
Gliding motility occurs in Chlorobacteria, Cyanobacteria,
Eurybacteria, Sphingobacteria, and myxobacterial Proteo-

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

bacteria, but not in Unibacteria; probably at least three
different secretory mechanisms are involved [78]. Some
cyanobacteria glide by secreting slime by junctional pore
complexes [89], whereas others glide by extension, adhesion and retraction of type IV pili related to those responsible for twitching motility in Proteobacteria [90].
Myxobacteria also have two forms of gliding; social gliding depends on type IV pili at the front of the cell and
adventurous gliding uses slime secretion through OM
pores at the rear [90,91]. Gliding in much faster in Flavobacteria and other Sphingobacteria than in Proteobacteria; it depends on an ABC transporter in the cytoplasmic
membrane and on outer membrane lipoproteins; the proteins involved seem unrelated to those responsible for
gliding in myxobacteria or to flagella [92]. Sphingobacterial gliding is probably unique to the phylum and a
derived state: I argue in a later section, when discussing
lipopolysaccharide evolution, that its origin was associated with changes in cell envelope lipid composition and
the loss by most of them of flagella, widespread characteristics of the phylum – it used to be thought that flagella
are always absent from Sphingobacteria [1], but they are
present in the newly described halophile Salinibacter [93],
which supports other reasons given later for thinking that
Sphingobacteria were ancestrally flagellate, like all Gracilicutes. The molecular nature of the slime secretion
machinery is unknown in Cyanobacteria and Myxobacteria, but they both have hollow cylindrical junctional pore
complexes embedded in the cell envelope from which the
slime is actively extruded like toothpaste from a tube
[89,91]. In cross section the extrusion nozzles look very
similar, but only the cyanobacterial ones have been seen
in lateral view. Remarkably they appear to consist of four
stacked hollow rings [89], just as does the basal body/rod
region of eubacterial flagella. I consider it improbable that
two such stacked ring structures evolved entirely independently and therefore propose that such a structure was
present in the common ancestor of Cyanobacteria and
Myxobacteria, and that flagella evolved directly from it to
generate the immediate common ancestor of Gracilicutes
and Eurybacteria. Later in the common ancestor of Exoflagellata the junctional pore complex evolved independently into Type III secretion injectors. This assumes that a
primitive form of type III secretion machinery will be discovered in association with junctional pore complexes; if
it is not, then I would argue that the injectors evolved
instead from flagella by simplification. All the genes
shared by flagella must have undergone gene duplication
prior to that common ancestor, as it initially must have
retained both systems (to explain the presence of both in
Proteobacteria, assuming no secondary acquisition of
pore complexes by lateral gene transfer).
If this is correct, it would establish that flagella evolved in
negibacteria not posibacteria, and therefore that the root

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

of the tree is also within negibacteria. Two further arguments make this conclusion inescapable. These concern
the origin of the flagellar motor.
Negibacterial origin of eubacterial flagellar motors
Flagellar rotation can be driven by protons or sodium
ions. The proton- and sodium-driven motors are separate
and can coexist in the same cell. Both probably evolved
early in flagellar evolution as posibacteria and Gracilicutes
have both types. Both have two components: an ion channel (MotA or PomA respectively) in the cytoplasmic membrane, which associates with ancillary proteins and the
outside of the bacterial rotor so as to drive it; and a protein
that binds to the ion channel and attaches it rigidly to the
murein cell wall to prevent it from rotating (MotB or
PomB [86]). I now argue that these components of the
motor evolved from functionally and structurally similar
proteins of the TonB complex, which is found exclusively
in Negibacteria (never Unibacteria). It is absent from the
two negibacterial phyla here argued to be the most primitive (Hadobacteria and Chlorobacteria), but would have
been present in the putatively non-flagellate common
ancestor of Cyanobacteria and Gracilicutes/Eurybacteria.
Loss of the TonB complex during the origin of Posibacteria by OM loss is to be expected as its function is to transmit energy from the cytoplasmic membrane ion channel
(the ExbBD complex) to OM β-barrel proteins involved in
ligand import or signal transduction (so called Ton-Bdependent receptors [59]); clearly with the receptors gone
TonB was useless and quickly lost also. TonB spans the
periplasmic space, just like MotB, and like MotB binds a
proton channel in the cytoplasmic membrane proximally,
binds to the murein wall within the periplasmic space,
and to OM proteins distally. Thus it is functionally the
same as MotB but not obviously related in sequence.

Mot A is clearly homologous in sequence to ExbB [86] and
I suggest evolved from a gene duplicate of it during the
negibacterial origin of flagella. The proximal proton channel binding domain of MotB has no obvious relatives, but
I suggest that it evolved from the corresponding domain
of TonB and diverged so substantially during the remodelling necessary to attach the complex to the basal body
that this derivation is no longer reflected in its sequence;
3D structure might be more similar. The distal domain of
MotB is very different from TonB, but is related to OmpA,
a widespread negibacterial OM protein. I suggest that
MotB first evolved by gene fusion between duplicates of
the TonB and OmpA genes. This would have differentiated its OM attachment properties from those of TonB
and prevented it from interfering with the latter's specific
binding functions to OM importers/transducers. As Posibacteria lack an OM (as discussed above the outer lipid
layer of Mycobacteria is unrelated) or freestanding OmpA
paralogues, they could not have provided such a domain

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

to the ancestral MotB. Thus neither of the ancestors of the
flagellar motor proteins (TonB complex, OmpA) was
present in Unibacteria, so the proton-driven stator of
eubacterial flagella must first have evolved in a negibacterium. If ancestors of both the stator and, as argued above,
the basal body rotor (i.e. slime-secretion nozzles) were
present only in negibacteria, clearly they must have come
together in negibacteria. This proves independently of the
powerful cell wall arguments discussed above that negibacteria were ancestral to posibacteria, not the reverse.
Merely modifying the TonB complex in the manner just
described would be sufficient to make it interact with the
basal ring of a pre-existing secretion nozzle and to cause it
to rotate. Assuming that the cell remained only locally
attached to the substratum by the slime this would cause
the whole cell to rotate as seen today in bacteria tethered
by their flagella. Such whole-cell rotation rather than
swimming is likely to have been the original function of
flagella as it would not require any complicated controls
such as reversibility or directionality of swimming or
chemotaxis, phototaxis or gravity or magnetic reception to
become immediately useful. Merely rotating would stir
the boundary layer close to surfaces and make nutrient
uptake more efficient, providing an immediate selective
advantage for evolving the flagellum even prior to the evolution of the flagellin shaft. Thus simply coupling a preexisting proton channel, already fixed to the murein by
TonB and able to transmit a shearing force to the outside
of the rotor would in one evolutionary step generate a
functionally beneficial protoflagellum; such coupling
could in principle have occurred by modifying just one
protein associated with the ExbBD complex.
Evolution and diversification of the flagellar hook and
shaft
Swimming could then simply evolve by multiple gene
duplications and divergences to generate all the flagellar
rod/hook proteins and the helical flagellin shaft. The rod
that attaches the hook to the basal body is made of four
mutually paralogous proteins (FlgB, FlgC, FlgF, FlgG
[86]). The hook is made of FlgE and the first hook-filament junction protein is FlgK, both related to the rod proteins, showing that all six arose by successive gene
duplications of a single common ancestral gene. An unrelated gene FliK regulates hook length; as its sequence is
related to that of YscP, the similarly functioning molecular ruler for the injection tube of type III injectors [86], it
is likely that precursors of the rod/hook proteins and a
common system of length regulation were already present
in the common ancestor of both – here argued to be a
slime-secretion nozzle. The second hook-filament junction protein (FlgL) is related to the shaft (filament) protein flagellin (FilC) [80] and probably gave rise to it by
gene duplication. Spirochaete flagella are more complex

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

than others in having three flagellins (typically only one
flagellin in the rest; Caulobacter is a notable exception with
several) surrounded by a fourth sheath protein [94], and
two or four FliG homologues not one [86]; FliG is one of
the three proteins making the C-ring at the base of the
basal body – the others are FliM/N, necessary for rotation
and the flagellar switch [86].
This much greater complexity of spirochaete basal bodies
and shafts is a synapomorphy for spirochaetes, which
means that their endoflagella must be derived rather than
ancestral; thus the ancestral negibacterium cannot have
been a spirochaete. Typical spirochaetes such as
Treponema lack a lipoprotein L-ring, which was obviously
lost when they evolved endoflagella that unlike ancestral
flagella no longer penetrate the OM. Curiously, unlike
them, the early diverging Leptospira retains the L-ring protein FlgH [80]; irrespective of whether this means that it
also still retains an L-ring unlike other spirochaetes,
despite periplasmic internalization, or instead that this
protein has become detached and acquired a new function in the OM or elsewhere, this provides further good
evidence that spirochaetes evolved secondarily from
ancestors with exoflagella and L-rings, and proves that Lrings can be lost as postulated for the ancestor of Posibacteria.
That Planctomycetes have secondarily lost peptidoglycan
and replaced it by a protein exoskeleton is now clearly
shown by the discovery of relict enzymes for murein peptidoglycan synthesis [95], thus confirming the theory that
the ancestral eubacterium already had a murein peptidoglycan wall [30]. The planctomycete genome sequence [95]
also revealed the presence of P-ring genes even despite the
loss of the peptidoglycan sacculus. As Planctomycetales
probably lost peptidoglycan hundreds of millions, possibly billions of years ago, this suggests that loss of the Pring is evolutionarily very difficult, unless either the Lring, or the entire flagellum is also lost as in most Sphingobacteria. Biogenesis of the more distal part of the flagellum, including the L-ring, has apparently become
developmentally dependent on the P-ring proteins; mutations in FlgI protein are highly disruptive, and when that
protein is eliminated the L-ring protein (FlgH) is destabilised and cells are immotile. Blocking lipoprotein synthesis inhibits flagellar assembly at a much earlier stage than
L-ring assembly, indicating that lipoproteins are fundamentally important for proteobacterial flagellar biogenesis.
Sphingobacteria ancestrally had flagella
That all Sphingobacteria evolved from ancestors that once
had flagella is suggested by the presence throughout nonflagellate members of the phylum of a protein related to
MotB with a C-terminal OmpA domain, but faster evolv-

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

ing that MotB, as shown by my BLAST study, but mutually
more closely related than to proteins in other phyla. MotA
homologues could not be detected in non-flagellate
Sphingobacteria (but are present in Salinibacter, which
exceptionally for sphingobacteria has flagella [93], as are
the usual flagellar proteins expected for negibacterial exoflagella, such as L- and P-ring proteins and at least two
proteins that though annotated only as OmpA family/
domain proteins could be MotB or MotB relatives [96];
affinity of Salinibacter flagellar proteins with those of δand ε-proteobacteria is expected from the phylogeny of
Fig. 7, so was insufficient reason for suggesting lateral
transfer [96]). The MotB homologue is longer in
Cytophaga, having an extra N-terminal domain (a tetratricopeptide repeat). In other genera it is usually similar in
length to MotB, but in a few flavobacteria an Smc/transforming-acidic-coiled-coil domain, not generally found in
MotB, is present within the N-terminal half of the molecule. This diverse pattern of evolution in putative MotB
relatives of non-flagellate Sphingobacteria, coupled with
the absence of MotA, suggests that they may have evolved
from MotB and were recruited for new functions conserved within non-flagellate Sphingobacteria, immediately on the loss of MotA, thus preventing the total loss of
MotB. Sequence phylogenies of the proteins might clarify
this further.
Contrasting origins and biogenesis of eubacterial and
archaebacterial flagella
I now suggest that the highly probable historical fact that
eubacteria evolved in cells with two envelope membranes
may help explain some of the differences from archaebacterial flagella, which certainly evolved in cells with only
one membrane.

The complex biogenesis shared by flagella and type III
secretion [78], would itself probably have been harder to
evolve in a unimembranous cell than in a negibacterium
with its two bounding membranes. Even the putative precursor of both must have been quite complex and must
have evolved a mechanism to prevent loss to the environment of its tip-growing subunits exported to the end
through the central hole. I suggest that tip-capping
machinery first evolved in its ancestor when an even simpler precursor may have been used to secrete proteins or
polysaccharides into the inner periplasm. Later by evolving a specific murein hydrolase, as used by developing
flagella to penetrate the sacculus, these could be secreted
into the outer periplasm instead. Later still, by evolving a
lipoprotein ancestor of the L-ring protein FlgH, the tip of
the nozzle could penetrate the OM and secrete slime to
the exterior. Thus even the evolution of the relatively complex putative precursor of flagella can be explained in simple mechanistically feasible and individually selectively
advantageous steps. Thus, as I asserted previously, there is

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

no irreducible complexity in eubacterial flagella [97]: the
most complex macromolecular machine of all in bacteria
– creationists, who use it as a spurious argument against
evolution [98], take note!
The very much simpler archaebacterial flagella evolved in
a unimembranous cell from a type IV secretion mechanism related to eubacterial pili, involving the signal mechanism but a specialised signal peptidase; significantly
their flagella are solid and probably assemble at the base,
like pili [78], avoiding the leakage problems for initiating
type III secretion in Unibacteria. The actinobacterium that
evolved into neomura either lacked flagella or they failed
to survive replacement of murein by glycoprotein and/or
the origin of archaebacterial lipids, or were simply depolymerised by the hot acid environment of the cenancestral
archaebacterium [1]. This basal growth by solid flagella
may be an essential feature of initial flagellar evolution in
a unimembranous cell, as the early stages of evolution of
a tip-growing hollow flagellum prior to the necessarily
later origin of a cap could have been strongly disfavoured
by loss of proteins to the exterior; in a cell with two membranes the initial stages of evolution of the hollow flagellum and cap could have been in the periplasmic space
where secreted proteins could accumulate without being
totally lost. If so, the hollow eubacterial flagella perhaps
could initially only have evolved in a negibacterium with
two membranes.
The traditional assumption that cells first had one membrane predated discovery of the OM and its universality in
eight of the ten bacterial phyla; given a root outside proteates, that model must assume the origin of posibacterial
exoflagella without L- or P-ring prior to the last common
ancestor of life and overcome the difficulties emphasized
above of adding them simultaneously with the origin of
the OM and its secretion mechanisms in any hypothetical
transition to exoflagella. It would also fail to have any precursors such as TonB or a slime-secretion nozzle for the
evolution of flagella. It must also assume that spores had
evolved prior to the cenancestor, but were not retained by
the other nine bacterial phyla (unless the probably convergent spores of Myxobacteria were such 'relics'). The first
three assumptions are mechanistically implausible and all
four selectively implausible. Thus a negibacterial origin of
eubacterial flagella and the derivation of posibacteria
from negibacteria are very hard to evade.
Hyperthermophilic eubacteria are derived and not
mutually related
Having both L-ring and a P-ring and a peptidoglycan sacculus without cadaverine [80], and an OM without sulfonolipids,
provides
a
combined
structural
synapomorphy for Proteobacteria (initially established
solely from rRNA trees; now also supported by insertions

in inorganic pyrophosphatase [9] and RNA polymerase
[82]). Proteobacteria, including Aquifex – which has flagella, can be unambiguously defined phylogenetically as a
clade that ancestrally possessed an outer membrane with
lipopolysaccharide but not sulphonolipids, a thin periplasmic murein wall with diaminopimelic acid but no
cadaverine, and exoflagella with L-ring and P-ring; only
flagella are sometimes secondarily missing. My BLAST
analysis of Aquifex P-ring and L-ring proteins shows the
highest hits with deltabacteria, and lower ones with epsilobacteria, consistent with its classification within Thiobacteria [1]. Thus flagellar evolutionary considerations
clearly support the inclusion of both Aquificales and Geobacteria, which have the same envelope structure, in a
broadened Proteobacteria [1], which now for the first
time has a structural rationale for its circumscription and
clear distinction from all other gracilicute phyla.

tions from Thermotoga (discussed below) makes it
unlikely that it is really related to Aquifex or other Proteobacteria. Instead the shared presence of glycerol-1-P dehydrogenase with Posibacteria and their grouping together
on that gene tree, plus a shared deletion suggest, albeit not
decisively, a specific relationship with Posibacteria. As
Thermotoga is thus probably related to but not actually a
posibacterium I place it in the paraphyletic phylum Eurybacteria, from which posibacteria evolved. Overall, it is
very likely that the deep branching of both Thermotogales
and Aquificales and their grouping together on many
sequence trees are both artefacts of convergent hyperthermophilic biases. My placement of each in a derived position
in
two
independent
ancestrally
nonhyperthermophilic phyla is congruent with other evidence that the ancestral eubacterium was probably not
hyperthermophilic [104].

It has been much debated whether Thermotoga is a posibacterium or a negibacterium [1] and whether its thin
toga is related to the negibacterial outer membrane or not.
Originally I placed it in its own subphylum independently
of both Negibacteria and Posibacteria [5], but influenced
by indel arguments [81,99], the absence of lipopolysaccharide, and the initial lack of clear evidence for porins or
phospholipids in the toga, and its very different morphology from the negibacterial OM, assumed that it had
evolved independently and therefore placed Thermotogales in Posibacteria [1,69]. But flagellar evidence now
makes this untenable, as does the fact that its major OM
protein is a porin related to OmpA of advanced negibacteria. The fact that the Thermotoga genome [100] encodes
both P-ring and L-ring proteins clearly shows that the toga
is related to the outer membrane of gracilicutes, and
implies that lipolysaccharide has been lost. The complexity of flagellar structure and biogenesis and its coadaptation to two distinct membranes is so great that it could
neither be convergent between Thermotoga and Gracilicutes nor acquired by lateral gene transfer. Lateral transfer
has given Thermotoga many foreign genes [101,102], but
these are for soluble enzymes that are useful individually
and not a part of a giant macromolecular complex integrated into two distinct membranes. My BLAST analysis of
the very conservative L-ring and P-ring proteins of Thermotoga shows the highest hits with deltabacteria (and then γproteobacteria), but not with Aquifex. The grouping of
Thermotoga and Aquifex on some genomic trees may be
partially attributable to lateral transfer between them and
thermophilic archaebacteria [103]. However, as such
grouping is also seen when putatively laterally acquired
genes are excluded [22], it probably reflects either strong
thermophilic biases and convergence of amino acid composition caused by the exceptionally high GC content of
both taxa [1,2] or a genuine relationship between the two
genera. The absence of 4–5 characteristic gracilicute inser-

The argument so far
Let me summarize: proteasome evolution excludes the
root from the proteate clade; cell envelope evolution and
flagella evolution independently of each other exclude it
from Posibacteria; eubacterial flagellar evolution also
excludes it from Gracilicutes and Eurybacteria, and places
it among the non-flagellate eubacteria that have gliding
motility by slime secretion from junctional pore complexes (i.e. Glidobacteria). Later sections will present two
further transition analyses that narrow down the position
of the root still further within the Glidobacteria. The
Omp85 argument is especially strong and excludes it from
all negibacteria except Chlorobacteria. I shall also give further evidence that Gracilicutes are derived compared with
Glidobacteria. All these polarisations of the tree are congruent. Combining them leaves only two possible places
for the root: within Chlorobacteria or between them and
all other organisms. Thus Chlorobacteria are either the
ancestors of or the sisters of all other organisms, and the
last common ancestor of all cells was bounded by two
membranes not one. We can conclude that the OM was
probably simply made of phospholipids, as in Chlorobacteria, and that murein and lipoprotein were both present,
whereas lipopolysaccharide was probably absent.

The OM would have been attached to a peptidoglycan
wall of intermediate thickness by murein lipoproteins.
Cotranslationally secreted lipoproteins are found in all
eubacteria (with the sole and unsurprising exception of
Mollicutes, which evolved by losing murein from a teichobacterial ancestor that had already lost the OM) and
their special signal peptidase II was clearly present in the
last common ancestor of all life. It was lost during the
neomuran revolution during the overhaul of the signal
recognition particle during the origin of cotranslationally
secreted N-linked glycoproteins when the murein wall
was lost. There is a pleasing simplicity in the distribution

Page 30 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

of cotranslationally secreted conjugated proteins across
the tree of life. The basal domain eubacteria makes only
cotranslationally secreted lipoproteins and has separate
signal peptidases for lipoproteins and unconjugated proteins. The derived clade neomura makes only cotranslationally secreted glycoproteins and uses the same signal
peptidase for them as for unconjugated proteins. The
neomuran revolution was the largest quantum evolutionary change in cotranslational secretion in the history of
life and unsurprisingly therefore caused dramatically
rapid and unprecedented changes in the translation apparatus itself, i.e. in ribosomal RNA and proteins [1,5,29].
Using the false assumption of a molecular clock, these
major transient changes have often been misinterpreted as
evidence for an early divergence of neomura and eubacteria. The name neomura (new walls) is entirely appropriate
given the six separate polarisations that independently
and congruently show that their walls evolved after the
peptidoglycan walls of eubacteria: the prokaryote to
eukaryote, eubacterial to neomuran, non-proteate to proteate, negibacterial to posibacterial, eobacterial to gracilicute/eurybacterial and chlorobacterial to Omp85containing negibacteria. That six independent robust
polarisations (plus a seventh strong but somewhat less
decisive one, also discussed below: the origin of glycobacteria) are all congruent with each other and with the fossil
record [1] shows that eobacteria are immensely older than
archaebacteria. Thus there is only one primary domain of
life: the paraphyletic eubacteria. Eukaryotes and archaebacteria are far younger and holophyletic sisters, secondarily derived from within one eubacterial phylum, the
substantially older Posibacteria. Before discussing the
polarisations within Glidobacteria more needs to be said
about Unibacteria.
Unibacteria: links between posibacteria and
archaebacteria
The subkingdom Unibacteria comprises all bacteria
bounded by a single membrane only (i.e. Posibacteria and
Archaebacteria), whereas Negibacteria include all eight
phyla with an additional outer membrane – the vast
majority of bacteria. It has long been clear that Unibacteria are paraphyletic, as eukaryotes (also bounded by a single membrane) evolved from them. Unibacteria and
eukaryotes are the only organisms with a unimembranous
cell envelope. The arguments detailed above establish
clearly for the first time that the unimembranous state is
derived, whereas the bimembranous state of negibacteria
is the ancestral state for all life, as first suggested by Blobel
[57] from considerations of the evolution of cotranslational protein targeting to membranes. Thus the textbook
picture of the first cells having but a single membrane is
probably wrong. Far from making it more difficult to
understand the origin of life, this probably makes it easier
[30,31].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

It was also clear that Negibacteria are technically paraphyletic long before they were proposed as ancestors of
Posibacteria, as mitochondria and chloroplasts both
evolved from negibacteria and both retained the OM
throughout their enslavement by eukaryote host cells
[105,106], even after the whole genome was lost by the
hydrogenosome and mitosome descendants of mitochondria [106]. Thus the OM is exceedingly stable in evolution
and has only very rarely been lost [29] – just once, making
the distinction between Unibacteria [69] with a single
bounding membrane and Negibacteria [29] much more
important than is usually realised. Conversely the gulf
between archaebacteria and eubacteria, although also very
important [1], is of less fundamental significance than
widely supposed. Most of the special features of archaebacteria that initially led to their separation from eubacteria are major, but often largely quantitative changes in the
evolution of a specific subset of their molecules: in DNAhandling enzymes and those related to ribosomes, and
not major qualitative cellular innovations. I have argued
that these marked and concerted changes stem from only
two more fundamental key neomuran innovations; chromatin and co-translational synthesis of surface N-linked
glycoproteins [1]. They are puzzling only to those who
mistakenly believe in a universal molecular clock and
ignore the key importance for cell evolution of quantum
evolution (transiently hyperaccelerated change) and intermolecular coevolution. Only three major innovations of
substantial biological significance, not shared with
eukaryotes, distinguish archaebacteria from posibacteria;
novel flagella, discussed above; reverse DNA gyrase, a
derived enzyme that evolved by fusion of two ancestrally
eubacterial enzymes [1]; and novel isoprenoid ether lipids, all three arguably adaptations to hyperthermophily
and acidophily [1]. The difference in lipids from eubacteria has sometimes been fundamentally misinterpreted as
evidence for the early origin of archaebacteria, or even the
independent origin of neomuran and eubacterial cells
according to one extreme view [107,108], which is
entirely untenable as it ignores most cell biology [18] and
the evidence from proteasomes and a dozen other characters for a relationship between archaebacteria and actinobacteria [1]. The contrast between the eubacterial murein/
lipoproteins and neomuran glycoproteins also should not
be misinterpreted as evidence for independent origins or
even for early divergence between the two. As I pointed
out long ago [29] there is an important similarity in biogenetic mechanism that implies some kind of genetic continuity between them. In both cases the oligosaccharide/
glycan precursors are assembled while being covalently
attached to a polyprenol phosphate carrier in the membrane to which N-acetylglucosamine is the first residue to
be attached (always in eukaryotes, usually in archaebacteria). Sequence similarity is detectable by BLAST between
the transferase that catalyzes this step in eubacteria and

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

homologues in crenarchaeotes. Furthermore even though
the carriers are the much longer dolichol in neomura
(undecaprenol or decaprenol in eubacteria) the enzymes
that make them are highly conserved in both archaebacteria and neomura [109,110], thus confirming the conjecture of some conservation of surface glycan biogenesis
across the eubacterial/neomuran divide [29].
An unavoidable conclusion from the holophyly of proteates demonstrated by proteasome evolution is that isoprenoid-ether membrane lipids replaced acyl-ester lipids
during their origin, in agreement with my previous polarization of the transition from actinobacteria to archaebacteria via the neomuran revolution [1,30]. Even during this
dramatic change Archaebacteria retained machinery for
making and degrading fatty acids [18] and numerous
archaebacterial genomes encode proteins homologous to
phospholipid synthetases; eubacteria and archaebacteria
both make isoprenoids. The idea of an unbridgeable gulf
in lipid biosynthesis between them is a myth. What was
novel in the first archaebacterium was joining isoprenol
to glycerol phosphate with new stereochemistry (to snglycerol-1-phosphate, not sn-glycerol-3-phosphate like
acyl-ester lipids). All major groups of Posibacteria, plus
Thermotoga, but no other negibacteria or eukaryotes, have
close relatives of the enzyme making this unusual stereoisomer [18]; this glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase is a
previously unrecognized synapomorphy for Posibacteria
plus some Eurybacteria: invocation of lateral transfer in its
history [18] is unjustified. Its presence in both Actinobacteria and Endobacteria is consistent with posibacterial
monophyly and provides a modest argument for excluding the root from Posibacteria plus Eurybacteria. I suggest
it originated where shown in Figs 3 and 7 by gene duplication from one of three universally distributed sisters
[18]; those paralogue subtrees put the root in eubacteria,
one between cyanobacteria and the rest, one between
Planctobacteria and the rest, and one within Proteobacteria; never between archaebacteria and eubacteria [18], further exemplifying the conflicts stressed above among such
trees.
Previously I pointed out that the presence of phosphatidylinositol in all eukaryotes and all actinobacteria, but no
other eubacteria was evidence for a specific relationship
between actinobacteria and neomura [1], as were 13 other
characters in addition to proteasomes (one of these, calmodulin, is now excluded from the list as it has been
found in some other eubacteria). I assumed that the
ancestral archaebacterium had lost phosphatidylinositol
when it evolved isoprenoid ethers. In fact some archaebacteria have isoprenoid ether analogues of phosphatidylinositol [111]; as their CDP-inositol transferases are
homologous to those of eukaryotes, it is likely that they
also were inherited from actinobacterial ancestors and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

retained during the changeover from acyl ester glycerophospholipids to isoprenoid ether glycerophospholipids
in the ancestral archaebacterium: further evidence of evolutionary continuity in membrane lipid synthesis between
eubacteria and archaebacteria. The inositol phospholipids
of the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca (δ-proteobacterium) are dialkyl ether lipids [112] and thus not homologous with the acyl ester phosphatidylinositol of
eukaryotes and actinobacteria, so do not weaken acyl ester
phosphatidylinositol as a sound synapomorphy for actinobacteria plus neomura (given that it was inevitably lost
with other acyl esters when the ancestral archaebacterium
lost that biosynthetic machinery [1]).
However, another character that was previously used to
group Posibacteria with neomura turns out to be less decisive than originally thought: the signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [1]. Negibacteria have a short hairpinshaped 4.5S SRP-RNA with only one GTPase protein that
binds to universally conserved helix 8 at the hairpin head,
essential for co-translational protein secretion. This is
probably the ancestral state for all life, and the more complex neomuran double-headed 7S SRP-RNA, with an extra
adjacent helix 19 having its own binding protein, is
derived, originating later in the neomuran revolution [1].
Bacillus subtilis and other Bacillales (Endobacteria) lack
helix 19, but have an extra 5' domain resembling the positionally corresponding Alu domain of neomuran 7S SRPRNA. SRP-RNA specialists regard these domains as
homologous [113]; if true it would be a synapomorphy
for Posibacteria plus neomura and Thermotoga [1]. However, as this extra domain is absent from some Endobacteria (Lactobacillales) and all Actinobacteria [113], either
the 3-loop structures are convergent, not homologues
(extreme Alu-domain variability in neomura makes
homology debatable), or this domain was secondarily lost
by Lactobacillales and Actinobacteria (or neomura
evolved not from actinobacteria but from endobacteria,
which proteasomes and numerous other characters disprove [1]). The presence of an Alu-like domain indistinguishable from that in Bacillales in Thermotoga SRP-RNA
[113] suggests that this domain may have evolved in the
common ancestor of Posibacteria and Thermotoga. I stress
that although the evidence presented here and previously
[1,28] that Actinobacteria and neomura together are a
clade is strong, we lack firm evidence that Actinobacteria
are paraphyletic ancestors of neomura, as previously
assumed [1] and suggested above, and not simply their
holophyletic sisters. If extant Actinobacteria were actually
holophyletic, only a single loss of the Alu domain in their
common ancestor would be necessary on the assumption
that this domain evolved in the ancestor of Eurybacteria
and Posibacteria. Without stronger evidence for homology between the variable neomuran structures and the
more uniform ones of Bacillales/Thermotoga, it is unclear

Page 32 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

whether or not it can be used to argue that Eurybacteria,
Posibacteria and neomura together constitute a clade. It
would be valuable to seek this domain in SRPs of other
Eurybacteria to see whether it is present in all, or just in
Thermotoga, and also more broadly in deeper branching
Endobacteria. Note that in a recent 16S rRNA tree [114],
actinobacteria are sisters of archaebacteria plus Aquifex
and Thermotoga; given that this position of Aquifex and
Thermotoga is almost certainly a long-branch artefact, it
cannot be argued that the evidence from proteasomes for
the holophyly of proteates is contradicted by 16S rRNA
trees.
The possibility that Actinobacteria are sisters of neomura,
not ancestral to them as previously suggested [1], needs to
be seriously considered, as there are 14 proteins found in
all sequenced Actinobacteria, but no other organisms (K.
Chater pers. comm.), which would favour their holophyly. A sister relationship would also allow the endobacterial glycosyltransferases discussed in the next section
and the SRP Alu domain to have been both present in the
last common ancestor of neomura and actinobacteria,
and each to have been lost only once in the ancestor of
actinobacteria.
The outer sheath of the archaebacterium Ignicoccus is not
an exception to the unimembranous character of archaebacteria, even though it is sometimes misleadingly
referred to as an outer membrane [115]. It differs profoundly from the negibacterial outer membrane in chemistry, ultrastructure, and in its general lack of close contact
with the cell surface. Although it may contain diether isoprenoid lipids in addition to much protein, its biogenesis
differs profoundly from the non-homologous OM of negibacteria and it clearly originated independently. It thus
does not lessen the clear-cut separation of unibacteria and
negibacteria. Nor does it affect the validity of the arguments from cell wall/OM and flagellar evolution that
posibacteria evolved from negibacteria, not the reverse. It
appears to be an unusually interesting modification of the
crenarchaeote cell wall rather than a true membrane.
Recency of archaebacteria
I stress that the above arguments concerning evolution of
proteasomes, Omp85, flagella, and the cell envelope that
together unambiguously root the tree of life within negibacteria are mutually reinforcing and do not rely at all on
fossil evidence, yet fully agree with it [1]. Thus criteria of
congruence between independent lines of evidence are
well met. The proteasome argument uses the principle of
paralogue rooting, but relies on the irreversibility of the
divergence in structure and function of the core proteasomal subunits to polarize evolutionary direction. It is
therefore superior to methods using sequence trees, which
gave conflicting and debatable results because of tree

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

reconstruction problems [1,13,116]. The negibacterial
root of the tree establishes that the cenancestral cell had
acyl ester lipids like eubacteria and eukaryotes. The above
analysis disproves wild speculations that archaebacterial
and eubacterial cells evolved separately [107,108], which
exaggerate differences in their lipid and other biology. It is
worth emphasizing four features of membrane biology
that were present during the eubacteria to neomuran transition: (1) the membrane-embedded SRP receptor and the
transmembrane protein channel for cotranslational secretion (2) membrane division by FtsZ; (3) a respiratory
chain with membrane-embedded cytochrome b, plus
Rieske protein; (4) a mechanism for transporting
hydrophilic carbohydrate wall precursors (which
included N-acetylglucosamine residues) across a lipid
membrane by means of carrier isoprenols (undecaprenol/
dolichol) synthesized by an enzyme that is clearly homologous between eubacteria and archaebacteria. The last
point confirms my argument that there was some continuity between the mechanisms of formation of murein
peptidoglycan walls by eubacteria and of glycoprotein
walls by archaebacteria [29], despite the radical nature of
this changeover.
Furthermore, the integral membrane protein subunit of
the eukaryote enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase that actually transfers N-acetylglucosamine to dolichol phosphate is distantly homologous to a eubacterial
transferase (MurG) involved in murein synthesis, which
has two glycosyltransferase domains [117]. However, the
eukaryotic protein is even more closely related to the single domain glycosyltransferase that makes the capsular
polysaccharide (EpsE: [118]) of certain endobacteria by
transferring glucose from UDP-glucose to a C35 isoprenol
phosphate carrier; its highest BLAST hits are all to endobacteria, except for one to an archaebacterium, and there
are no BLAST hits to any α-proteobacteria; thus this
enzyme might have been inherited vertically from the
posibacterial ancestor of the host component of the
eukaryote cell. As single-domain homologues are so taxonomically restricted, they may have evolved from and
coexisted with MurG (present throughout eubacteria) in
Posibacteria after they diverged from Proteobacteria by
gene duplication and C-terminal truncation. The second,
non-membrane subunit of the eukaryotic enzyme appears
closest to other posibacterial single domain glycosyltransferases (WciR of Streptococcus and EpsF of Lactococcus). As
these single-domain transferases are all related to the Cterminal end of MurG [117], MurG probably duplicated
and split into two separate single domain glycosylases
within Posibacteria. Possibly both of them were recruited
by the ancestral neomuran for the first step of N-linked
glycoprotein synthesis, rather than MurG itself being
directly modified as assumed by the original version of
the neomuran theory [29]. Despite this difference in

Page 33 of 83

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

detail, this new evidence fits the prediction of vertical
inheritance of an integral membrane posibacterial wall
synthesis enzyme by eukaryotes during the neomuran revolution [29].
The fact that 683 protein fold superfamilies are shared by
eubacteria and archaebacteria, whereas only nine are
unique to archaebacteria [119] further emphasizes that
rRNA trees grossly exaggerate their molecular divergence.
The neomuran revolution clearly took place in a highly
developed cell with well over a thousand proteins and
advanced membrane biology, including isoprenoid lipid
carriers for surface carbohydrate secretion and fully developed prokaryotic division machinery. As Peretó et al. [18]
also convincingly argued, the transitional organism was
not a progenote without lipid membranes.
Three separate polarizations within the tree (the derived
nature of archaebacterial reverse gyrase [1]; the neomuran
revolution, discussed previously in detail [1]; the distinctly earlier origin of proteasomes from HslV) together
establish that archaebacteria were derived from actinobacteria-like posibacteria (most likely specifically from actinomycete relatives) and thus are the most recent
unibacterial phylum. Three further polarizations (the negibacteria to posibacteria transition, the glidobacterial
ancestry of flagella, and the still earlier origin of Omp85)
independently and together establish that unibacteria
evolved from negibacteria. These six polarisations
together show that archaebacteria are the youngest and
chlorobacteria probably the oldest bacterial phylum. The
conclusion that archaebacteria are the youngest bacterial
phylum is immensely stronger than the conclusion that
chlorobacteria are the oldest phylum as it stems from
numerous independent polarisations that would be very
hard to overturn, not just one.
I now present a new argument that for the first time
locates the negibacterial root, based on the recent discovery that Omp85 homologues are essential for inserting βbarrel proteins into the outer membrane of proteobacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts [120].
Chlorobacteria have the simplest outer membranes
Chlorobacteria [1] comprise filamentous 'non-sulphur'
green bacteria, e.g. Chloroflexus, Oscillochloris, Chloronema
and Heliothrix, which can be photoheterotrophs or photoautotrophs; colourless heterotrophs, including thermophiles (e.g. Thermomicrobium, Herpetosiphon); and
chlororespirers (Dehalococcoides). Given the importance of
Omp85 for insertion of all OM β-barrel proteins, it is
striking that my BLAST analysis reveals no clear homologues in the complete Dehalococcoides [121] and Chloroflexus
genomes
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
draft_microbes/chlau/chlau.home.html, even though

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

Omp85 is highly conserved and readily detectable in all
other negibacteria including the hadobacteria Deinococcus
and Thermus (e.g. Omp85 of the primitive cyanobacterium Gloeobacter has no BLASTP hits at all with Chlorobacteria but strongly hits sequences from every other
negibacterial phylum; Omp85 of the sphingobacterium
Bacteroides hits no Chlorobacteria but strongly hits other
negibacterial phyla; Omp85 of the deltabacterium Geobacter hits all negibacterial phyla but Chlorobacteria.
Moreover only five putative OM proteins have so far been
detected in Chloroflexus (fewer in Dehalococcoides), several
times fewer than in other negibacteria, including Hadobacteria, and do not include obvious homologues of typical OM β-barrel proteins. It is very unlikely that Omp85
homologues were lost by Chlorobacteria, as they have
been retained for OM protein targeting even in the highly
modified mitochondria and chloroplasts, descendants of
anciently enslaved negibacteria, and their loss by both
Escherichia coli and yeast is lethal [120]. I therefore argue
that their absence is strong evidence that Chlorobacteria
are the most primitive negibacteria of all and that they
diverged from all other negibacteria before Omp85-based
protein targeting evolved. This is consistent with their
being the most divergent of all photosynthetic eubacteria
on rRNA trees.
As advanced negibacteria (glycobacteria) have only β-barrel proteins in their outer membrane (also one α-,β-barrel) [122], determining what proteins Chlorobacteria use
as outer membrane pores and their targeting machinery
should throw considerable light on the origin of the first
negibacterium. Since β-barrel proteins are thermodynamically self-inserting above 30C [122], and Chlorobacteria
are either thermophiles or grow remarkably slowly, they
may manage, as the first negibacterium must have done
[31], without help from such strong catalysts of insertion
as Omp85. If Chlorobacteria all lack Omp85 homologues
and they were not lost, the root of the negibacterial part of
the universal tree must lie either between them and all
other negibacteria or within Chlorobacteria. This argument helps locate the universal root by excluding it from
or among any of the negibacterial phyla other than Chlorobacteria. Thus the root cannot be within proteates, posibacteria (or between them and negibacteria) or the
Omp85-containing negibacterial phyla. The only remaining possibilities are within either Chlorobacteria or
between them and all other organisms. Which of these is
true must be determined by future transition analyses
using other characters not considered here.
It is possible that Chlorobacteria do not entirely lack
Omp85 homologues, but have a relative too divergent for
detection by simple BLAST. This possibility is seriously
raised by the fact that the mitochondrial homologue
Sam50 is not detected by all prokaryote BLAST queries;

Page 34 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

moreover, using the Schizosaccharomyces pombe sequence
as BLAST query readily detects bacterial homologues, but
only within Gracilicutes, with the highest hits all from αproteobacteria as expected. The relatively high e-values of
~10-13 for its hits with plants indicates that Sam50 has a
markedly elevated evolutionary rate compared with negibacterial or chloroplast Omp85 homologues, which may
be because its function changed greatly with the evolution
of mitochondrial protein import and interaction with
novel proteins. However as Chlorobacteria are exclusively
free-living, not enslaved endosymbionts, there is no particular reason to expect such an elevated rate of evolution
for them; if they do have very divergent Omp85s, this is
likely to reflect either a very early divergence and/or a
much less constrained pattern of interactions with other
proteins than in any other negibacteria. If that were to
prove the case, it would support rather than contradict the
thesis that they are the most primitive negibacteria in
terms of OM structure. Indeed the presence of such a
highly divergent Omp85 would rule out any possible
objection to my conclusion on the grounds that it might
have been lost from Chlorobacteria, but without such loss
being as harmful as I would expect it to be.
The apparent absence of a full sized homologue in Thermotoga is perhaps not surprising, as there has long been
doubt whether it is a negibacterium or not [1], as its toga
differs so greatly from a typical OM, both in chemical
composition and in not being closely attached to the cytoplasmic membrane via a peptidoglycan sacculus.
Although it has sometimes been classified as a posibacterium, I argued above that Thermotoga flagella structure
shows that it is a negibacterium and that other evidence
suggests that its frequent grouping on sequence trees with
the also hyperthermophilic Aquifex, may be an artefact
and that it is really related to Selenobacteria. Its novel
togal morphology probably entailed drastic changes in
OM morphogenesis when it originated, so Omp85 itself
may then have changed equally dramatically (assuming
that the small 403-amino-acid protein, AAD36794,
detected by BLAST with a very weak e-value of 1.6, is
derived from it). Aquifex, which often groups with Thermotoga on sequence trees, has a far better conserved full
length Omp-homologue (NP_213890) with highest hits
to deltabacteria (although I classified it in Epsilobacteria
[1]). As, by contrast, the chlorobacterial OM is morphologically normal, there is no reason to invoke an analogous drastic secondary change in their OM
morphogenesis to explain the apparent absence of
Omp85 from Chlorobacteria (both BLAST and PSI-BLAST
were used to search in Chlorobacteria).
In all bacterial phyla except Chlorobacteria BLAST
revealed homologues of the FtsX-domain-containing
cytoplasmic membrane proteins LolC and LolE, which

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

suggests that the OM lipoprotein transport machinery
also of chlorobacteria may be more primitive than in any
other bacteria. In proteobacteria of subphylum Rhodobacteria (purple bacteria) these associate with an ABC
family membrane ATPase LolD that provides energy for
release of OM lipoproteins from the cytoplasmic membrane into the periplasm. There they bind to a chaperone
LolA, which releases them to a related OM lipoprotein
LolB [123]that places them in the OM. It is unclear
whether LolA and LolB are present outside Rhodobacteria
as they evolve too rapidly for detection by BLAST over
large evolutionary distances. Either LolC and E originated
only after Chlorobacteria diverged (Fig. 7) or they have
too divergent homologues to detect. Like all other bacteria
they have plenty of ABC ATPases, one of which could have
been recruited later to help with lipoprotein release.
Negibacterial monophyly and lipopolysaccharide
evolution
Six negibacterial phyla have lipopolysaccharide in the
outer leaflet of their outer membrane. As its synthesis is so
complex [59], it could not have evolved twice independently or be transmitted by lateral gene transfer. Therefore
the monophyly of these six phyla (known collectively as
glycobacteria [1], i.e. all negibacteria except Chlorobacteria and Hadobacteria) has long been clear [30] (though
often overlooked). My finding Omp85 in Hadobacteria
(by BLAST) indicates that glycobacteria plus Hadobacteria
all had a common ancestor that was the first to evolve
Omp85. On rRNA trees Chlorobacteria are deeply divergent from other negibacteria, but do not group with either
of the two posibacterial subphyla (Actinobacteria or
Endobacteria) or with neomura. Therefore there is no reason to doubt that the eight negibacterial phyla are collectively monophyletic despite the absence of a wellconserved Omp85 from Chlorobacteria. The arguments
presented above clearly establish that negibacteria are not
the holophyletic descendants of posibacteria, as Gupta
assumed [79], but their paraphyletic ancestors as Blobel
[57] suggested and I explained in detail [1,29,30].

With a negibacterial root to eubacteria, Omp85 would
inevitably have been lost when posibacteria lost the outer
membrane, which would have been entirely harmless
because its essential function of inserting β-barrel proteins
would simply have gone. I postulated that was its only
loss in the history of life [1,5,29,30]. The greater simplicity
of the chlorobacterial OM, with neither lipopolysaccharides nor apparently an Omp85 protein-targeting mechanism, is what one expects of the earliest negibacteria, and
is unlikely to have been caused by secondary loss of
Omp85 alone while retaining an OM; there is no evidence
that such loss has ever occurred in the whole history of
life. Although the unique absence of a well-conserved
homologue of Omp85 from the OM of Chlorobacteria is

Page 35 of 83

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

strong evidence that they are the most ancient negibacteria, it does not by itself prove that they are the most
ancient eubacteria of all. To do that we must also exclude
the root from all Posibacteria; proteasome evolution
excludes it only from Actinomycetales and neomura, and
thus left open the possibility that it might be beside or
within Endobacteria (or even among early actinobacteria). As argued above, negibacterial envelope biogenesis is
so complex as to polarise the transition from negibacteria,
not the reverse, and thus exclude the root from all unibacteria. My new arguments concerning flagella evolution
also clearly place the root within negibacteria, specifically
among Glidobacteria. When discussing the origin of flagella I pointed out that the root cannot lie within Spirochaetae, or within Sphingobacteria, which have a unique
form of gliding motility not related to flagella. I now give
further evidence that, although not as compelling as the
polarizations discussed above, nonetheless also indicates
that Gracilicutes are a major derived group within Negibacteria.
Gracilicutes are probably a clade
Three negibacterial phyla that share a rare 4-amino acid
insertion in alanyl-tRNA synthetase [1,81] together correspond closely to the classical division Gracilicutes, so I
designate them 'core gracilicutes' (Proteobacteria, Sphingobacteria, Planctobacteria). They also all share a β-β'
module domain 1 (BBM1) inserted into the universally
conserved second sandwich barrel hybrid motif (SBHM)
domain in the RNA polymerase β-subunit [82]. Since
SBHM and BBM1 domains are both well conserved and
present at different locations in various proteins, they
were somewhat genetically mobile during early evolution.
As the BBM1 domain interrupts the SBHM domain it was
inserted after the β-subunit of RNA polymerase first
evolved and is thus a derived state compared with genes
lacking that insertion. Unless this insertion has been
reversed since the gene originated in some or all other bacteria, this excludes the root of the tree from core gracilicutes. Two shared single-amino-acid insertions in the
highly conserved bacterial division protein FtsZ and chaperonin Hsp60 suggested that core gracilicutes are sisters of
spirochaetes [1,81]. This is now supported by a very large
alpha-helical insertion in RNA polymerase D/σ70 in Proteobacteria, Planctobacteria, and Spirochaetae [82];
Sphingobacteria, uniquely among eubacteria, have a large
N-terminal deletion of this molecule, so the absence of
the α-helical insertion in Sphingobacteria might also
reflect a secondary deletion, possibly caused by the same
shift in function associated with the first. I have here resurrected the name Gracilicutes, discontinued as a phylum
name, slightly more broadly to include Spirochaetae also,
which are evidently more closely related to core gracilicutes than to other eubacteria. Gracilicutes are weakly holophyletic on a Bayesian concatenated 16S/23S rRNA tree

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

[80] (except for the probably incorrect exclusion of
Aquifex) and strongly holophyletic on the concatenated
ribosomal protein and two of the four RNA polymerase
subunit trees of [82]. All four gracilicute phyla also share
a β-β' module 1 domain inserted into the β' subunit of
RNA polymerase.
Probably these insertions were complexities added in the
gracilicute common ancestor to improve transcription or
its control. Proteobacteria include many of the fastest
growing, most phenotypically adaptable bacteria – for
which rapid transcription and its efficient switching is
important. Possibly these RNA polymerase insertions
helped them enter this adaptive zone. These insertions
polarize change from the simpler eobacterial RNA
polymerase to the more complex gracilicute polymerase.
If correct, this excludes the universal root from all Gracilicutes. In my view this argument, though reasonable, is
not as compelling as the Omp85, cell wall, and flagellar
arguments for polarising the tree, because the two gracilicute-wide RNA polymerase insertions and the FtsZ and
Hsp90 insertions (Fig. 7) might have been argued to have
been deletions instead if other evidence had suggested
that the universal root was within gracilicutes. Even the
evidence from the core gracilicute insertion is less strong
than for Omp85, cell walls, and flagella, where there are
strong reasons for thinking that evolution could not have
gone in the reverse direction.
The main importance of these six indels, apart from their
congruence with the rooting based on Omp85, is that they
partition bacteria into two large groups, one derived and
one ancestral: the gracilicutes and the eobacteria/posibacteria. Other evidence (Omp85) is stronger for the gracilicutes being derived and holophyletic and eobacteria/
posibacteria paraphyletic. In eukaryotes analogous molecular cladistic characters have been of very great value in
partitioning major taxa into supergroups, especially
where gene sequence trees have lacked sufficient resolution to do so or have given positively misleading answers
because of systematic bias; the most striking examples are
the recent partitioning of eukaryotes into unikonts and
bikonts by a gene fusion and myosin synapomorphies
(Fig. 7) [3,4,28] and the very strong support from gene
replacements for the chromalveolates [124,125]. Such
characters are at least as important in the much older
eubacteria where gene trees are usually still less well
resolved at the base, probably through a combination of
substitutional saturation and rapid early radiation of all
eubacterial phyla.
Importantly, the insertions place all Posibacteria in the
same category: Actinobacteria and Endobacteria both lack
all five. If they were polyphyletic any insertion could have
placed them in different clades. The hyperthermophilic

Page 36 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

eubacterium Aquifex has all of the gracilicute-specific
insertions [82]. Several authors have reasonably argued
that the degree of separation of the Aquifex/Thermotoga
branch from other eubacteria on rRNA trees and some
protein trees may be an artefact of their shared hyperthermophily, which so strongly biases base composition
towards GC as to be likely to bias amino acid sequences
also. Aquifex clearly groups with Proteobacteria with some
of the most conserved proteins (e.g. cytochromes b and c
[126], phosphoglycerate kinase [127]); I formally classified them thus [1]. Aquifex has both Omp85 and the Skp
chaperone for insertion of OM proteins, like Proteobacteria and all Gracilicutes. Moreover there is an Aquifex/Proteobacteria-specific insert in RNA polymerase β, and on
the trees for the two largest subunits (therefore most reliable) Aquifex was robustly within Proteobacteria as sister
to ε-Proteobacteria [82], where it is classified [1], which is
fully congruent with the flagellar evidence discussed
above. Thus cladistic molecular characters agree with cladistic morphological characters and significant protein
trees and disagree with the probably systematically biased
rRNA tree [1]. Assuming instead that the rRNA tree is correct, and postulating lateral transfer of RNA polymerase
genes from proteobacteria [82], was unwarranted.
Thermotoga is more problematic. It lacks both gracilicute
RNA polymerase insertions, the gracilicute Hsp60 insertion, and the core gracilicute RNA polymerase insertion,
while its Omp85 homologue is unusually small, and Skp
(a chaperone otherwise found in all negibacteria except
Chlorobacteria and Cyanobacteria: see next section) is not
detectable. Thermotoga probably lacks the gracilicute FtsZ
insertion, but its FtsZ alignment in the region is slightly
ambiguous, so one cannot be sure that precisely the same
amino acid is missing from Thermotoga as in Posibacteria,
though it may be; moreover, a dozen residues downstream, sphingobacterial FtsZ has suffered a two-aminoacid deletion, showing that a nearby region of the molecule in gracilicutes is not totally immune to secondary
deletion. As each of these five independent insertions
could in principle have been secondarily deleted (or lost
by gene conversion from one of its many laterally transferred foreign genes), they are not totally decisive evidence
against placing Thermotogales with Aquifex in Thiobacteria. Yet they are strong reasons for not doing so lightly, i.e.
just because of potentially biased sequence trees grouping
Thermotoga and Aquifex. Although Thermotoga shares a
sizeable deletion in Hsp70 with Posibacteria, it does not
actually branch with them on the tree so this also might
be convergent. A small RNA polymerase D domain deletion [82] also links Thermotoga and Posibacteria, but
might be convergent. It is important to note that the evidence from indels is asymmetric. A highly conserved
insertion, e.g. that in the alanyl-tRNA synthetase of core
gracilicutes or the RNA polymerases domains is evidence

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

of a common ancestry, but the absence of an insertion is
more ambiguous as species without it may be a mixture of
those that never had it and diverged earlier and those that
underwent a secondary deletion at the same place. Even
though comparative studies show that partial gene deletions have been rampant in Thermotoga, the fact that all
seven indels mentioned are congruent in excluding it
from the Gracilicutes and grouping it instead with Eurybacteria gives them collectively much more force than if
each was considered on its own. As Thermotoga has lost
Hsp90 we cannot use its deletion (Fig. 7) to place it, but
the glycerol-1-P dehydrogenase tree and the very presence
of that unusual enzyme [18] clearly support its being a sister to Posibacteria. Genome sequences for Selenobacteria,
the phenotypically least derived Eurybacteria are badly
needed to test its current placement in Eurybacteria (Table
1). Studies of toga biogenesis are also greatly needed, both
to test that it really is a highly modified negibacterial OM
and to understand how and why that modification
occurred.
The glycobacterial revolution
The monophyly of the exclusively non-photosynthetic
Hadobacteria (often informally, but clumsily known as
the Deinococcus-Thermus group) is generally accepted but
there is no consensus on their precise evolutionary position. Chlorobacteria and Hadobacteria sometimes group
weakly together on rRNA trees, but often do not. As they
have ornithine not diaminopimelic acid in their murein
cell wall polymer and are the only negibacteria lacking
lipopolysaccharide or lipo-oligosaccharide in their outer
membrane, I grouped them as phylum and infrakingdom
Eobacteria [1]. Eo-('dawn') emphasised that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) absence may be primitive and they could be
the earliest cells. Although I still think that both phyla
primitively lack LPS and diaminopimelic acid, I now consider Chlorobacteria as markedly more primitive than
Hadobacteria and that Eobacteria are paraphyletic, not
holophyletic [1]. Given also the large number of differences between Chlorobacteria and Hadobacteria summarised in Fig. 7 it is now sensible to treat them as separate
phyla, rather than subphyla, within a superphylum
Eobacteria (Table 1), which I now group with Cyanobacteria as the new infrakingdom Glidobacteria: ancestrally
gliding bacterial invariably without flagella, i.e. all the
primitively non-flagellate negibacteria. LPS is typically
composed of the very complex lipid A, which anchors it in
the OM outer leaflet, a core oligosaccharide and an external O-antigen, which is typically a long polysaccharide
but has been reduced to an oligosaccharide in spirochaetes, or sometimes lost as in Neisseria. Lipid A is variable in
structure but typically has a glucosamine disaccharide
backbone with about six acyl ester hydrocarbon tails. The
very great complexity of LPS makes it implausible as a
primitive state for negibacteria, as does the complex, only

Page 37 of 83

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

partially characterized, machinery for exporting its precursors made in the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane across that membrane and mature molecules across
the periplasm to the OM [60]. I shall argue that it can only
be lost by glycobacteria if its impermeabilizing function is
replaced by another complex lipid.
Placing both Chlorobacteria and Hadobacteria at the base
of the tree would have been incorrect if either had lost
LPS. It has long been known that LPS was lost when a proteobacterium was converted to the first mitochondrion
and when a cyanobacterium was converted to the first
chloroplast. In both cases host phosphatidylcholine
replaced it in the outer leaflet of the bilayer [105]. It is also
obvious that LPS was lost together with the OM when the
first posibacterium evolved from a eurybacterium, as
explained above. The fact that loss of LPS is exceedingly
rare among negibacteria that have retained an OM and
never been enslaved and converted into eukaryotic
organelles means that it possesses a really fundamental
function that is almost universally required and not readily replaced. I know of only two groups of glycobacteria
that have lost LPS: spirochaetes and the α-proteobacterium Sphingomonas. These natural experiments clearly
reveal LPS function to be making a very rigid non-fluid
outer surface that is impermeable to small foreign hydrophobic molecules that might disrupt cytoplasmic membrane functions [59].
Spirochaetes either modified LPS (Leptospira [58]) or lost
it (others). I suggest that this was done to increase the flexibility of the OM as required for their corkscrewing motility by endoflagella; the obligate parasites that lost it may
need less protection from foreign hydrophobic permeants
within their animal hosts. There is no risk in confusing
their condition with the primitive absence of LPS in Chlorobacteria and Hadobacteria, which presumably have
phospholipids in the outer leaflet of their OM as in the
cytoplasmic membrane. There is other compelling evidence that spirochaetes are morphologically the most
derived, not the most primitive negibacteria. The spirochaete state is not a primitive or a simple state; it would be
unreasonable to suppose that spirochaetes without LPS
are the most primitive bacteria as all can only grow inside
animals.
Sphingomonas did not abandon the protective role of LPS
when it lost it. It was only able to lose LPS by replacing it
with a complex glycosphingolipid (D-glucuronosylceramide), found also in about six related genera of α-proteobacteria, and with precisely the same protective properties
[59]. Sphingolipids, however, are somewhat less rigid
than LPS, which may be why it was replaced. Sphingobacteria were thus named because many of them supplemented rather than replaced their LPS by sphingolipids,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

best studied in Flavobacteria, e.g. Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Sphingobacterium. As they use chemically different
types of sphingolipids (the sugarless ceramides or sphingophospholipids) from Sphingomonas [59], this supplementation probably evolved independently of the
replacement of LPS in Sphingomonas, though no doubt
sphingosine itself arose in the common ancestor of Proteobacteria and Sphingobacteria. The Cytophaga-Flexibacter group of Sphingobacteria partially replaced their
LPS instead by the chemically somewhat related sulphonolipids rather than sphingolipids. It was proposed that
these Flavobacteria supplemented their LPS by sulfonolipids to make the OM less rigid and thus facilitate their
novel gliding mechanism [59]. The extreme halophile
Salinibacter, which is related to them but unusually has
flagella [95], also has sulfonolipids [128].Flavobacterium
johnsoniae appears to use both sulphonolipids and ornithine lipids for this purpose [59]. It is known that beads
attached to flavobacterial surfaces are propelled along the
OM; possibly the motors doing this require a fluid rather
than rigid outer leaflet of the OM. I suggest that the origin
of lipoprotein-based gliding motility took place in the
sphingobacterial cenancestor prior to the widespread loss
of flagella and that the addition of the sphingolipids, sulfonolipids and/or ornithine lipids to the OM were secondary adaptations for fast gliding motility that probably
occurred somewhat later, after the divergence of Chlorobea and Flavobacteria and the ancestor of Flavobacteria
lost chlorosomes with their unique lipid monolayer structure. Phylogenetic studies of sphingobacterial lipid-synthesising enzymes are needed to test this. Thus the
unusual lipid composition of most, if not all, Sphingobacteria is probably coadaptive with their gliding motility
and not arbitrarily coincidental, supporting the view that
coadaptation among disparate cell properties is often a
key to understanding cell megaevolution [29,129], which
single character or single molecule studies (e.g. 16S rRNA)
necessarily fail to illuminate.
I now suggest that the evolution of LPS was not a trivial
matter, but of immense adaptive significance for negibacterial evolution, as it also necessarily entailed the origin of
numerous OM porins, whose origin was itself coadaptive
with the origin of LPS. The hollow cylindrical β-barrel
porins are absolutely essential for glycobacteria (here simply treated as a monophyletic grade, not a formal taxon as
previously [1]), but less so for Eobacteria. Porins have two
major functions. First, to allow the passive entry or active
import of nutrients that cannot diffuse through the impermeable LPS outer leaflet of the OM or which do so too
slowly for the cell's growth requirements. Second, to
actively expel harmful foreign molecules that still seep in
slowly despite the high degree of impermeability of the
OM. Thus the evolution of active expulsion mechanisms
and of greater impermeability by evolving LPS are both

part of the same suite of adaptations that occurred during
the transition from Eobacteria to glycobacteria. I now call
this the glycobacterial revolution, and argue that it probably involved numerous dramatic and essentially simultaneous innovations in OM cell biology.
Two key innovations seem to have been the origin of the
TonB complex, important for subsequent evolution of
flagella, as discussed above, and the origin of type I secretion by means of TolC. TolC is a remarkably long (14 nm)
hollow cylinder that penetrates the OM but is attached at
its base to an ABC transporter embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane, and which pumps secretory products into
the TolC lumen from the cytosol [130]. The tube is
formed by three TolC proteins; TolC differs fundamentally from other membrane proteins in being neither a βbarrel (typical OM proteins of glycobacteria) or simple αhelical proteins (cytoplasmic membrane proteins) but is a
unique α-β-barrel. Its periplasmic part is an α-helical tunnel, which is covalently contiguous with its β-barrel channel embedded in the OM. TolC is open to the outside
medium but closed by an iris-like mechanism at its periplasmic entrance. When it binds to the ABC transporter
laden with substrate, the α-helical iris opens allowing the
substrate to pass out through a tube spanning the entire
cell envelope, from the cytosol to the exterior [130]. TolC
acts to expel harmful organic molecules made by other
organisms, and probably would not have been important
until after chemical warfare by secondary metabolites
among inhabitants of microbial mats became an unavoidable fact of life. TolC seems likely to have evolved by gene
fusion between an α-barrel protein and a pre-existing βbarrel protein, and thus for that reason also can hardly
have been present in the most primitive negibacteria.
As secretion of TolC into the periplasm/OM itself depends
on Omp85 [131,132], it must have evolved after Omp85.
In keeping with this, TolC is absent from Eobacteria but
present in all glycobacteria (but unsurprisingly no unibacteria). Its assembly does not require the presence of LPS in
the OM, so it might have evolved prior to LPS. In
Escherichia other OM proteins (e.g. OmpF/C) appear to
require LPS for their correct assembly and thus might be
argued to have originated after LPS evolved, but dependence on LPS is not universal as Neisseria can dispense with
it at least in the laboratory [60], weakening such an interpretation. Other OM assembly mechanisms, e.g. requirement for the periplasmic chaperone SurA, itself insertable
into the OM (detectable homologues only in Proteobacteria with some very distant hits in Sphingobacteria), may
have evolved even later. Omp85 is essential also for these,
as expected if it evolved prior to all glycobacteria as shown
on Figs 3, 7.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

The complexity of the import and transducing mechanisms mediated by TonB, and the fact that like Type I
secretion it depends on a complex cooperation of dissimilar cytoplasmic and OM proteins, is also such that they
can hardly have been present in the first negibacterium
just after its OM had differentiated from the cytoplasmic
membrane during the formation of the ancestral cell [31].
Absence of both TolC and TonB as well as the very complex lipopolysaccharide are all to be expected from the
most primitive negibacteria, which further supports the
rooting within eobacteria. A major research programme is
needed into OM biogenesis and physiology in Eobacteria
to see whether it is really substantially more primitive
than that of glycobacteria, as I have argued. Reviews on
bacterial OMs often assert that many of the proteins that I
have been unable to find in Eobacteria are present in 'all'
Negibacteria; as many biologists whose main experience
is on medically important bacteria or models like E. coli
also falsely assume that all negibacteria have LPS, this mistake is not surprising. Even more proteins widely assumed
to be general for negibacteria are probably missing from
Chlorobacteria, but present in Hadobacteria. These probably evolved after Chlorobacteria, but prior to the divergence between Hadobacteria and Cyanobacteria, which I
must now discuss.
Photosystem duplication, catalase, and the great
oxygenation event
The absence of Omp85 in Chlorobacteria strongly argues
that they preceded Hadobacteria. Eleven other synapomorphies shared by Hadobacteria and most eubacteria
(Fig. 7), but absent from Chlorobacteria, support the conclusion from Omp85 that Hadobacteria are less primitive
than Chlorobacteria and arose later. These include the
HslVU protease discussed above (only in Thermus), a
small chaperone protein (Skp) important in preventing
aggregation of OM proteins in the periplasmic space [60],
and monofunctional catalases belonging to clades 1 and
2 [133]. These haem catalases are not detectable by BLAST
in Thermus, which seems only to have manganese catalases, so it is likely that they were lost or altered beyond
recognition by Thermus when it became a thermophile.

One might expect catalases and other hydroperoxidases to
be absent or less diverse before the atmosphere became
oxygenic. Hydroperoxidases, of five major types, destroy
the poison hydrogen peroxide generated by active oxygen.
As oxygen concentrations were low when life began, Klotz
and Loewen [133] suggested that the first to evolve were
rubredoxin peroxidases, which become saturated at low
(micromolar) peroxide concentrations, a limitation not
then a drawback. Rubredoxin peroxidases have a 1,000fold higher specificity for H2O2 than the other four types
(catalases) and occur in all major groups of organisms,
including Chlorobacteria and cyanobacteria. I suggest that

Page 39 of 83

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

the unrelated catalases evolved only when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved and vastly increased oxygen levels.
Their advantages, despite lower specificity, are much
higher turnover rates and saturation levels that could cope
with greatly increased levels of peroxide after the early
Proterozoic 'great oxygenation event' caused by cyanobacteria and their immediate ancestors [134]. Monofunctional catalases probably evolved soon after oxygenic
photosynthesis. They would have originated in the common ancestor of Hadobacteria and Cyanobacteria: all
organisms except Chlorobacteria (Figs 3, 7).
Some readers may wonder how I can argue that catalases
originated in the common ancestor of Hadobacteria and
Cyanobacteria as a response to oxygenic photosynthesis,
if Hadobacteria diverged before Cyanobacteria. It is often
loosely stated that cyanobacteria invented oxygenic photosynthesis. However this need not be true, and is probably strictly incorrect. There is good evidence from many
sources (e.g. [135]) that extant cyanobacteria are holophyletic. Therefore both phycobilisomes and oxygenic
photosynthesis must have been already present in the
cenancestor and must have evolved earlier still. If phycobilisomes evolved after oxygenic photosynthesis (Fig. 7),
the first organism that generated oxygen was not actually
a cyanobacterium but an evolutionary precursor. Since the
haem oxygenases that split the porphyrin ring to make
phycobilins require oxygen, they and phycobilisomes
probably both evolved after oxygenic photosynthesis.
Haem oxygenases are unknown in eobacteria and probably first evolved during the glycobacterial revolution.
However a few other oxygenases are found in Chloroflexus,
which can live both anaerobically and aerobically. If
Chlorobacteria are indeed the earliest diverging bacteria
and diverged before oxygenic photosynthesis and two
photosystems evolved, as argued here, they must have
been ancestrally anaerobic. I therefore predict that phylogenetic analysis of all oxygen-requiring enzymes in the
phylum will show that all arose secondarily, either by
modification of ancestrally oxygen-independent enzymes
or by lateral gene transfer from more advanced phyla.
Chloroflexus makes structurally different enzymes for some
steps in haem and bacteriochlorophyll synthesis [136]; as
one enzyme functions under anoxic conditions and the
other performs the same reaction in oxic conditions, this
dichotomy might reflect a later recruitment of the oxic
enzymes. Lateral gene transfer is the likely explanation of
the presence of the intradiol ring cleavage dioxygenase of
Chloroflexus and Deinococcus; they are not detectable in
other eobacterial genomes and are too similar to those of
actinobacteria for vertical inheritance to be believable,
though phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm this.
The 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, involved in
aerobic tyrosine degradation, of Chloroflexus is even more

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

similar to those of actinobacteria, making lateral transfer
very likely.
It is generally accepted that photosystem I and photosystem II, which carries the oxygenic reaction centre, arose by
duplication and divergence from a common ancestor that
had only a single photosystem. Just when in the tree did
this duplication occur? Clues come from the fact that the
two partly photosynthetic gracilicute phyla (Proteobacteria, Sphingobacteria) have very different photosystems. As
Fig. 9 indicates, that of green sulphur bacteria such as
Chlorobium resembles photosystem I of cyanobacteria,
whereas that of purple bacteria is more like photosystem
II of cyanobacteria. Given the root of the tree in or beside
Chlorobacteria, it is entirely unnecessary to postulate lateral gene transfer of complete photosystems as is sometimes unparsimoniously done. Vertical inheritance alone
can very simply explain the known diversity of photosystems and their distribution among phyla given the root
and topology of the eubacterial tree as now deduced by
cladistic and transition analysis (Figs 3 and 7).
As Gracilicutes are almost certainly holophyletic, their
common ancestor probably still retained both photosystems, which must have duplicated prior to the somewhat
older common ancestor that it shared with cyanobacteria.
Photosystem II was lost by the ancestor of Sphingobacteria only after it diverged from the ancestor of Proteobacteria, which retained it but replaced the ancestral
chlorosome pigments by new purple pigments to allow
spectral niche differentiation; they lost photosystem I
instead. The flagellate, and probably ancestrally facultatively aerobic, purple bacteria could colonise the open
water above the cyanobacterial benthic mats, while the
non-flagellate green sulphur bacteria could glide down
below them to exploit light frequencies that filtered
through. They lost photosystem II, as did the ancestors of
Eurybacteria from which Heliobacteria evolved. The common ancestor of Gracilicutes and Eurybacteria must still
have had chlorosomes, if we reject lateral gene transfer of
entire photosystems and antenna complexes as unparsimonious and less likely than simple vertical inheritance.
Thus its earlier ancestor that gave rise to cyanobacteria
also had chlorosomes too; phycobilisomes would have
evolved only after the ancestor of cyanobacteria diverged
from it (Fig. 7), which is in keeping with the other evidence that cyanobacteria are holophyletic. On this simple
interpretation involving only gene duplication and divergence, the hypothetical duplicated intermediate shown in
the box in Fig. 9 would have had only a transient evolutionary existence if cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, Chlorobiales and heliobacteria all diverged in a single bout of
photosynthetic niche differentiation immediately following the glycobacterial revolution. Thus on this interpretation it was a green eobacterium that invented oxygenic

Hypothetical phylogeny for photosynthetic reaction centres
Hypothetical phylogeny for photosynthetic reaction centres.
Prior to the last common ancestor of all extant life the primitive reaction centre, a homodimer with two bound quinones, each donating electrons to a primitive cytochrome cc
complex, evolved into the heterodimeric type found in green
non-sulphur bacteria (Chlorobacteria). This was duplicated
prior to divergence of cyanobacteria and gracilicutes to generate a modified homodimeric type of cytochrome bc1 complex with iron-sulphur clusters (FF); for a mechanistic
explanation of this duplication see [126]. Cyanobacteria converted the two versions into photosystems I and II. Proteobacteria replaced chlorosomes in the original heterodimeric
type by an H subunit with purple carotenoid, but did not
retain the new duplicate with FeS clusters. By contrast, this
was the only version retained by green sulphur bacteria
(Sphingobacteria) and Heliobacteria, both losing the earlier
heterodimeric type. This scenario is simplified from ref. 1 and
congruent with the cladistic tree in Fig. 7 and the concatenated rRNA tree [80] and is compatible with photosynthetic
protein trees, if properly rooted (see text).

photosynthesis, not a cyanobacterium. Since Hadobacteria are non-photosynthetic, their ancestor must have lost

photosynthesis after it diverged from the chlorosomecontaining ancestor of cyanobacteria. Such a transitional
intermediate between Chlorobacteria and Cyanobacteria
was also postulated by the redox switch hypothesis [137],
an ingenious and plausible mechanistic explanation for
the photosystem duplication assumed by Fig. 9 that
requires no lateral gene transfer; this intermediate would
be the first organism to have generated oxygen internally
and thus need catalase. Lateral transfer is also not needed
to explain evolution of cyanobacterial core antenna
domains
[138].
Cladistic arguments do not tell us whether the photosystem duplicated before or after the divergence of hadobacteria. However the fact that catalases apparently first
evolved in that common ancestor suggests that it itself had
already evolved oxygenic photosynthesis and evolved catalases to protect itself from damage from its own oxidising
excreta. Thus Hadobacteria evolved by losing both the
freshly duplicated photosystems and specialising on heterotrophy. The exceptional radiation resistance of Deinococcus could date back to the time when its relatives that
evolved oxygenic photosynthesis had not yet oxygenated
the atmosphere sufficiently to provide an ozone layer protective against UV. If, as suggested above, the radiation of
glycobacterial photosynthesizers was very rapid, the new
duplicate photosystem that evolved prior to their last
common ancestor could have retained its originally
homodimeric character until the Heliobacteria and
Sphingobacteria split off from the common stem, becoming fully differentiated as a heterodimeric reaction centre
only in the single ancestral cyanobacterial lineage (Fig. 9).
This appears to be a simpler interpretation of photosynthetic diversification than almost any others previously
published, and one that is fully consistent with the evolution of the rest of the cell, and also reasonably so with
most sequence trees, provided that they are correctly
rooted.
The above interpretation places the origin and primary
radiation of glycobacteria immediately after the origin of
oxygenic photosynthesis; only Hadobacteria diverged earlier, though possibly as little as a few thousand years
before the glycobacterial revolution. I suggest that the vast
expansion of a photosynthetically active population that
used water rather than hydrogen or hydrogen sulphide as
the source of reductant for carbon dioxide fixation and the
hugely greater supply of carbohydrate now available was
what stimulated the evolution of the much more complex
OM of glycobacteria. Higher population densities would
have yielded far more harmful products of death and
decay and far more biocidal small molecules made by the
more elaborate secondary metabolism that would then
have become possible and likely through more intensive
interference competition, against which LPS would have

Page 41 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

been protective and also provide the lavish supply of carbohydrate needed to make it. Higher population densities
would stimulate such chemical warfare and the struggle
for resources. On this interpretation only Chlorobacteria
are relics of the days before the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis and rich supplies of carbohydrate. Oxygen itself
could have led to there being a greater variety of small
harmful lipophilic molecules in the environment against
which an LPS coat and active extrusion by TolC would be
important complementary defences. This illustrates how
the new chlorobacterial rooting gives new insights into
the reasons for the structural diversity of negibacterial cell
envelopes, and the distribution of protections against oxygen such as catalase. The intensive study of all aspects of
chlorobacterial cell biology and ecology should have
more than anything else to teach us about the nature of
early life.
It was previously suggested [133] that the single case of a
clade 3 catalase enzyme in cyanobacteria was the result of
lateral transfer. However, phylogenetic evidence for that
lateral transfer is unconvincing; many fewer lateral transfers and losses need be postulated with the present phylogeny than assumed earlier [133]. If clade 3 enzymes were
ancestrally present in cyanobacteria, their origin on Fig. 7
must be moved below that of cyanobacteria and additional losses assumed; this small enzyme would then be
the ancestral monofunctional catalase, which later underwent two gene duplications and divergence to generate
another small (clade 1) and a larger (clade 2) paralogue,
both present in Deinococcus and many Posibacteria and
Proteobacteria (but not archaebacteria, apart from a probable lateral transfer of a clade 2 gene to Methanosarcina
mazei [133]). If cyanobacteria ancestrally lacked clade 3
catalase [133], it probably originated later by duplication
of a clade 1 gene after divergence of Hadobacteria, which
lack it (Fig. 7); in either case a small version of the enzyme
is likely the ancestral type, not, as previously suggested
[133], the more complex clade 2 type, with extra end
domains important only for quaternary structure. Clade 3
catalase was retained by neomura (including in
opisthokont peroxisomes), except for green plants having
the clade 1 type instead.
The catalase paralogue tree further exemplifies the poor
resolution and conflicting results given by metabolic
enzyme paralogue trees [1]: the clade A subtree places the
root within eubacteria, specifically within Endobacteria
[133]; if the A subtree is treated as unrooted it would have
clear bipartitions between neomura and eubacteria,
between eukaryotes/unibacteria (i.e. all organisms with a
single surface membrane) and negibacteria (all with two),
and between negibacteria and posibacteria – topologies
entirely consistent with Fig. 7 (apart from the lateral transfer to Methanosarcina mazei [133]); but the long branch

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

'outgroup' (clade 1 and 2) incorrectly gives spurious midpoint rooting: moreover if the clade 3 enzyme is older, as
suggested above, this assumed outgroup is actually an ingroup and not expected to give the correct root, even if
group 3 catalase existed in Chlorobacteria.
Mn catalase and catalase-peroxidase are more widespread
in cyanobacteria [133] and probably evolved in the common ancestor of Cyanobacteria and all other organisms
except Chlorobacteria.
Implications for cytochrome evolution
It was recently discovered that chlorobacterial photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains contain
remarkably different protein complexes from all other
organisms and do not contain cytochrome b [139]. Given
the new rooting of the tree of life by Omp85, this can be
simply interpreted as the ancestral state for all cells, with
cytochrome b evolving only later (Figs 3, 7) in the common ancestor of cyanobacteria and all other, more
advanced, cells – another feature of the glycobacterial revolution. It was also found that a very well conserved
operon, the MFIcc operon, is widely found in negibacteria
from Chlorobacteria upwards on the tree of Figs 3, 7, but
not in cyanobacteria or Unibacteria. This operon appears
ancestrally to have comprised a multihaem cytochrome c
(M), a MoCo subunit and an FeS subunit of a multidomain protein (F), an integral membrane protein (I), an
uncharacterised protein, a 1-haem cytochrome c and
another integral membrane protein. Cytochrome oxidase
of type A2 shows a very similar distribution to this
operon, being found in all negibacterial phyla (including
Cyanobacteria) except Sphingobacteria and Eurybacteria,
but in no known Unibacteria. A1 type cytochrome oxidases are present in Posibacteria and in the subphylum
Rhodobacteria of Proteobacteria. The MFIcc operon was
called 'recently "invented"' and it was asserted that organisms simultaneously possessing both the MFIcc operon
and cytochrome oxidase A2 were unrelated, and widespread lateral transfer was assumed [139]. As no explicit
reason was given for these very questionable suggestions,
it is unclear how they might have been reached, but they
are a likely example of incorrect conclusions derived from
the widespread but incorrect assumption that the root of
the tree lies outside negibacteria.

If those characters are mapped onto Figs 3 and 7 instead,
a radically different and much simpler conclusion is
apparent. The MFIcc operon is very ancient indeed, probably having been present in the cenancestor, but was lost
independently by the ancestral cyanobacterium and unibacterium. In addition it was lost on several occasions
within other phyla and secondarily truncated to an MFIc
operon in Deltabacteria. A2 cytochrome oxidase is the
ancestral state, and gene duplication in the common

Page 42 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

ancestor of Gracilicutes generated the A1 paralogue – the
A2 version was then lost by Thiobacteria and by the ancestral posibacterium (or its common ancestor with eurybacteria; data are needed for eurybacteria to decide), and
within Rhodobacteria. C and Q type oxidases may also
have evolved at the same time and been differentially lost.
Possibly no lateral transfers at all are needed.
At present the only chlorobacterium studied for electron
transfer complexes is Chloroflexus aurantiacum, which has
two c-type cytochromes (one single haem and one multihaem) and molybdopterin-related oxidoreductases in its
respiratory and (different paralogues) in its photosynthetic electron transport chains. The photosynthetic versions are encoded within an MFIcc operon and most of its
respiratory versions are in a second related but simplified
operon with several genes missing [139]. Detailed studies
of electron transport chains in numerous photosynthetic
and non-photosynthetic chlorobacteria are needed to test
whether cytochrome b is really entirely absent from all
Chlorobacteria, as tentatively suggested here, and to
understand these likely relics of the very early differentiation between respiratory and photosynthetic electron
transport. Many surprising discoveries may be made.
The chlorobacterial root of the universal tree
Figure 10 summarises the arguments that collectively
point to the universal root being within eobacteria, specifically beside or within Chlorobacteria, not between
archaebacteria and eubacteria as is widely supposed. Evidence for the evolution of proteasomes from HslV, not the
reverse, excludes the roots from proteates (neomura plus
actinomycetes – or a broader set of actinobacteria,
depending precisely on when proteasomes originated).
Since the archaebacterial/eubacterial boundary is within
proteates, the universal root cannot be between archaebacteria and eubacteria (the 'standard model': [15,16,19])
or between eukaryotes and prokaryotes (as supposed by
few [13]), or within eukaryotes or archaebacteria (both
occasionally proposed [140]) but must be within eubacteria. The two negibacteria-posibacteria polarisations independently confirm this, one based on wall and one on
flagellar evolution, whilst the Omp85 argument excludes
the root from all negibacteria except Chlorobacteria.
Complementarily but less decisively the gracilicute indels
exclude the root from the four-phylum gracilicute clade
and the flagellar origin argument excludes it from Posibacteria, Eurybacteria, Exoflagellata and Spirochaetes.
Thus a multiplicity of evidence excludes the root from all
parts of the tree except the putatively earliest diverging
eobacterial phyla: the Hadobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and
Chlorobacteria. The strong Omp85 argument excludes it
from everything except Chlorobacteria and nine other
important characters missing from Chlorobacteria corroborate their likely primitive status (Fig. 7). Several impor-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

tant characters indicate that Hadobacteria are more
primitive than any other phyla except Chlorobacteria.
Anyone wishing to retain the common assumption of a
root between neomura and eubacteria as suggested by the
first protein paralogue trees would have to disprove all
four of the major polarisations deduced from proteasome,
cell wall, and flagellar evolution, and suggest a superior
interpretation for the evolution of all these features. They
would also have to show that the fossil evidence that
eubacteria are at least a billion years older than eukaryotes
and/or all the evidence that archaebacteria are sisters not
ancestors of eukaryotes [1,129] have been fundamentally
misinterpreted.
A root within eubacteria has been least popular among
molecular evolutionists, yet is the only one strongly supported by palaeontology, as I repeatedly argued
[27,27,30,129,141]. I also stressed that the biosphere
depends fundamentally on photosynthetic carbon fixation, making it unlikely that large-scale evolution would
have progressed until it had evolved, so it probably did so
very early [30,31]. I pointed out that five of seven eubacterial phyla previously recognised (five of nine on Fig. 7)
contain members using bacteriochlorophyll or chlorophyll for photosynthesis, but each in a distinctively different way with contrasting antenna pigments and reaction
centres [30,31]; all those playing a significant role in carbon fixation are negibacteria. I proposed that this diversity arose during the very first major radiation of cells by
adaptation to spectrally changing light in successive layers
of the first microbial mats and that heterotrophs evolved
secondarily to exploit organics leaking from living or
dying phototrophs [30,31]. On that interpretation eubacteria are the only primary domain of life, neomura having
arisen very much later [30,31]. Proteasome, flagella,
murein wall, and outer membrane evolution now
strongly corroborate this. They show that posibacteria,
actinomycetes, and neomura all arose after the primary
radiation of life, probably all substantially later. In my
view the widespread assumption that archaebacteria are
among the most ancient life forms [19] is profoundly mistaken [1,129].
A root within eubacteria offers a simple perspective on the
pattern of protein fold superfamilies across the three
domains [119]. As eubacteria are the only primary
domain, and thus basal or paraphyletic, it is not in the
least surprising that they have no universally present
unique superfamilies not found in the other two secondarily derived domains (the surprise expressed in [119]
stems from the authors mistaken belief that eubacteria are
holophyletic); any superfamilies too important to be lost
within the eubacteria would have been retained by their
eukaryote and archaebacterial descendants. By contrast,
fundamentally important folds that originated during the

Simplified summary of the 10 major cellular transitions in the history of life. Those discussed and polarized previously [1, 27,
33] are shown by grey bars, while those discussed in detail here for the first time have blue bars; the five shown by thick bars
plus the origin of 20S proteasomes (within actinobacteria, so no bar) are especially decisively polarized; evolution in the
reverse direction would have been highly improbable, whereas for the four shown by narrow blue bars evolution in the
reverse direction would have been mechanistically possible but unparsimonious and have required numerous losses. Evolutionary loss has, however, sometimes played a crucial role, as in the origins of posibacteria and of neomura by the loss of the OM
and murein wall respectively.

The fundamental changes involving murein peptidoglycan are shown in brown. NPC = nuclear pore complexes, several proteins of which

eukaryotes [199]. The dotted line from Gracilicutes to mitochondrion signifies the intracellular enslavement of a probably photosynthetic purple bacterium by a protoeukaryote to make the chimaeric eukaryote cell [33, 129], which must have taken place
long after the origin of proteobacteria, even longer after the origin of Gracilicutes and eubacteria, but probably only shortly
after the neomuran revolution and bifurcation into archaebacteria (the youngest of all bacterial phyla) and the preeukaryote.

neomuran revolution would be found in all neomura and
no eubacteria. Likewise, those that originated during the
somewhat later origin or either eukaryotes or archaebacte-

ria would necessarily be restricted to these derived groups
and could not have been passed on to another domain by
vertical inheritance. Given the eubacterial root, we can

readily see that there were probably only two major bursts
of invention of protein folds in the history of life: the origin of many hundreds during the origin of the eubacterial
cell and a major addition of novel folds during the origin
of eukaryotes [119]. Only one universal archaebacteriaspecific fold was invented; the protein that makes the
novel archaebacterial base archaeosine, one of very few
archaebacteria-specific characters [1]. Thus, in terms of
novel protein invention, the origin of archaebacteria was
a relatively trivial evolutionary event compared with the
origin of eukaryotes, consistent with archaebacteria being
the most recent bacterial phylum that evolved billions of
years after the major burst of prokaryotic protein innovation occurred. It appears, however, that the ancestor of
archaebacteria lost hundreds of fold superfamilies after it
diverged from the stem lineage leading to eukaryotes.
Thus loss played a much bigger role than innovation in
the origin of archaebacteria. In terms of major innovations of protein structure, as well as in cell structure and
cell biology, the dichotomy between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes is immensely more important than that
between eubacteria and archaebacteria. Ribosomal and
DNA-handling proteins underwent episodic accelerated
evolution during the neomuran revolution, as did rRNA
[1], giving the impression on sequence trees that archaebacteria are much more distant from eubacteria than the
vast majority of proteins indicates to be the case. These
minority proteins and rRNAs thus exaggerate the evolutionary distinctiveness of archaebacteria, which are simply
derived, partially degenerate bacteria with novel lipids,
flagella and tRNA modifications, and ancestrally greatly
reduced genomes and proteomes compared with most
eubacteria. It is profoundly misleading to call them a third
form of life distinct from prokaryotes and eukaryotes or to
consider them as ancient.
Protein fold superfamily trees can clearly be biased by
massive convergent protein losses; although some correction for this can be made [119], it is not to be expected
that they will reconstruct the actual phylogeny perfectly
using present methods. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that
with the notable exception of spirochaetes, for which
there is ample other evidence for monophyly, most of the
10 bacterial phyla recognized here appear to be monophyletic or nearly so (including Posibacteria, which is
more nearly monophyletic than is Proteobacteria) on the
corrected fold superfamily trees [119]. It would be desirable to add data also for Chlorobacteria, the only prokaryote phylum not included, and to carry out a higher
resolution cladistic analysis within eubacteria to map
superfold innovations and losses in detail across the nine
eubacterial phyla to test the tree topology proposed here.
Although subject to biases, the fact that Aquifex is correctly
grouped with the Proteobacteria and Thermotoga correctly
lies within the unresolved Endobacteria/Eurybacteria

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

branch and that these two hyperthermophiles do not
group together, as they often do on sequence trees, is consistent their grouping on many sequence trees probably
being a tree reconstruction artefact. It would be particularly interesting to know how many of the 68 non-universal 68 fold superfamilies are absent from Chlorobacteria
and at what point on the tree each of them arose. This
would enable a complete enumeration of the fold superfamilies present in the cenancestor, likely to be over a
thousand.
My present interpretation of eubacterial evolution and
rooting of the whole tree is broadly similar to the earlier
one [1] but is far stronger in being based on the new
eubacterial polarisations shown in Figs 3 and 7, in addition to the detailed neomuran, eukaryote, and archaebacterial origin analyses discussed previously. It also differs in
three key respects, each important for the relative timing
of early cell evolutionary events. Because of the 12
synapomorphies shared by Hadobacteria and more
derived cells (Fig. 3, 8), I now place the root between
Chlorobacteria and all other life, or possibly within Chlorobacteria, not between eobacteria and all other life as
before [1]. Secondly, I now place cyanobacteria below the
gracilicute/eurybacterial divergence, and argue that they
are primitively without flagella, not secondarily so [1].
Thirdly, I accept Eurybacteria as definite negibacteria,
which places the origin of posibacteria substantially later
in evolution than the major glycobacterial radiation of
photosynthetic phyla.
Testing the chlorobacterial rooting
It is a mistake to think that sequence trees are the only way
of testing phylogenetic history. Nonetheless, they are
important. Several features of the universal tree presented
here, especially the relationships among eurybacteria,
should be tested by taxonomically much more extensive
gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of scores of
the most conservative genes (with proper controls against
lateral gene transfer) using methods best adapted to
avoiding those systematic biases that can make it increasingly likely that you will get the wrong tree with high confidence as more genes are added.

However, the best form of testing is to search for other
equally strong cladistic characters amenable to decisive
transition analysis to see whether they are congruent with
or contradict the present rooting. Finding additional characters of this sort is also likely to be the most secure way
of deciding whether the root lies within chlorobacteria or
beside them. I cannot predict what such unrecognised
characters might be, for if I already knew I should have
used them in this paper to finally pinpoint the root. But
we should expect there to be a number of important characters that in principle might corroborate or refute some

Page 45 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

of the polarisations that I have made. Obviously, in my
previous paper, primarily devoted to the neomuran revolution [1], I missed all those shown in red on Fig. 3 and
that were discussed above for the first time. This should
stimulate researchers to seek other characters that can be
of value, and not falsely to claim that the present conclusions are untestable, should they disagree with them.
The most important kind of characters involves at least
several interacting proteins that have undergone very few
major transitions in the entire tree. With such characters it
is sometimes possible unambiguously to polarise transitions, as I have shown here, so I emphasized them most in
the first part of this paper. Indels, gene fusions and presence of absence of particular genes can also be valuable in
helping to group taxa together but they risk confusion by
multiple losses and lateral transfer. Although the latter
can often be detected by sequence phylogeny, it can be
notoriously difficult to rule out simple tree reconstruction
artefacts, especially in sparsely sampled trees, and some
probably overpower even the best methods currently
available. Individual gene characters can also seldom be
used on their own to polarise transitions. One that did, in
conjunction with paralogue trees, is the insertion in the
catalytic subunit of neomuran vacuolar ATPase, which
demonstrate that the ancestral state for that molecule is
the eubacterial version, whilst the neomuran one must be
derived [1,116]. A similar argument can be used to support the derived nature of the gracilicute RNA polymerase
insertions discussed above.
A second good way of testing the conclusions is by more
intensive fundamental and comparative study of the very
molecules of the individual macromolecular complexes
on which the transition analyses depend. Especially
important is analysis of protein diversity in the OM of
chlorobacteria and the methods they use for targeting and
assembling protein complexes, and the phylogenetic history of the molecules involved. Such studies will provide
the hard information necessary to assess critically the
validity of the Omp85-based polarisation, and are thus of
crucial significance. They could either strengthen or
weaken my arguments, or lead to worthwhile improvements in them.
Given the evolutionary importance of Eurybacteria as
probable ancestors of Posibacteria, and of Chlorobacteria
as being probably the most primitive of all cells, both
phyla ought to receive the extensive and intensive study
by molecular, cell, and evolutionary biologists that
archaebacteria did in response to the stimulating, but partially incorrect, three domains of life theory. Sequencing
complete genomes of numerous phyletically diverse
Chlorobacteria would provide essential information for
testing and refining the present analysis and pinpointing

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

the root of the universal tree precisely, so that we can then
work more confidently backwards to deduce how life
itself began.
Ecological considerations
If Endobacteria rather than Chlorobacteria were the most
ancient group [79], they could not have sustained an ecosystem by themselves, as all are heterotrophs. No Posibacteria could do that, as none can photosynthesize or carry
out net carbon fixation. No unibacteria can carry out photosynthetic carbon fixation. Putting the root between
neomura and eubacteria as suggested by a biased subset of
paired paralogue trees [15,16] implies the ecological
impossibility of a heterotrophic ancestor generating an
ecosystem in which posibacterial heterotrophs could
diversify sufficiently eventually to evolve into the first negibacterium (despite the mechanistic near impossibility of
that discussed above), and only then evolve chlorophyll
and photosynthesis. That ecological absurdity is implicit
in the widespread, but deeply mistaken, acceptance of that
position for the root. If early ecosystems were based on
photosynthetic fixation of carbon dioxide they were
almost certainly primarily, and probably exclusively, negibacterial. Thus, as previously stressed [142], ecology provides an important argument for polarizing the tree from
negibacteria to unibacteria, not the reverse.

Chemolithotrophy in its various forms (including methanogenesis) is likely to be multiply derived rather than the
ancestral class of nutrition, irrespective of whether the
root is placed beside or within chlorobacteria or between
neomura and eubacteria. Being limited by restricted availability of reduced inorganic electron donors none could
support an ecosystem on the scale possible with phototrophy. On my present interpretation most forms of chemolithotrophy evolved only after the origin of
Proteobacteria, with archaebacterial methanogens being
immensely later [129].
Only Chlorobacteria, Eurybacteria, Sphingobacteria, and
Proteobacteria have a mix of photoautotrophs and heterotrophs, making them ecologically plausible candidates
for the first phylum (though modern Eurybacteria use
sunlight only for energy, they fix nitrogen but CO2). When
I first agued that cells must originally have been photosynthetic negibacteria [58], I initially favoured non-flagellate
anaerobic green bacteria as the ancestral cells on account
of their relatively simple photosynthesis [1], and later,
after learning that of these Chlorobacteria alone also
lacked lipopolysaccharide, I argued that they were the best
candidates [1,142]. Now the root is excluded from all of
them except Chlorobacteria by the Omp85 and flagellar
arguments, which is also strongly favoured by the much
lower OM complexity generally than in any glycobacteria.
Surface waters, where proteobacterial exoflagella and pho-

totaxis are especially useful, were probably largely closed
to life by UV radiation before cyanobacteria created the
protective ozone layer, as was shallow soil, where Posibacteria dominate by having thick walls and drought-resistant spores. Consequences of these innovations for
biogeochemical cycles, isotopic fractionation, and climate
are discussed elsewhere [129].
Very early life was probably deep benthic with non-flagellate Chlorobacteria and Cyanobacteria dominant. It is
thus ecologically as well as mechanistically simpler for the
first cells to have been non-motile; soon they evolved gliding to escape burial by sediment and position themselves
optimally within the mat. Flagella might have evolved
only after atmospheric oxygenation created an ozone
layer, permitting individual cells – especially purple bacteria – to swim and photosynthesize in the upper pelagic
zone, and then spirochaete endoflagella evolved to allow
these secondary heterotrophs to corkscrew through soft
mats. Chlorobacterial gliding needs investigation for possible homology to cyanobacterial slime secretion by junctional pore complexes, conceivably an ancestral gliding
mechanism, or to type IV pilus-based gliding – or both.
If the root of the universal tree does indeed lie either
beside or within Chlorobacteria, it is likely but not certain
that the cenancestor was photosynthetic. If, as seems most
likely, the root is between Chlorobacteria and all other
organisms rather than within them, the cenancestor was
definitely photosynthetic (discounting later lateral transfer of photosynthetic genes, not rigorously demonstrated
[143], and an unnecessary complication as the next section explains for the pigment biosynthesis genes: Fig. 9
interpreted their probable vertical evolution cladistically).
It is very important to culture strains and sequence
genomes from the most deeply diverging chlorobacterial
lineages, as this might establish their ancestral phenotype.
This plus cladistic/transition analysis should help decide
whether Chlorobacteria are holophyletic sisters of all
other organisms (Figs 3, 7) or their ancestors, and enable
a still more rigorous reconstruction of the last common
ancestor of all life. It has been suggested that Dehalococcoides had an autotrophic ancestor [121]. Ancestral Chlorobacteria and the last common ancestor of all life were
most likely photoheterotrophs [31].
Although I have sometimes thought that the non-CO2 fixing photoheterotrophy of Heliobacteria and their apparently simple photosynthetic machinery of Heliobacteria
might have been primitive, the robust polarization of
numerous other characters (Fig. 3, 7) is incongruent with
such a view, so we must now conclude that their apparently simple photosystem is not primitive but the result of
radical evolutionary simplification (Fig. 9), as must also
be the loss of photosynthetic carbon fixation – presuma-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

bly a secondary adaptation to a niche with abundant
organic material provided ultimately by other photosynthetic phyla, and thus a need to rely on light only for
energy. This clarification of the specialised derived status
of heliobacteria emphasises the importance of analysing
numerous independent cell characters in order to root the
tree and not to attempt to distinguish between apparently
simple characters that are genuinely primitive and those
that are derived merely by studying one system in isolation, whether that be ribosomes, photosynthesis, flagella,
wall and OM biosynthesis, OM protein-targeting, secretion systems, or proteolysis. All were needed to reach the
present decisive conclusion. It is decisive because only
one root position is congruent with them all.
Evolution of nitrogen fixation
As an example of the profoundly different and much simpler conclusions that the present rooting of the tree can
lead to, I shall conclude by considering the evolution of
nitrogen fixation, which had major ecological and biogeochemical importance. It is accepted that both multiprotein reductase components of nitrogenase are
evolutionarily related to the two major components of the
enzymes that carry out key reductions of the photosynthetic pigment precursors protochlorophyllide and chlorophyllide [114]. Recently two alternative elaborate
interpretations involving numerous hypothetical lateral
gene transfers were put forward based on the erroneous
assumption that the root lies between neomura and
eubacteria [114]. Both assumed that the Nif genes responsible for nitrogen fixation evolved before protochlorophyllide and chlorophyllide reductases and that pigment
biosynthesis evolved from them. It was not explained how
nitrogen fixation and extensive cellular evolution was possible in the absence of photosynthesis, but implied that
ecosystems may originally have been based on methanogenesis. One scenario assumed that nitrogen fixation
evolved in the last common ancestor of all life, and the
other assumed that it arose in methanogens and was
transferred to eubacteria prior to the origin of chlorophylls.

A phylogenetically much simpler and evolutionarily and
ecologically far more plausible interpretation is that group
II Nif genes evolved from the pigment biosynthesis genes
in the bacterial cenancestor but that group I Nif genes
arose only during the glycobacterial revolution after the
origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, and that inheritance
has been almost exclusively vertical (Fig. 7). Nif genes are
absent from Hadobacteria. Although they were not previously found in Chlorobacteria [104], I found two NifD
homologues by BLAST in the thermophilic non-photosynthetic chlorobacterium Dehalococcoides (one hits Chlorobiales much more strongly than any other groups, E
value e-86 and another does so with e-58) and one in the

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

mesophilic photosynthetic chlorobacterium Oscillochloris,
which has recently been shown also to have NifH [144].
As these chlorobacterial Nif genes seem all to be of the
anaerobically adapted group II type found also in green
sulphur bacteria, I suggest that this putatively ancestral
type evolved from either protochlorophyllide or chlorophyllide reductase by duplicating a pigment synthesis
operon, marked divergence to allow attachment of an
FeMo cofactor, and subsequent additional duplications.
Later during the glycobacterial revolution the rise in oxygen levels made an ability to reduce nitrogen in its presence important, which required a new type of nitrogenase,
type I, characteristic of cyanobacteria and proteobacteria,
which I suggest arose in a rapid burst of evolution (quantum evolution: [1,129]) to become the ancestor of group
I nitrogenases. I suggest that the group I Nif operon, which
contains several paralogous genes, arose in the aerobic
common ancestor of cyanobacteria and gracilicutes with
at least some means of separating it from oxygen. When
the ancestor of green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiales)
became anaerobic after core gracilicutes diverged to yield
proteobacteria and Sphingobacteria, it retained the group
II enzyme but lost the group I enzyme, whereas the ancestrally facultatively aerobic Proteobacteria lost the group II
enzyme and retained the new aerobic group I enzyme
instead. Much later still a group II enzyme was laterally
transferred from a green sulphur bacterium (precisely as
suggested previously: [104]) to the common ancestor of
the archaebacterial Methanosarcinales (a group known to
have acquired many eubacterial genes [41]). My interpretation requires no other lateral transfer events, but
assumes that nitrogen fixation was lost by the neomuran
common ancestor and frequently within phyla that have
it. Raymond et al. [114] pointed out evidence for such loss
in Fusobacterium, which has four Nif homologues but does
not fix nitrogen, and also remarked that 'the individual
genes composing the core HDKEN operon have remarkably similar phylogenetic histories despite instances of
gene duplication, rearrangement, and loss apparent in the
records of multiple genomes.' This indicates that lateral
gene transfer has been much rarer for nif genes than traditionally assumed. With the correct rooting in eobacteria
even fewer need be postulated than they supposed.
I further suggest that type III Mo-independent nitrogenases, present only in Proteobacteria and the archaebacterial Methanosarcinales evolved only later – well after
flagella in Proteobacteria, when their more mobile cells
were more likely to colonise Mo-poor habitats. By contrast Raymond et al. suggested that although some Moindependent nitrogenase evolved recently thus, the main
group III clade might be more ancient, but recognised that
if that were so 'what remains enigmatic is why all alternative nitrogenases studied so far are found only in organisms that also have Mo-dependent enzymes'. Accepting

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

the chlorobacterial root, and the highly derived nature of
type III nitrogenase also simply solves the enigma and
also does not require that nitrogenase implausibly
evolved at the beginning of life as in their first scenario,
and reduces the number of lateral gene transfer events; in
contrast to [114] none need be implausibly postulated
into groups that already have Nif genes.
I also differ in my interpretation of the so-called 'group IV'
Nif-related proteins, which appeared as non-holophyletic
long branches on their trees [114], and which typically are
not part of a Nif operon, and are functionally uncharacterised; there is no evidence that they are involved in nitrogen fixation. I suggest that the simplest interpretation of
these is that they are all secondarily derived from Nif I-III
proteins by loss of nitrogenase function and with the
acquisition of a novel (still unknown) function that
allows them to evolve much faster than their Nif ancestors
or those involved in pigment synthesis. Their very long
branches should not be interpreted as evidence for great
antiquity, as suggested previously, but as rapid evolution
following a loss of their original function. Raymond et al.
[114] suggested that very explanation for the Fusobacterium protein. I suggest that it is probably true of all of
them. The shift of function need not have occurred once
only; it could have occurred independently in Proteobacteria, Eurybacteria/Endobacteria and Methanosarcinales,
their deep positions on the tree simply being an artefact of
exclusion of these sequences from their far shorter-branch
ancestral clades. Thus I suspect that they are not a natural
group, but polyphyletic derivatives of the three main Nif
clades. This is very strongly supported by the fact that the
proteobacterial representatives in 'group IV' have manyfold longer branches than do proteobacterial group I
enzymes; they must have evolved many times faster
within the very same cell lineages.
Similar long-branch artefacts, I suggest, account for the
relative positions of groups I-III on the tree. Quantum
evolution postulated above at the base of the group II
clade followed by a systematically higher rate of change in
the enzymes of these anaerobes would also lead to longbranch exclusion from the group I branch, which I argue
is probably not a clade but really paraphyletic. I suggest
that substitution of iron or vanadium for molybdenum to
form the group III enzymes (probably independently
[114]) can also accelerate evolution and cause similar
long-branch exclusion. I feel unsure whether the grouping
of the archaebacterial sequences with the proteobacterial
group III enzymes is genuine or another long-branch artefact. If that relationship is genuine, it implies a lateral gene
transfer from proteobacteria to Methanosarcinales, independently of that from Chlorobiales. Although not
impossible, given the evidence that this archaebacterial
group acquired hundreds of genes from eubacteria [41], it

Page 48 of 83

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

is not obviously correct. They may instead be much faster
evolving paralogues that evolved within Methanosarcinales from the group II genes originally acquired from
Chlorobiales and therefore be wrongly placed on the tree.
The Nif tree further illustrates the severe hazards of interpreting paralogue trees when major shifts in function dramatically change evolutionary rates. Consider now the
pigment synthesis paralogues. It would be absurd to suppose that their evolution has been even remotely clocklike since the protochlorophyllide or chlorophyllide
reductase diverged from a common ancestor. The depth of
the whole clade is about six times that of its cyanobacterial part. Given that cyanobacteria must have evolved at
least 2.2 Gy ago, as shown both by the morphological fossil record and the timing of the great oxygenation event
[129,134], assuming a clock would place the time of
divergence of those genes as ~13.2 Gy, nearly three times
the age of the earth, and somewhat older than the universe. Clearly the rate of evolution of these two paralogues
must have been immensely greater soon after they
diverged and slowed down dramatically by the time
cyanobacteria evolved. The fundamental problem that
makes such protein paralogues worse than useless for
rooting trees [1] is superbly illustrated by this pigment
reductase tree. Each will be such a long branch outgroup
that it will give an entirely artifactual mid-point rooting to
each tree. We cannot therefore conclude that the root is
where they show it to be.
I hope that I have convinced the reader that the root
should be on the branch from Chloroflexus to the rest of
eubacteria on both the protochlorophyllide and chlorophyllide reductase subtrees. Yet both put it between the
two green bacterial phyla with chlorosomes and proteobacteria. In the past this has been misinterpreted as evidence for lateral gene transfer between the green bacteria.
It is not. It is just a bad tree, dimensionally hugely distorted by quantum evolution and misrooted by paralogue
rooting that is necessarily misled by gross long-branch
artefacts. If, as argued here and previously [1], the bacteriochlorophylls used by chlorosomes are the ancestral state,
the closer grouping of the Chlorobium and Chloroflexus
enzymes merely reflects a slower rate of evolution and the
lack of any special acceleration because the pigment type
was essentially unchanged. I argue that when cyanobacteria evolved chlorophylls instead of bacteriochlorophyll,
and lost chlorosomes, there was another transient large
change to the reductase enzyme, a temporary massive rate
acceleration that artifactually stretched the stems of the
tree that separate cyanobacteria from both groups of green
bacteria. Likewise, when later proteobacteria lost chlorosomes and evolved a new set of bacteriochlorophylls,
quantum evolution of this enzyme occurred yet again.
Thus the degree of separation of the major branches on

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

the two reductase subtrees mainly reflects the change in
function for making different pigments billions of years
ago rather than the relatively slight divergences that have
occurred since. This paralogue tree is profoundly nonclock-like, like all those that appear to support a rooting
between neomura and thus profoundly misleading about
the relative timing of evolutionary events unless it is very
critically interpreted in the light of independent evidence,
which must now become the norm for all paralogue trees.
The long internal stems that separate them from the Nif
proteins likewise reflect rapid quantum evolution during
the origin of nitrogen fixation, and do not accurately indicate elapsed time; by the same argument as above, applying a simple clock to Nif half of the tree would give an
absurd separation between Nifs and pigment reductases
before the universe began. Molecules can only be semiclock like in their evolution when there is little or no significant change of function – and often not even then,
especially if disparate lineages are compared.
Broader implications of the chlorobacterial root of the
tree
All polarizations of evolutionary change discussed above
are congruent with the root being between Chlorobacteria
and all other organisms (Figs 3, 7) or within Chlorobacteria. Here and previously [1,28] I have given reasons why
any other position is contradicted by 1–10 of the more
decisive polarizations shown in Fig. 7; the popular idea of
a root between neomura and eubacteria is strongly contradicted by three of them. I conclude that the last ancestor
of all life was a non-flagellate, non-spore-forming, eubacterium with acyl-ester membrane lipids, a murein peptidoglycan wall, and fully developed eubacterial molecular
biology and cell division mechanisms. It was a negibacterium with two membranes, the OM being attached to
murein by lipoproteins, not a unibacterium with one, nor
a primitive incompetent progenote; however, its cell envelope was probably distinctly simpler in many respects
than those of glycobacteria, the best known, but more
advanced negibacteria. We cannot confidently say if it was
a heterotroph or a phototroph, but photoheterotrophy
with separately differentiated respiratory and photosynthetic chains as in Chloroflexus is most likely – unless the
root is within Chlorobacteria on a purely non-photosynthetic branch.

Previous literature statements about 'early branching
eubacteria' are virtually all suspect, especially for Aquifex,
clearly a thiobacterial proteobacterium seriously misplaced on rRNA and some other trees, and probably also
wrong for the eurybacterium Thermotoga. Probably only
Chlorobacteria are early diverging, though Hadobacteria
might be nearly as old. The conventional view that the
first cell had one membrane only is merely an assumption
that has never been justified by careful phylogenetic argu-

ments; the assumption that the universal root lies within
Posibacteria [73] derives solely from an argument based
on the supposedly shared absence in Posibacteria of a segment of Hsp70 and its ancient paralogue MREB; however,
more accurate alignment of this region shows that these
missing regions only partially overlap, making it likely
that a secondary deletion occurred in Hsp70 of Posibacteria [145]; if so, this deletion is a synapomorphy for Posibacteria and further evidence for their being derived, not
the ancestral state; moreover, as Hsp70 and MREB are sisters, the assumption that the segment missing in MREB
was absent in their common ancestor is arbitrary and no
help in rooting the tree. The most widespread assumption
that the root is between archaebacteria and eubacteria
[19] is based purely on a handful of information-poor single-gene paralogue trees [15,16], all technically flawed
[1,2,116], and is contradicted by a combination of the fossil record and molecular cladistic evidence for the holophyly of archaebacteria and a direct relationship between
neomura and actinobacteria [1], and by several of the 13
novel transition analyses discussed here.
By contrast, the chlorobacterial root of the tree is consistent with the fossil record and strongly supported by transition analysis of many key characters and by congruence
testing – including, of course, compatibility with
sequence trees, provided that their potentially misleading
quirks are critically taken into account, as in the examples
discussed here. It gives a radically new and more confident
perspective to molecular and cell evolution. Interpretations based on the so-called 'standard model' of a primary
split for life between archaebacteria and eubacteria [19]
were based on an incredibly narrow line of evidence, now
shown to be fundamentally flawed, and need radical revision. Assumed lateral gene transfers and the fossil record
both need critical reinterpretation in light of the new and
more secure rooting, as illustrated above for the Nif proteins, and previously for isoprenoid synthesis enzymes
[1].
Life probably began between about 3 and 3.5 Gy ago, with
the earlier date more likely if the stromatolites, filamentous putative fossils and light carbon isotope levels in that
period are mostly biogenic. Biomarkers dating from 2.8
Gy and carbon and sulphur isotopic changes between 3
and 2.4 billion years ago and the evidence for consistently
increased oxygen levels since 2.45 Gy ago [134,146-150],
are consistent with the view that cyanobacteria and all the
other negibacterial phyla and proteobacterial biological
sulphate reduction had already come into existence by 2.4
Gy ago. I suggest that the sudden negibacterial radiation
seen on all molecular trees represents a genuinely rapid
radiation of photosynthetic bacteria and secondary heterotrophs around 2.8–3.0 Gy ago: i.e. the origin of all negibacterial phyla except chlorobacteria, which are likely to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

be somewhat older – a glycobacterial big bang triggered
by the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis associated with
photosystem duplication in the common ancestor of glycobacteria and hadobacteria, as argued above. All transitions between negibacterial phyla involved phototrophs
as the ancestral state. It is unlikely that oxygenic photosynthesis originated before 2.9 Gy ago given the evidence
from mass independent sulphur isotope fraction in the
much of the Archaean [149,151]. Therefore the filamentous putative fossils of the period 3–3.5 Gy ago [152-155]
would be more likely to be chlorobacteria than cyanobacteria [37] (if they are indeed biogenic, which is nonproven but reasonably plausible for some [37,155],
despite serious criticisms of the earliest examples
[156,157]).
As Endobacteria are nested within Eurybacteria, the origin
of the purely heterotrophic Posibacteria probably significantly post-dated the major negibacterial big bang radiation; they are unlikely to be much older than two billion
years; if Endobacteria are paraphyletic actinobacteria
could be still younger. I suspect that some of the largest
most complex microfossils that first appear nearly 1.5 Gy
ago may be actinomycetes rather than stem eukaryotes,
for, in my view, none of their morphological features
require either a cytoskeleton or an endomembrane system
for their formation, contrary to assertions that they do
[158] – there is no reason to place them within any
known eukaryote group. If the major 'big bang radiation'
of eukaryotes [27] was later than sometimes supposed
(perhaps only 800–1100 My ago [1,34,129]), and archaebacteria are really their sisters [1], archaebacteria cannot
be much older, making it invalid to invoke their biogenic
methane as greenhouse gas to solve the faint early sun
problem and prevent Archaean global freezing [147,148].
Alternative explanations [159] are possible for the light
carbon isotopes around 2.8 Gy often attributed to methanogenesis plus methylotrophy [160,161]. In a parallel
more detailed discussion of the fossil record in the light of
the new rooting of the tree argued here I explain how this
light-isotopic signal could have been produced simply by
eubacteria in stratified microbial mats without any participation from methanogens [129]; these isotopic data are
not specific evidence for methanogens and thus do not
contradict the late origin of archaebacteria, contrary to
widespread assumptions.
Perhaps the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis about 2.9
Gy ago, just before the origin of cyanobacteria (>2.8 Gy
based on hopanoid biomarkers [162]), oxidized such abiotically generated methane as may have been present in
the early Archaean atmosphere (no basis yet exists for
assessing its likely level) and caused the world's first glaciation (2.9 Gy ago [163]) and the burgeoning of cyanobacteria 2.5–2.7 Gy ago depleted an ancient protective CO2

blanket [164] by carbon fixation enough to trigger the 10
My global freeze-up ~2.4 Gy ago [165]. Recovery from
such global glaciation was also probably slow because it
required accumulation of very high CO2 levels [166].
Earth probably approached its modern quasi-steady state
only after the burgeoning of cyanobacteria when the burial of fixed carbon and oxidation of sulphur and iron minerals by biogenic oxygen reached a quasi steady state
during the great oxygenation event of the atmosphere and
surface rocks 2.0–2.45 Gy ago [134,147]. If archaebacterial methanogenesis originated soon after 800 My ago [1],
the first major pulse of biogenic methane could have been
climatically very destabilizing before methanotrophy
originated; a sudden major new source of this greenhouse
gas, 21 times more powerful in trapping heat than CO2,
might have triggered the Neoproterozoic snowball earth
episodes ~710 and ~635 My ago [167] by causing sudden
global warming, thus inducing climatic oscillation into
near global ice-ages, that would eventually have settled
down after methanogenesis and methanotrophy became
quantitatively balanced; see [129] for details and references. On this view both major global snowball earth episodes in the history of our planet could have been caused
indirectly by the origin of new types of bacterial physiology. Life before and after this second huge climatic destabilization remained rather simple and little changed
[168], with eukaryotes unambiguously identifiable to
modern phyla emerging only in the very late Neoproterozoic shortly before the Cambrian explosion of both animals and protists [1,169]. It is likely that this late
eukaryotic explosion of life was primarily prevented earlier by the difficulty and thus lateness of the complex transition from bacteria to the eukaryotic cell [27,29,56] and
especially of its prerequisite, the probably immediately
preceding neomuran revolution [129], but sustained evolution of greater complexity may also have required the
greater climatic and ecological stability that set in after
about 600 My ago because all major forms of bacterial
metabolism had already evolved and their bearers multiplied into a trophic quasi-steady state. More accurately
dating the onset of each type of metabolism by better integration of palaeontological and molecular evidence [146],
will enable such far-reaching interpretations to be tested
more thoroughly.
Lipid substitution in bacterial membrane evolution
At the request of a referee I introduced this and the following two sections to comment of some of the misconceptions in a recent paper by Koonin and Martin [170], some
of which are more widely held and thus merit refutation
in detail. That paper slightly extends Martin and Russell's
earlier one [108] that combined Russell's interesting ideas
on precellular chemistry before the origin of life with the
fallacious widespread assumption that the root of the tree
is between neomura and eubacteria, which the present

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

paper refutes in detail, plus the also ill-founded suggestion that lipid membranes evolved independently in
neomura and eubacteria [109]. Koonin and Martin [170]
criticize the view that eubacteria are ancestral to archaebacteria [1,5,29,79,81,129] because it entails the substitution of acyl ester lipids by isoprenoid ether lipids in the
ancestor of archaebacteria. They object to this because
they claim 'no known prokaryotes have undergone any
vaguely similar cataclysmic lipid transition'. But 'cataclysmic' is tendentious and question begging. Their own scenario necessarily entails precisely the opposite transition:
from isoprenoid ethers in the supposed archaebacterial
ancestor of eukaryotes by acyl esters supplied by the proteobacterium enslaved as a mitochondrion. They do not
attempt to explain why the transition would be less cataclysmic in that direction, or provide any reason why a cell
could not survive a replacement of acyl esters by isoprenoid ethers.
More fundamentally, setting aside the emotive 'cataclysmic', is it actually true that no prokaryote has ever 'undergone any vaguely similar lipid transition'? Of course not.
As discussed above, several evolutionary replacements of
the lipids of outer leaflet of the negibacterial OM are well
documented. First was the replacement of ordinary phospholipids by LPS in the ancestral glycobacteria; later this
was replaced in Sphingomonas and six related genera of αproteobacteria (and independently by most spirochaetes)
by glycosphingolipid (D-glucuronosylceramide), and still
later by phosphatidyl choline independently in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Clearly they are at least 'vaguely
similar' cases of lipid substitution. Even had their assertion been true, it would have been an evolutionarily naïve
and illogical objection. One cannot reasonably argue
against the occurrence of a unique evolutionary transition, such as the origin of feathers or the replacement of
acyl esters by isoprenoid ethers on the grounds that it
never occurred elsewhere! There is no fundamental mechanistic difficulty in lipid replacement if the transitional
stages had both lipid types and gradual adaptation
occurred. There are many cases where eubacteria have
supplemented their phospholipids by other kinds and
have mixed membrane composition, e.g. by sphingolipids in many sphingobacteria and ether-linked glycerolipids in many eubacterial hyperthermophiles, e.g. Aquifex,
Ammonifex and Thermodesulfobacterium [171]. The
repeated independent evolution of ether lipids in hyperthermophiles strongly supports the thesis that such bonds
are a specific adaptation to hyperthermophily and hot
acid [1,30] in the ancestral archaebacterium. I argued that
those lipids were ancestrally tetraethers spanning the
whole bilayer, and stressed that as posibacteria can
already make isoprenoids [1] and have the enzyme glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase that makes the sn-1glycerol phosphate backbone to which they are added in

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

archaebacteria [18], that the origin of such lipids by an
actinobacterial derivative was mechanistically and phylogenetically highly plausible. The only additional step was
the loss of the acyl esters, also perfectly plausible. Thus the
precursors were all present in the actinobacterial ancestor
and the selective advantage of the replacement is very
clear in that direction not the reverse. I have never seen a
refutation of these arguments from Martin or anyone.
The gulf between archaebacterial and eubacterial lipids is
also made less by the discovery that membrane spanning
tetraether dialkyl glycerol lipids are abundant in peat
[171]; if they are made by eubacteria, as suggested by their
sn-3-glycerophosphate stereochemistry [171], this would
mean that some eubacteria evolved tetraether lipids independently of archaebacteria. If instead they are made by
archaebacteria, this would show that some archaebacteria
can make syn-1,2 alkyl glycerolipids like eubacteria.
Change in membrane lipid composition is not as difficult
as Koonin and Martin claim.
They also fail to address the similarities in eubacterial
murein peptidoglycan biosynthesis and neomuran Nlinked glycoprotein biosynthesis, with respect to the key
involvement of N-acetylglucosamine and the transport of
hydrophilic precursors across the cytoplasmic membrane
by a long chain isoprenol (dolichol or undecaprenol
respectively) to which I drew attention in 1957 when proposing the neomuran theory [29]. The latter in particular
as emphasized above implies that the eubacterium/
neomuran transition took place in a cell with complex
cytoplasmic membrane and ability to make both long
chain isoprenols and N-acetyl glucosamine. Treating that
transition as being precellular [108,109,170,172,173] is
cell biologically absurd. It is also unsound from the point
of view of protein evolution; 683 protein fold superfamilies are shared by eubacteria and archaebacteria
[119]; probably most of these were present in the transitional organism, making it proteomically far too complex
a cell not to have had a DNA genome, contrary to their
unsound assumption [170].
They attempted to meet the criticism that the cenancestor
must have had a lipid membrane to explain the universal
presence of homologous SRP mechanisms and proton
pumping ATPases in cells [18] by suggesting for the first
time that their hypothetical inorganic walled intermediate
between neomura and eubacteria also had lipid membranes of fatty acids made prebiotically, not biosynthetically [170]. While it is nice that they are beginning to
concede the importance of lipids, this has every appearance of a desperate attempt to save a totally untenable
hypothesis from fatal criticism, rather than a well-thought
out theory. They do not hazard a guess as to the function
or selective advantage of such early membranes. Nor do

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

they cite or refute my arguments that membranes must
have played a key role in the origin of organismal complexity, in association with genes and catalysts, by providing a supragenic unit capable of inheritance and variation
on which selection could act [31]. They seem not to
understand in the slightest the required nature of such an
organismal entity. It must be able to vary in its rate of
growth and multiplication and the associated genes must
influence these properties heritably.
Cells, not genes, are the key units of selection and heredity
Although Koonin and Martin [170] call their compartments discrete units, they are not shown thus on their diagrams, but are joined in a network – the opposite of
discreteness. They suggest that new ones are formed by
'precipitation at the ocean interface'. Thus it seems that
old compartments do not grow or divide or generate new
ones directly. Thus they are NOT units of multiplication
on which selection might act and are not units of heredity,
unlike cells or the membranous obcells that I argue preceded and created negibacterial cells [31]. What phenotypes do compartments have and how could they be
improved? Calling them 'discrete units' is meaningless
verbalism irrelevant to the need to have discrete supramolecular units that can grow and divide and transmit collective phenotypic characters to their offspring, and whose
numbers can be changed by competition between alternative phenotypically different variants of those supramolecular units [31]. The claim that compartments are 'units
on which selection can act' [170] seems deeply mistaken.
These compartments do not remotely fulfil the requirements of a proto-organism on which selection can act and
lead to increased complexity [31]. As old ones are not
directly involved in the formation of new ones, they do
not reproduce and are entirely unbiological and irrelevant
to the origin of cells. Nothing is said about their organismal phenotypic properties, nor how genes could change
them so as to increase their rate of reproduction (how can
they when they don't even reproduce?). Compartments
are also supposedly porous, with genes and products diffusing among them [170]; thus they are not discrete in the
genetic sense that matters for evolution. The compartments are merely a heterogeneous environment within
which genes might theoretically evolve; it is not obvious
from their vague statements that these compartments
would be any better able than molecular evolution in a
homogeneous medium (that they rightly criticize as inadequate) to provide real units capable of selection for cooperative proto-organismal behaviour.

The basic problem of these Martin/Russell/Koonin papers
is that they conflate three independent problems: precellular evolution, the nature of the last common ancestor
(clearly cellular, clearly negibacterial), and the nature of
the eubacterium/archaebacterium transition, none of

Page 52 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

which has anything to do with any of the others, according to my phylogenetic analysis [1,31]. Russell's ideas are
irrelevant to the latter two, but are of potential real interest
to the first. These papers are phylogenetically profoundly
wrong and conceptually defective in failing to be cell biologically or evolutionarily realistic.
The suggestion that the first membranes could come from
prebiotic fatty acids [170] is neither unreasonable nor
novel, but probably irrelevant to the early function of SRP
and proton pumping. As I previously pointed out [31],
prebiotic fatty acids were probably so short that membranes made solely of them could have been too permeable to support chemiosmotic mechanisms. I also pointed
out that the first membranes must have been made from
prebiotic lipids made before lipid biosynthesis evolved; at
least that is something we agree on, but it is entirely phylogenetically wrong to link this sensible requirement to
the eubacterial/neomuran transition. However precellular
membrane lipids are more likely to have been a chemically heterogeneous mixture of amphipathic molecules
[31] and it is a pure guess to suggest they were fatty acids
alone. If they were, that would be a reason for the first biosynthesized lipids more likely having been acyl esters than
isoprenoids, i.e. eubacterial in nature. Thus their suggestion [170] leads to a (weak) argument for eubacteria first
and archaebacteria later! As isoprenoid biosynthesis is so
complex and requires many lipid-embedded enzymes
(i.e. relatively complex pre-existing membranes) it
presents a greater chicken-and-egg problem than does the
origin of acyl ester lipids. Fatty acid biosynthesis does not
depend on membrane-embedded proteins, but on water
soluble ones, so may have been easier to evolve by simply
extending pre-existing prebiotic fatty acids.
Limitations and value of genomics
Koonin and Martin also object to the actinobacterial
ancestry of neomura on the spurious grounds that 'no
genome wide data implicate either actinobacteria or low
GC Gram-positive bacteria as ancestors of archaebacteria'.
Even were it true, that would be no reason for preferring
their theory, for no genome-wide data, or any other data,
implicate mineral compartments as the immediate ancestors of archaebacteria! In fact, to his frequent embarrassment, Martin himself showed by analyzing 24,990 genes
of the flowering plant Arabidopsis that more of them are
related both by BLAST and tree criteria to posibacteria
than to any other phylum of eubacteria except cyanobacteria (which we know were enslaved as chloroplasts);
roughly 800 had highest BLAST hits to the endobacterium
Bacillus and ~400 to the actinobacterium Mycobacterium,
compared with only 100–200 for archaebacteria [174].
Moreover, Mycobacterium (Actinobacteria) genes share a
branch with Arabidopsis on trees much more often (148
genes) than do genes of any non-cyanobacterial eubacte-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

ria (2–71 genes depending on species; 2–31 only in Proteobacteria despite their contribution via mitochondria),
with Endobacteria ranking second (93 genes) [174]; only
3–18 archaebacterial genes share a branch with Arabidopsis
despite the established monophyly of neomura. The reason for this poor showing of actinobacteria compared
with archaebacteria is probably that many genes present
in the neomuran ancestor were dramatically changed by
quantum evolution in the ancestral eukaryote alone (so
that yeast genes are much more similar to Arabidopsis
genes than are most archaebacterial genes), and that many
ancestral neomuran genes were lost by archaebacteria [1],
whereas related homologues remained in Posibacteria;
some genes also may have undergone such quantum evolution in the archaebacterial ancestor alone, with similar
consequences for higher perceived similarity between
posibacterial and Arabidopsis genes. The genes with strongest similarity between Arabidopsis and posibacteria are
likely to be those that did not undergo marked changes
during eukaryogenesis but evolved faster in or were lost by
yeast and archaebacteria. Whether archaebacteria are
ancestors of eubacteria as Martin thinks or their sisters, as
I argue, his genomic finding [174] can reasonably be construed as genome-wide evidence supporting actinobacteria as the closest eubacterial relatives of neomura and thus
of archaebacteria. This is genome-wide data and unambiguous; 148 genes support my thesis on trees, precisely contrary to Koonin and Martin's assertion [170] – none, of
course, support inorganic compartments as ancestors. But
this evidence is relatively weak compared with the arguments presented here from proteasomes and phosphatidylinositol
for
an
actinobacterial/archaebacterial
connection.
Based on 191 complete genomes from all three domains,
a recent study selected the 31 most reliable universal proteins for a multigene tree that placed low-GC Gram-positives (Endobacteria) as sisters to neomura with strong
bootstrap support, and also showed archaebacteria as
strongly holophyletic [175], i.e. strongly refuting Martin
and Müller's 'hydrogen hypothesis' that archaebacteria are
ancestral to eukaryotes [176] and supporting my argument that archaebacteria are sisters of eukaryotes
[1,29,129], and related to Posibacteria more closely than
to any Negibacteria. Refutation of a direct archaebacterial
ancestry of eukaryotes (i.e. archaebacterial paraphyly) is
important, because only if eukaryotes were derived from
rather than sisters of archaebacteria is there any reason for
postulating that the ancestors of eukaryotes ever had
archaebacterial lipids [176]; if they are sisters it is more
parsimonious to suppose that acyl ester lipids were inherited vertically by eukaryotes from their eubacterial ancestors [29]. Thus there is no reason whatever for the
unparsimonious hypothesis that eukaryotes replaced
archaebacterial lipids by eubacterial lipids from the mito-

chondrion (anyway inadequate as proteobacteria lack
phosphatidyl inositol and could not have provided this
fundamental eukaryotic constituent, unlike actinobacteria), contrary to [108].
In his own genome-wide analysis [174], many times more
genes support an actinobacterial ancestry for eukaryotes
(which Martin wrongly rejects) than they do for an archaebacterial ancestry for eukaryotes (which he wrongly
accepts, despite all the other evidence against it and for a
sister relationship instead [1,129,175]). The fact that his
genomic evidence does not even suggest a eukaryote relationship with archaebacteria, which all biologists accept,
proves the severe limitations of such crude 'genome-wide'
criteria, unless critically interpreted by explicit evolutionary reasoning such as transition analysis of key characters.
Without this genomics is often unilluminating and sometimes positively misleading; it risks becoming a substitute
for critical thought. It is essential to recognize that molecular evolution is grossly non-uniform across genomes,
lineages, and time. Acceptance, often implicit rather than
explicit, of the false assumption of uniformism has caused
much misinterpretation [129].
Properly complemented by well-grounded biological theory, experiments and organismal data, the copious information from genomics is most valuable. But Koonin and
Martin [170] overvalue genomic data compared with cell
biological and organismal considerations. Many bioinformatic gene counting exercises are very naïve in ignoring
the likelihood of quantum evolution or massive gene loss
during the neomuran revolution, origin of eukaryotes,
and origin of archaebacteria; I present a sounder interpretation of one such study bearing on the nature of the
neomuran ancestor in some detail elsewhere [106]. In
short, gene losses and quantum evolution of sequences
beyond recognition grossly distort such statistics. We
must consider bacterial evolution as a problem of organismal evolution and not base conclusions only on the
sequences of the non-representative minority of genes
that evolved sufficiently trivially to still allow sequence
alignment and tree making.
Concluding remarks: put the organism back into
bacteriology
Contrary to molecular pessimism that neglects organismal properties of bacteria [177], one can plant the tree of
life; in my view the arguments in this and earlier papers
[1,5,178] together unambiguously establish that the universal root is within negibacteria, and that it is most probably among the non-flagellate, photosynthetic, gliding
negibacteria, and most likely of all among or beside the
chlorobacteria. For understanding their evolution, bacteria (=prokaryotes) must be thought of as organisms [1],
not disembodied genes [177]. The thoroughly sound con-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

cept of a bacterium [179] – and (equivalently) prokaryotes – as a distinctive kind of organism is periodically
subjected to muddled but vigorous attacks by a few who
seem to think that a limited rRNA perspective is adequate
for all biology, e.g. [180].
The most recent such assault unwisely seeks to abolish the
very name prokaryote, wrongly asserting that 'no one can
define what is a prokaryote, only what it is not' [181]. That
is untrue: all prokaryotes have cells where the ribosomes,
SRPs, and DNA attach directly to the main surface membrane of the cell, the cytoplasmic membrane, and where
the main chromosome is a single replicon with a single
origin controlled by DnaA-like proteins. Those are universal positive characters of prokaryotes never found in
eukaryotes, as I personally told that author over a decade
ago. Why deny the facts and falsely claim that the concept
of a prokaryote is unscientific? The prokaryote-eukaryote
concept is living and well as the most important cellular
dichotomy in all nature [29,131]; it is emphatically not
'an incorrect model for evolution' [181].
Pace [181] accepts eubacteria as a taxon and name
because he does not realize the strength of my arguments
that they are paraphyletic [1,29], or that the paralogue
rooting evidence for their holophyly is so weak, profoundly misleading [1], and contradicted by other paralogue trees [1,116], not because eubacteria have any more
organismally important, universally shared positive characters than do prokaryotes. One can easily say that all
eubacteria lack SRP helix 19 and N-linked glycoproteins
('what they are not'), but apart from DNA gyrase (also laterally transferred into some archaebacteria and symbiogenetically into eukaryotes) the universal positive
characters of eubacteria ('what they are') are primarily just
a few rRNA signatures [182] and RNA polymerase and
DNA replication enzymatic details [1] that are probably
not of great organismal significance. But all are useful as
extra examples of universal characters that refute the false
claim by many cladists that paraphyletic groups never
have any universal positive characters; though in all these
cases simplistic cladistic dogmas are complicated by their
symbiogenetic infusion into eukaryotes also, especially as
chloroplasts. Murein peptidoglycan, lipoprotein and lipoprotein signal peptidase are ancestral eubacterial synapomorphies that have been lost at least once (e.g. all by
Mollicutes) within eubacteria in addition to their loss by
the ancestral neomuran; these non-universal synapomorphies are organismally more important than the universal
rRNA, DNA handling enzyme ones (lost by the neomuran
ancestor only), despite being more often lost. But both
bacteria (=prokaryotes) and eubacteria are important concepts and biological groups despite their paraphyly and
are in principle acceptable as taxa. I do not use eubacteria
as a taxon because within prokaryotes the negibacteria/

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

unibacteria dichotomy is more ancient and fundamental
than the eubacteria/archaebacteria one and because having subkingdoms Negibacteria and Unibacteria is a more
balanced classification of bacterial diversity [69]. The
terms group, taxon, and clade are not synonyms, as is
explained in detail in [69]. Rejecting any of the names
eubacteria, prokaryotes or bacteria just because these
groups are paraphyletic would be extremely stupid and
very harmful to our ability to communicate sensibly
about evolution and cell diversity. The so-called 'three
domains' [182] are simply 'big groups' of unequal significance; two are clades (eukaryotes and archaebacteria) best
treated as taxa, but not deserving equal rank [see [69], for
discussion of ranking], one is a paraphyletic grade (eubacteria) that is too heterogeneous to be useful as a taxon in
a formal subdivision of the kingdom Bacteria (Tables 1
and 2).
The claim that there may be no real tree of life because of
lateral gene transfer [177] is also profoundly mistaken
and stems from muddling gene trees and organismal
trees; only lateral transfer of cells (not genes), as in sexual
gamete fusion and in symbiogenesis, both restricted to
eukaryotes, makes organismal phylogeny non-tree like.
The tree of life is an organismal phylogeny. All cellular
inheritance in prokaryotes is vertical, not horizontal, as
cell fusion never occurs except occasionally in Streptomyces. It is meaningful to ask whether the last common
ancestor of life had eubacterial or archaebacterial membrane lipids, whether it had one or two bounding membranes, whether it had flagella or not, whether it was
photosynthetic or not.
Yet such fundamental questions are typically ignored
through preoccupation with sequence trees and genes
alone [177]. Genes can survive only by coding for real
physical structures of interacting macromolecules, whose
evolution can and must be studied by transition analysis
of their phenotypes, not just of their gene sequences.
Character losses and lateral transfers of a minority of
genes from time to time complicate reconstruction of the
phenotypes of ancient cellular lineages but do not invalidate it [183,184]; many lateral transfers seem more
important for short-term adaptation than for long-term
phylogeny, and vertical inheritance subsequently dominates even those genes that were acquired laterally
[183,184]. Chemistry of individual proteins is important
to life, but the organism must be put back into bacteriology and evolutionary biology, which have recently been
dominated by fragmentary gene-, sequence-, and molecule-oriented oversimplifications [1]. Cyanobacteria is an
excellent example of a bacterial phylum enduringly
defined on organismal grounds a century before sequencing was invented and which retained its organismal integrity, essential physiological properties, and typical cell

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

structure for at least 2.4, and probable over 2.7 billion
years despite lateral gene transfer; this conservatism
depended on membrane heredity [31,56] – universally
vertical in bacteria, DNA heredity (predominantly vertical), and purifying selection. It was not destroyed by
either mutation or lateral gene transfer as strong purifying
selection can prevent either destroying well-adapted phenotypes; extreme organismal stasis over billenia is a fundamental aspect of life [129]. Even cyanobacterial gene
composition and gene order have not been totally mixed,
despite diversification into thousands of adaptively specialised but basically similar oxygenic phototrophic
strains, and no other physiological types: all cyanobacteria have 181 genes never found in other prokaryotes and
some gene order is totally conserved [185]. It can reasonably be argued that lateral gene transfer has been irrelevant to the large-scale evolution and phylogenetic tree of
cyanobacteria; this is not to deny the occurrence of lateral
gene transfer, especially by cyanophages [186][187,188],
but much of this may just be trivial gene replacement of
no deeper significance for megaevolution or long-term
adaptation than short-term allele jumbling and phylogenetic reticulation by sex in eukaryotes or the replacement
of a worm-eaten beam in a historic building by fresh
wood from an unrelated tree that does not alter its architecture or function.
It has not been demonstrated that lateral gene transfer is a
greater problem (or even as severe a problem) for phylogenetic reconstruction than gene duplications, multiple
gene and character losses, convergent evolution, quantum
and mosaic evolution [129], and other forms of unequal
rates and modes known to confuse the historically dominant vertical phylogenetic signal. All these problems scupper the early naïve expectations by a few biochemists that
one could just let the computer make a few sequence trees,
using necessarily oversimplified assumptions, and reconstruct the history of life accurately without having to evaluate conflicting evidence, make critical judgements, and
weigh disparate data according their mutual congruence
(i.e. a posteriori rather than a priori), as has always been
necessary in systematic and evolutionary biology
[189,190]. But they do not prevent these tried and tested
critically analytic and synthetic methods from unambiguously reconstructing the major features of organismal history.
A recent unduly pessimistic discussion of the logical problems involved in rooting the tree of life [191] suggested
that "'transition analysis' of the structural evolution of the
cytoplasmic membrane might be helpful"; I have shown
here that evolution of the OM is more helpful. However,
transition analysis of a single character is insufficient, for
transition analysis does not place the root in one fell
swoop as protein paralogue trees were mistakenly thought

to. It provides a systematic step-by-step approach. Further
work along these lines will rigorously test my conclusions.
Alternative scenarios can also be tested by evaluating the
polarizations of the transitions they imply in a similar
way, provided this is done in comparable detail.

A striking conclusion of the present analyses and synthesis
is that dramatic evolutionary changes in the cell envelope
have dominated bacterial megaevolution. Three major
revolutions in bacterial cell surface structure and molecular biology stand out as being especially far-reaching in
their impact on the progressive evolution and diversification of life. These are in temporal order: the glycobacterial
revolution; the negibacteria-posibacteria transition; and
the neomuran revolution. Each dramatically changed the
cell surface in ways that profoundly altered future evolutionary potential and the adaptive zones open to the four
major groups of bacteria, whose less dramatic evolutionary diversification they punctuate: Eobacteria; glycobacteria; Posibacteria; Archaebacteria. More accurately dating
these three revolutions, as well as the origin of life itself, is
crucial for interpreting earth history [129]. The last of
these revolutions in bacterial surface structure – the
neomuran revolution – was what made it possible for
phagotrophy to evolve for the first time and thereby create
an endoskeleton and endomembrane system that allowed
morphological complexity to pervade the whole cell, not
just its surface and thus create the eukaryote cell with
immensely greater morphogenetic potential [129] – both
to make the often immensely complex protists, sometimes with more genes than we have, but also really complex multicells like trees, whales, giant kelp, and
toadstools. It is the morphogenetic potential of radically
different kinds of membrane and cytoskeletal structures,
not DNA and gene regulation, that is the key to understanding biological complexity [129].

This manuscript represents a complex synthesis of diverse
data to address the placement of the root of the tree of all
life. The author starts with the premise that molecular
trees are insufficient for this task; this is especially true for
the paralog-rooted trees on which the currently widelyaccepted – indeed, assumed – root placement (between
eubacteria and archaebacteria) are based. Instead, the
author advocates for using "transition analyses" of complex cellular and molecular characters to provide polarizations that can then be used to infer ancestor-descendant
relationships and thus, the root.

In view of their probably most primitive nature among
the eobacteria, Chlorobacteria deserve intensive molecular and cell biological study like that devoted to archaebacteria over the past few decades. Study of the biogenesis
of their outer membrane is particularly important for
understanding early cell evolution and for testing whether
it might be derived by simplification from that of other
negibacteria, rather than the primitive state as argued
here. Characterizing the many lineages known only from
environmental rRNA sequences, establishing the full metabolic diversity of the group, and extensive genomic and
evolutionary studies to determine whether it is holophyletic or paraphyletic are all essential for finally pinpointing the root of the tree of life.

In sum, the author provides data and develops arguments
to support the position of the root within the eubacteria:
specifically it is placed with the Chlorobacteria (green
non-sulfur) representing the earliest diverging eubacterial
lineage, actinobacteria the latest-diverging eubacteria and
archaebacteria derived from actinobacterial ancestors. The
central issue here is that eubacteria with two membranes
(negibacteria) arose first, with those having only one
membrane (gram positives and archaebacteria; unibacteria) evolving from them. This latter argument has been
made repeatedly by this author over the years, but this
manuscript provides the strongest case to date for this
view. The length and detail of the manuscript precludes a
complete point-by-point review; my comments instead
will focus on a few key points raised by the author. Overall, this manuscript provides a plethora of thought-provoking hypotheses that will undoubtedly be subject to
rigorous discussion and evaluation in the light of these
and additional emerging data; this is an important paper
that should be published in Biology Direct.
The abstract indicates that "13 major transitions within
eubacteria" are analyzed and extensively discussed here,
but only a few of them form the crux of the author's case:
1) Outer membrane biogenesis is so complex as to
exclude its origin from unibacterial ancestors; that is, unibacteria must derive from negibacteria.
2) OMP85 homologs cannot be lost; thus, they must have
been gained after divergence of Chlorobacteria.
3) The 20S proteasome evolved from HslVU and not the
converse; this excludes the root from the "proteates"
(Actinobacteria+Archaebacteria+Eukaryota)

4) Flagella arose late during eubacterial evolution from
components of two complexes present only in negibacteria (in particular, cyanobacteria); this excludes the origin
of flagella from posibacteria.
Of these central points, I find only #3 to be compelling
enough to strongly exclude alternatives. If this inference
alone is correct, then the "paralog root" must be incorrect;
instead the root necessarily falls within eubacteria. The author
provides a strong detailed argument for #1 here (and previously elsewhere), and he rightfully points out that the
alternative has been largely assumed without much careful consideration of any details; however, this does not
mean the scenario proposed here is correct. Indeed, it
seems that this main idea (negibacterial ancestors of unibacteria) drives the entire hypothesis presented here,
when in fact many of the characters considered here can
be polarized in opposite directions (including inferred
losses vs. gains). In particular, I argue that most of the data
presented here can be readily reconciled under a model
where the root is alternatively placed within the unibacteria (either within endobacteria or between endobacteria
and actinobacteria). In the following figure, I point out
the major transitions under these alternative roots. I do
not think that either of these posibacterial root positions
can be strongly excluded given current data (presented
here or elsewhere). Although the author notes these root
positions as possibilities in a number of places in the

manuscript, I would like to see a more balanced discussion of such scenarios. Even though the author is strongly
advocating a negibacterial root here, I wonder if a similarly strong argument could be devised for a posibacterial
root placement.

Author's response
You correctly emphasize the four most crucial arguments;
those are the very four polarizations originally highlighted in the stem of the tree of Fig. 3 by thick rather than
thin green bars to emphasize their crucial nature (that figure similarly highlighted the polarizations from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and from eubacteria to neomura that
are equally important but were dealt with in detail in my
earlier publications). You are right that if 3) is correct, it
alone is enough to refute the rooting between neomura
and eubacteria drawn from some paralogue trees. Historically I discovered that argument first, which induced me
to write the paper. Most of the other arguments were discovered during the course of writing and revision.
Number 1 is indeed a development, with additional subarguments, of those I made previously and thus not radically new. However, I consider number 4, which is
entirely new, to be the strongest argument to date against
the root being within Posibacteria. Before discovering it I

seriously considered that the root might be within Posibacteria as you (like Gupta earlier) suggest. However, I
find it hard to believe that the similarities of the distal
domain of TonB and OmpA can be convergent or that this
apparently chimaeric molecule TonB could have first
evolved in a posibacterium with no OM and happened by
chance to have a distal region perfectly preadapted to be
the ancestor of all OM β-barrel proteins that now function
only in a membrane that had not yet evolved. Thus I cannot see how evolution could have gone in the opposite
direction.
It should be pointed out that many of the author's inferences are based on presence-absence assessments using
BLAST analyses of particular proteins and protein families. While such methods are often very useful, they are
sometimes not sensitive enough to detect distant
homologs and they are wholly insufficient to demonstrate
orthology. These caveats, combined with the fact that
there exist considerable biases in the phylogenetic representation of bacterial genomes available demand caution
be exercised in the interpretation of results. Indeed, given
the central importance of Chlorobacteria to this particular
hypothesis, a major issue is the dearth of data currently
available from them (only 2 complete genomes). The
apparent absence of a number of key features (e.g.,
Omp85, HslVU, flagella) have weighed strongly in the
scenario proposed, in which Chlorobacteria are the earliest-diverging eubacteria. Fortunately, ~12 additional
genomes are currently underway (according to NCBI).
Thus, a more careful evaluation of predictions will soon
follow from analyses of additional chlorobacterial
genomes.
Author's response
Presence or absence arguments are well known to be
potentially misleading or ambiguous because absence can
be either primitive or the result of secondary loss, which is
frequent in evolution for many characters (but never
occurs for some). For this reason I have NOT in the
present paper actually weighed absence of HslV or flagella
strongly in placing Chlorobacteria as the earliest divergers
(though I did use absence of both flagella and LPS previously among other reasons to put Eobacteria as a whole
near the base previously [1], before I discovered the much
stronger Omp85 argument). HslV and flagella have clearly
been lost several times during bacterial evolution. But
there is no evidence that Omp85 has ever been lost and I
have explained why its loss would normally be lethal. It is
true that BLAST cannot detect very distant relatives. Thus
distant relatives of Omp85 might one day be discovered
in Chlorobacteria. If they are, the key question would be:
is the great evolutionary distance that has so far prevented
their discovery consistent with their being very early
diverging from typical Omp85 or the result of secondary

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

evolutionary degeneration? Detailed study of their functions would probably be essential to clarify that. As I have
stressed, we do need much more knowledge about their
molecular cell biology to evaluate the evolutionary significance of the Chlorobacteria and to test whether their
apparently primitive characters really indicate the ancestral state for life or not. But if the Omp85 argument is well
founded it does root the tree and enable us to conclude
that the absence of flagella in Eobacteria and Cyanobacteria is also probably primitive. I have explicitly recognized
that most presence-absence characters (or indels) are not
individually useful for polarizing the tree as they can in
principle be interpreted as either losses or gains. But given
the critical polarizations that do root the tree and give it
direction it is useful to plot such other individually less
decisive characters on the tree, as I have, and interesting
that when one does so the more basal branches turn out
to lack a rather large number of such characters found in
the more derived groups. This means that the cenancestral
cell, even though very complex – much more so than
many biologists recognize, had not evolved all the major
eubacterial characters; some were later developments, but
we could not have predicted a priori which these were; the
absence of most of them was NOT used in rooting the tree
in the first place.
Suggestions for improvement:
1. The author mainly uses his own nomenclature (some
published, some new here) for describing organismal
groupings which makes the paper difficult to follow at
times. Table 1 defines most of these names and also
includes important diagnostic information. However, I
suggest that a simpler table without the extra taxonomic
information be provided in addition as a "key" to the
reader.
Author's response
I added a new Table 1 as suggested, retaining the original
as Table 2.

2. I suggest the addition of a simple table in which the
author lists the "13 major transitions" that are mentioned
in the abstract. Indeed, after reading the manuscript it is
unclear to me what all of transitions are.
Author's response
Instead of adding a new table I improved cross-references
in text to Figs 3 and 7, which show the transitions.

This is a very unusual article due to its length and to the
density of its content. Therefore, I will not make an indepth revision of all the characters and transitions discussed in it, or decorticate all the hypotheses produced,
for such an analysis would likely exceed the length of the
present article (and perhaps the patience of the reader). I
will rather concentrate in a few points that are claimed to
be particularly essential for the main objective of this
paper as announced in its title, rooting the tree of life,
which do not appear to me sufficiently unambiguous as to
safely conclude where the root lies.
Strengths (and a word of caution)
The theoretical base enounced at the beginning of the
manuscript to tackle the directionality of evolutionary
change and suggest a position for the root of the tree of life
appears most reasonable. It proposes a combination, or
rather an interpretation, of gene phylogenies with cladistics, transition analysis, congruence testing and critical
palaeontology. If rigorously applied, this strategy should
provide the best approximation that scientists can dream
of to the history of life. However, and unfortunately, there
are various problems associated with all of these
approaches, including the lack of robust data in various
cases, as commented below. Therefore, much caution is
needed to avoid biased conclusions and forcing the interpretation of the data (e.g. polarising transitions) to
accommodate a pre-formed/assumed existing model. To
avoid this, all possibilities should be tested using the same
characters and looking for reasonable interpretations to
see which one is most parsimonious. Even so, there is no
proven rule that evolution follows necessarily the most
parsimonious way man can think of, so that congruence
among different markers/approaches under careful watchfulness is needed. Knowing that, one essential way to
increase the number of meaningful data to place characters on phylogenetic trees is coming back to organismal
biology, as is stated in the concluding remarks of the article. I fully agree that this is imperative.

In addition of the above theoretical principle, the present
manuscript is a valuable source of evolutionary hypotheses. Most of them require rigorous testing before reaching
any positive conclusion, which the author acknowledges
in many cases. Some hypotheses may reveal right, others
wrong. This does not diminish the merit of their formulation. They are open to scientific validation in the future.
However, some of the evolutionary hypotheses that are
formulated, which are crucial to the point made is this
article, are taken for granted on grounds that are not
robust enough, as I discuss below.
Weaknesses
My major concerns relate to the aspects that I comment as
follows.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

1) Methods
The author criticises (rightly) many problems associated
with gene phylogenies and different artefacts affecting
phylogenetic reconstruction that can lead to wrong evolutionary conclusions regarding organismal diversification.
However, BLAST (BLASTp) is used here to determine not
only the presence or absence of particular protein homologues in different bacteria but also to ascertain their phylogenetic affinity (e.g. high BLAST scores of Aquifex P-ring
and L-ring proteins with epsilon- and delta-proteobacteria
are used to "confirm" the putative position of Aquifex
within the Proteobacteria; the eukaryotic enzyme UDP-Nacetylglucosamine is suggested to have been inherited
from Gram positive bacteria because the domain of a glycosyl transferase that makes the capsular polysaccharide
in endobacteria appears among the first BLAST hits,
together with one archaeon, but not with alpha-proteobacteria). Nevertheless, we know that BLAST search is
affected by even more important problems than tree phylogenies, especially if there are compositional biases due
to different types of adaptations. Simple BLASTp does not
absolutely ensure the detection of a distant homologue in
a given organism. More importantly, BLAST cannot be
properly be used to say if a given homologue has been vertically inherited or horizontally acquired. In order to do
this, a careful phylogenetic analysis including a good taxonomic representation and appropriate reconstruction
methods is required [see Koski and Golding, 2001, The closest BLAST hit is often not the nearest neighbor, J Mol Evol, 52,
540–542]. Even so, problems linked to the lack of phylogenetic signal may mask the results. In this sense, BLAST
can be indicative but is not demonstrative. Therefore,
unless proper phylogenetic analyses are carried out and
the results are robust enough, the hypotheses based exclusively in BLAST analyses cannot be confirmed. Whereas
these problems are recognised by the author in various
places of the manuscript, there is a tendency to use BLAST
results as proof in others (or as confirming proof, but if all
congruent proofs are as solid as BLAST hits there may be a
problem in the conclusion), so I would insist in a more
careful formulation of BLAST-based hypotheses.
Author's response
I agree that for intermediate degrees of sequence similarity
phylogenetic analysis is more reliable than BLAST analysis
for establishing detailed relationships. But sequence trees
cannot help at all with the problem (that I explicitly
acknowledged) that BLAST may fail to detect a genuinely
related sequence merely because of extreme sequence
divergence; this is because one cannot make trees with
such divergent sequences even if one could detect their
relationship. For eukaryotic UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
transferase there were no BLAST hits whatever with α-proteobacteria, so trees could not possibly help distinguish
between my suggestion that the enzyme came from a posi-

Page 59 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

bacteria-derived host and the alternative that it came from
the α-proteobacterial symbiont. Here BLAST alone is decisive. The point about Aquifex is primarily that they have
both P-ring and L-ring proteins. High BLAST hits cannot
be produced by convergence so they can confirm the presence of a homologue. I agree that trees can be better than
BLAST for understanding whether a protein gene was vertically or horizontally acquired. But single-gene trees
alone cannot thus discriminate. It is their congruence or
otherwise with a much larger body of external evidence
that does so. It is not obvious that making trees for P-ring
and L-ring proteins would decisively test my assertion that
their presence in Aquifex in conjunction with a peptidoglycan character supports their classification in Proteobacteria. It is important for critics to note carefully the logic
behind my use of BLAST in each specific instance and not
just discount them all because for some other evolutionary problems making trees is greatly to be preferred.
Nonetheless, I strongly encourage anyone concerned by
such questions to make their own trees for any characters
where they consider that so doing would improve interpretation.
2) Paleontological evidence
In various parts of the manuscript the author makes affirmations such as "Palaeontology shows that eubacteria are
much more ancient than eukaryotes" (abstract), "... palaeontological evidence that eubacteria are much older than
eukaryotes..." (introduction: multiple transition analysis...), "morphological fossil evidence that eubacteria are
roughly three times older than eukaryotes..." (introduction: the neomuran revolution), etc. According to him,
(eu)bacteria would have existed already 2.8 Ga or perhaps
3–3.5 Ga ago, whereas eukaryotes and archaea (archaebacteria) would have evolved only ~800 Ma ago. However, the oldest microbial fossil record is full of
uncertainties at present, and does not sustain the above.
There are three types of traces to be considered: morphological, organic biomarkers (fossil lipids) and isotopic.
Morphologically, except for perhaps cyanobacteria,
(eu)bacteria and archaea (archaebacteria) would be indistinguishable in the fossil record. Furthermore, the morphological identification of the most ancient putative
fossils at 3.5 Ga as cyanobacteria or as fossils at all is
highly discussed [Brasier et al. 2002, ref. [158]]. In addition, inorganic structures resembling filamentous organisms can be made purely abiotically [Garcia-Ruiz et al.
2003, Science 302: 1194]. This leads to the conclusion that
morphology alone cannot be seriously trusted. CavalierSmith alludes to the presence of hopanoids, diagnostic
lipids for bacteria, in 2.8 Ga-old rocks. If fossil biomarkers
are to be trusted, then it should be so also for fossil steranes diagnostic for eukaryotes and fossil polyisoprenoids
diagnostic for archaea. Steranes showing alkylation patterns so far characteristic of eukaryotes have been detected

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

in Archaean rocks (Fortescue group, 2.7 Ga) [Brocks et al.
1999, Science 285: 1033]. Although they are claimed to be
probably syngeneticwith the rock by Brocks and Summons,
later contamination cannot be excluded. Nevertheless,
steranes certainly syngeneticwith the rock have been
extracted from ~1.6 Ga-old material at the Barney Creek
formation [Brocks and Summons 2005, in Biogeochemistry,
Schlesinger WH ed., Elsevier, pp. 63–115]. This would be in
agreement with morphological evidence suggesting ~1.5
Ga-old acritarchs as eukaryotes [Javaux et al. 2001, ref.
[146]]. Although most biomarker data likely lie in the
hands of oil companies, diagnostic markers for archaea,
such as crocetane, have been detected in Proterozoic rocks
[Brocks and Summons 2005, in Biogeochemistry, Schlesinger
WH ed., Elsevier, pp. 63–115]. Unfortunately, some fossil
markers, such as phytane, can be derived from bacteria
(cyanobacteria), eukaryotes (plants) and archaea
(archaeol) and are therefore not diagnostic. Finally, C isotopic evidence suggests that methanotrophy and methanogenesis were present 2.8 Ga ago [Hayes, 1983, ref.
[149]]. The author mentions it, but he suggests that we
need to look for alternative explanations. Why? Although
the fossil record can be rigorously criticised, the combination of lipid, isotopic and morphological evidence tends
to support, contrary to the author's claim, that archaea
and eukaryotes are much older than 800 Ma. Palaeontology does not demonstrate that bacteria are older than any
of the other groups. Clearly, more solid data are needed to
resolve this issue, but hopefully, improvement in methods and critical analysis of the Archaean fossil record will
provide a more clear answer in the near future. CavalierSmith's hypothesis that archaea and eukaryotes appeared
more or less simultaneously and only ~800 Ma ago will
then be confirmed or refuted on a palaeontological basis.
In the meanwhile, I suggest that a much more moderate
tone be used regarding the fossil record "proofs".
Author's response
I agree that interpretation of the fossil record is often
problematic. So much so that to discuss the problems in
detail would have taken more space than reasonable in a
paper devoted to the non-fossil evidence. However, I
think the referee is much too dismissive of the morphological evidence and too trusting of the conventional
biomarker and isotopic interpretations. It is wrong to
argue that morphological evidence cannot be trusted
because some is misinterpreted or that all chemical evidence must be trusted if some is. One must also differentiate between the primary evidence and interpretations of
it based on other assumptions. One should not uncritically trust or uncritically reject a whole class of evidence
but evaluate each specific case and decide the strength of
the evidence in question. That I have done. I do not think
my interpretations need changing and have added citations to a parallel paper [129] where I discuss these palae-

ontological matters much more thoroughly and, in
particular, present a detailed interpretation of the ultralight 2.78 Gy carbon isotope spike, showing that it could
have been produced by an ecosystem with only eubacteria
not archaebacteria. Thus it is very unsound evidence for
archaebacteria being that ancient. I think you are wrong in
saying that the fossil record does not demonstrate that
eubacteria are older than eukaryotes. The only evidence
ever provided for that assertion, early steranes, is invalid,
as several eubacteria can make sterols; regarding the 2.7
Gy cases as eukaryotic is also strongly contradicted by the
morphological fossil evidence that does not reveal any
definite eukaryotes for the following two billion years
[1,129]. If we can't be sure they came from eukaryotes it is
irrelevant to discuss whether they are syngenetic or not.
3) Cell membrane
The author emphasises in various places that "the most
fundamental question concerning the root of the tree of
life is whether the ancestral cell had two bounding membranes (i.e. was a negibacterium) or just one membrane as
in archaebacteria and posibacteria" (introduction: multiple transition analyses of complex multimolecular characters can root the tree). According to the author, it is
mechanistically difficult to conceive a transition from a
single membrane (Gram positives) to two membranes
(Gram negative bacteria) (results: membranome evolution). He thus concludes that the transition must have
occurred from a two-membrane bounded cenancestor to
a single-membrane bounded cell in Gram positive bacteria, and hence, in archaea and eukaryotes which, having a
single membrane, would derive from a one-membrane
Gram positive stem. We see here that the major argument
(together with the proteasome that is discussed below)
given to polarise the tree and put the root within the Gram
negative bacteria instead of placing it between (eu)bacteria and archaea, as is more generally accepted, depends
exclusively on the weight that is given to the two-versusone membrane boundary compared to the different stereochemistry of the archaeal and (eu)bacterial membranes.
Which character is more important, the number of membranes or a different membrane stereochemistry? As Cavalier-Smith acknowledges, although still concluding that
this allows polarising the tree, the two-versus-one membrane criterion is not as solid as it appears to be since, for
instance, the archaeon Ignicoccus has two membranes.
Therefore, either Ignicoccus derives directly from a twomembrane bounded cenancestor and the rest of archaea
lost the outer membrane, which would be compatible
with the root of the tree being between (eu)bacteria and
archaea, or an outer membrane evolved in a one-membrane archaeal ancestor independently. This invalidates
the assumed necessity that evolution proceeded from a
two-membrane to a one-membrane state, and therefore,
the most fundamental criterion upon which the polarisa-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

tion of the tree and the proposed root itself are based in
this article. By contrast, no single exception is known to
the different stereochemistry of archaeal (glycerol-1-phosphate-based ether isoprenoid lipids) and (eu)bacterial
(glycerol-3-phosphate-based ester acyl-lipids) membranes. Therefore, the hypothesis that the root of the tree
is placed between both, and that they evolved from a
cenancestor with heterochiral membranes, is perfectly
tenable [Peretó et al., ref. [18]]. In this situation and if the
transition from (eu)bacterial to archaeal membrane
chemistry were evolutionarily impossible, hypotheses
sustaining that eukaryotes resulted from a symbiosis
between archaea and (eu)bacteria in which (eu)bacteria
contributed the membranes would be supported. In the
absence of conclusive data, both rooting alternatives
(within Gram negative bacteria or between archaea and
bacteria) remain possible and hypothetical.
Author's response
It is not a question of one character being more important
than another. What matters is whether a character difference can be used to polarize a transition or not, the direction of the polarization, and the strength of the argument
supporting it. I agree that the lipid difference is important
and previously presented a selective argument to polarize
the tree from the eubacterial type to the archaebacterial
type [1]. The unique stereochemistry of archaebacterial
phospholipids does NOT require that the root of the tree
is between neomura and eubacteria (as you assume) or
that the transition between the two stereochemistries took
place at the root itself. If the root is between neomura and
eubacteria, as is logically possible and widely assumed
(but I argue incorrect), then the ancestral neomuran must
either have had both types of lipids or just one. If it had
the eubacterial type only, this must have been replaced by
the archaebacterial type in the archaebacterial ancestor. If
it had the archaebacterial type alone, this must have been
replaced by the eubacterial type in the ancestral eukaryote,
as Martin and Müller first suggested [176]. If both were
present, one type was lost in each ancestor differentially.
(I discount the possibility that neither was present and
that the ancestral neomuran had a third entirely unknown
kind of lipid as science fiction; that it had no lipid at all
[107,108] is refuted above and by your own arguments
elsewhere [18].) Thus whether the root is in eubacteria or
between eubacteria and neomura there had to be at least
one replacement of one lipid type by another or losses of
two lipid types. No reason has ever been given why
replacement of eubacterial/eukaryotic acyl ester lipids
would have been mechanistically impossible in the common ancestor of archaebacteria. I have now inserted a refutation of a recent flawed criticism of such replacement
[170]. As there is a clear selective advantage for such
replacement as an adaptation to hyperthermophily and
acidophily, the likely ancestral state for archaebacteria,

Page 61 of 83

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

but NOT for a transition in the reverse direction, this has
long a good selective argument for polarizing evolution
from acyl ester to isoprenoid ether lipids, not the reverse
[1,30]. No argument has yet been given that would clearly
polarize the transition in the opposite direction. The referee does not mention my use of flagellar origins to polarize the transition from negibacteria to posibacteria, which
contradicts the assumption that the negibacterial envelope was added to a posibacterium rather than lost to generate posibacteria. The Ignicoccus case is irrelevant to that
polarizing argument, which is logically independent of
my assertion of the difficulty of evolving the negibacterial
envelope. My paper also makes a careful distinction
between merely adding an extra membrane and originating the specific biogenetic mechanisms of the negibacterial envelope, which the above comment overlooks.
4) Proteasome
The second key criterion that is used to polarize the evolutionary transition and place the root of the tree within
negibacteria is the distribution of the proteasome core
particle. It is present in archaea (20S proteasome), in
eukaryotes (26S proteasome) and in some, but not all,
actinobacteria (high GC Gram positive). The two, α and β
subunits, are distantly related to HslV, a protein widely
distributed in bacteria, although absent from cyanobacteria and chlorobacteria (chloroflexi). It is hypothesised
that the proteasome derives from HslV, and that its presence in eukaryotes, archaea and some actinobacteria (to
the exclusion of early diverging actinobacterial lineages)
demonstrates that the root is placed outside a clade
eukaryotes + archaea + Gram positive bacteria (those that
do not have it would have likely lost it secondarily). However, it has also been claimed that the proteasome in
actinobacteria has been acquired by horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) [Gille et al., ref. [47]]. Cavalier-Smith mentions this in his manuscript although, according to him,
the genes are too divergent to safely conclude about their
possible acquisition by transfer. Nevertheless, his strongest argument against a possible horizontal acquisition is
that "Gille et al. did so [proposed the proteasome acquisition in actinobacteria by HGT] through being unaware of
the evidence of a vertical relationship between actinobacteria and neomura and the likelihood that actinobacteria
are much older than archaebacteria, making the assumed
lateral transfer temporally impossible if it is assumed into
their cenancestor (though possibly more likely if it were
into the ancestor of Actinomycetales alone)". However, as
we discussed before, it is impossible to say from the fossil
record whether archaea and the ancestor of the actinobacteria co-existed or not. Consequently, the possibility that
they did coexist and exchange genes cannot be excluded.
If the proteasome was indeed acquired (together with
other archaeal-like genes, see below) by actinobacteria via
HGT, the root of the tree would be logically placed outside

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

of a clade formed by archaea + eukaryotes. Therefore, in
the absence of a clear answer concerning the origin (vertically inherited or horizontally acquired) of the proteasome in some actinobacteria, this character cannot be used
as conclusive evidence to polarize the tree.
Author's response
Because of the conceptual possibility of HGT (albeit not
demonstrated; a claim not supported by a tree [52] or any
explicit reasoning or consideration of realistic alternatives
is not evidence) one can reasonably say that the argument
is not by itself totally conclusive. That is why rooting the
tree requires as any separate polarizations as possible,
plus deliberate searches for congruences and incongruences with other evidence – hence the length of this paper.
The proteate clade is congruent with other evidence, notably the presence of phosphatidyl inositol in all actinobacteria and all eukaryotes and other less universal characters
shared by some actinobacteria and eukaryotes discussed
before [1]. I am not aware of any evidence that convincingly contradicts it.
5) HGT vs. vertical inheritance
Both, vertical inheritance and horizontal gene transfer do
occur in evolution and must be considered without a priori in trying to explain the distribution of genes in
genomes. HGT may affect an important number of genes,
not just single isolated cases. However, although the
author accepts this in some cases (e.g. HGT of genes from
hyperthermophilic archaea to Aquifex and Thermotoga or
an important gain of bacterial genes in Methanosarcinales), he dismisses the possibility that a similar situation
could have affected Gram positive bacteria, i.e. that
archaea transferred an important number of genes to
Gram positive bacteria (e.g. glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase or proteasome genes) upon the single criterion
that HGT "does not need to be invoked" or is "unparsimonious" as duplications and differential losses could also
explain those situations. On the contrary, HGT must be
invoked whenever is suspected, but then tested. The same
mind openness should be applied to all cases, whether
they fit or not our favourite model. Hypotheses on HGT
can be tested by proper phylogenetic analyses provided
that the involved genes contain enough phylogenetic signal. Hopefully, in-depth phylogenetic analyses and congruence testing will prove or disprove some or many of
the hypotheses presented in this article.
Author's response
I broadly agree, except that I do not dismiss any possibilities. People tend to consider HGT a possibility when they
see a tree that goes against their preconceptions. In such
cases one possibility, often insufficiently considered, is
that one or more of their preconceptions (e.g. belief in
position of the root, or single-gene trees always correctly

reconstructing topology) being wrong, rather than HGT,
might better explain the apparent incongruence.
6) Calmodulin, phosphatidylinositol, cholesterol
The author sustains that phosphatidylinositol is present
in all eukaryotes and actinobacteria but not in other bacteria (results: Unibacteria: links between Posibacteria and
Actinobacteria). Similarly, he states that calmodulin-like
proteins are only present in Gram positives and eukaryotes but absent from other bacteria (Results: Monophyly of
Posibacteria). However, this is not correct. Phosphatidylinositol exists also in myxobacteria [Benaissa et al 1994, J
Bacteriol 176:1390]. Calmodulin-like proteins exist in a
wide variety of bacteria, including, for instance, the alphaproteobacterium Rhizobium [Xi et al, PNAS 97:11114].
Furthermore, BLAST searches allow the identification of
calmodulin-like proteins in many different bacteria
including other proteobacteria or cyanobacteria (not
shown). He also says that cholesterol biosynthesis is
present in actinobacteria to the exclusion of all other bacteria. However, except for the very last step leading to cholesterol from 7,24-cholestadien-3β-ol the whole
biosynthetic pathway, as well as all the intermediates,
have been identified in myxobacteria [Bode et al. 2003,
Mol. Microbiol. 47:471] and many other bacteria do synthesise sterols (e.g. methanotrophic proteobacteria,
cyanobacteria, planctomycetes). This together with the
fact that we ignore the metabolic properties of many bacterial groups (see below) makes imprudent, and to some
extent inaccurate, to conclude that the cholesterol pathway is only present in actinobacteria.
Author's response
I revised mentions of calmodulin, as related proteins are
indeed more widespread in eubacteria than I once
thought; BLAST hits are strongest to actinobacteria and
cyanobacteria, weak for α-proteobacteria, and not convincing for archaebacteria, making it likely that calmodulin was acquired vertically from a posibacterial ancestor
rather than from the mitochondrial slave. However the
molecule is so short that trees would be unlikely to clearly
discriminate between such vertical inheritance and lateral
transfer, e.g. from cyanobacterial food. But my other two
points are valid. It is misleading to say that phosphatidylinositol is present in myxobacteria, as the inositol phospholipid of the myxobacterium in question, Stigmatella, is
not an acyl ester phospholipid as in actinobacteria and
eukaryotes but a unique alkyl ether lipid [112], which is
not homologous and thus irrelevant to the argument. To
prevent other readers being similarly misled by this interesting red herring, I inserted an explanation of it. On
present knowledge my statement about cholesterol is also
correct, but I agree that the widespread presence of sterols
in eubacteria makes it possible that cholesterol may occur
more widely than in actinobacteria. However, Summons

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

et al. [192] present convincing evidence that reports of
sterols in cyanobacteria may all be mistaken and result
from low-level eukaryotic contamination of cultures.
7) Unknown diversity
Cavalier-Smith places a series of characters in different
organismal branches and then uses this information to
infer the position of the root (close to the Chloroflexi or
Chlorobacteria) and also to describe a succession of evolutionary transitions in bacteria. It is a valuable attempt,
but it should be also highlighted that it is an approach so
far limited to the restricted fraction of prokaryotic lineages
for which we have some information. Sequencing 16S
rRNA genes from environmental samples has revealed
many novel, divergent, clades. The number of bacterial
groups equivalent to phyla in the Bergey's taxonomy without cultivated and described members exceeds that of
those for which metabolic, genomic and structural information is available [Schloss & Handelsman, 2004, Microbiol
Mol Biol Rev 68:686]. Recent studies on the ultrastructure
and metabolism of previously uncultivated prokaryotic
groups are revealing novel structural features (e.g. an
outer membrane in the archaeon Ignicoccus, a nuclear-like
membrane in the planctomycete Gemmata) or unforeseen
metabolic capabilities (e.g. anaerobic methane oxidation
by some euryarchaeota). Therefore, even if the hypotheses
postulated in this manuscript proved correct, they would
not be conclusive until the characteristics of the remaining
prokaryotic clades were shown to fit in this scenario.
Author's response
I agree that detailed phenotypic and genetic studies of all
these apparently deeply diverging clades are important to
test my classification and rooting and also because of the
possibility that some of them may radically change and
improve our picture of bacterial evolution. However deep
divergence on rRNA trees can occur for many reasons and
does not necessarily indicate radical phenotypic divergence or antiquity. Past experience does not favour the
view that most of these, when better known, will really
deserve to be treated as separate phyla (many may simply
be misplaced divergent representatives of known groups,
as suggested before [1,46]), but this does not minimize
the importance of characterizing them all properly.
7) Ecological considerations
The author makes a number of ecological considerations
that are rather weak. He appears to assimilate primary
producers (organisms able to fix inorganic carbon) to
photosynthesisers, while ignoring chemolithoautotrophs,
which are widespread in several (eu)bacterial and
archaeal phyla. I agree that if all Gram positive bacteria
have always been heterotrophic, they likely co-existed
with primary producers. However, this does not imply
that the last cenancestor was photosynthetic. Photosyn-

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

thesis is likely responsible for most of the primary production on Earth today (although accurate estimates about
the deep biosphere are needed), but the first ecosystems
might have been based primarily on chemolithoautotrophic organisms, such as methanogens (see comment
about palaeontological evidence) or others (sulphur- or
hydrogen-based autotrophic metabolisms).
Author's response
I think it likely that the first organisms were lithotrophs
for energy and heterotrophs for carbon [31]. But I was
NOT discussing the first organisms, whose nature cannot
be rigorously deduced by cladistic comparisons of extant
organisms, but the last common ancestor of all extant
ones (cenancestor), which was much more complex and
at least somewhat more recent, and whose general nature
can in principle be determined by a combination of cladistic and transition analyses of extant lineages. Although
I think it most likely that the cenancestor was photosynthetic, I have an open mind. To find out must study Chlorobacteria intensively and establish whether or not the
root was within them and if so precisely where. It is very
unlikely that methanogens are ancient [1,129], but several
kinds of chemolithotroph could be, but I doubt whether
most, if any, any preceded photosynthesis. I inserted a
brief bit on lithotrophy.
8) Taxonomic rank and nomenclature
Under the evolutionary scheme proposed by CavalierSmith, bacteria are a kingdom and eukaryotes are nested
within bacteria. Yet, instead of being considered a single
phylum, as "archaebacteria" are, eukaryotes are divided in
six different kingdoms. How can a taxonomic category
contain sub-elements that are ranked at the same initial
level? I understand that eukaryotes have a complex morphology and features. However, archaea do possess very
different features too. These concern not only the replication, transcription and translation machineries (that
appear not very important to the author, although being
central to the cell), but also the very nature of the cell
membrane (the membrane being a characteristic that
appears particularly important for Cavalier-Smith). Yet,
archaea are considered a single phylum, sister to the
eukaryotic kingdom. Is this not excessively influenced by
apparent morphological properties to the exclusion of
essential, though less apparent, properties of cells?
Author's response
Actually, I divide eukaryotes into only five kingdoms [69],
not six. The six 'supergroups' in recent discussions
[193,194] that popularize some of my increasing widely
accepted phylogenetic interpretations of eukaryotes are
clades not kingdoms (one only, Plantae, is a kingdom
also; the others are parts of kingdoms or composites of
one or more kingdoms and parts of another, e.g.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

opisthokonts). Many interchange these terms too loosely.
On first reading I could not understand the question 'How
can a taxonomic category contain sub-elements that are
ranked at the same initial level?' A taxonomic category
such as phylum normally includes subelements ranked at
the same level as each other (e.g. classes), but at a lower
level than the parent group (higher category). My classification is consistent with and follows those classical Linnean hierarchical principles. If the referee is worried that
sister clades (eukaryotes, archaebacteria) are not equally
ranked, or equally subdivided, there is no problem whatever with either; it simply reflects the asymmetry of significant progressive evolution. Eventually after several
rereadings, I realised that the referees' question probably
relates not specifically to her preceding sentence but to the
fact that bacteria are paraphyletic yet treated by me as one
kingdom, with five eukaryotic kingdoms derived from it.
In essence she is confusing phylogeny and classification,
as is so often done nowadays (e.g. in a recent profoundly
muddled and conceptually and taxonomically harmful
call for the abolition of the name prokaryotes [181]). Cladistically eukaryotes are indeed nested within bacteria
(=prokaryotes) on the tree. But taxonomically eukaryotes
are not included within bacteria and should never be.
They are sharply separated by the hundred or more major
differences between bacteria and eukaryotes that originated during the origin of the eukaryotic cell [27,29,129].
Elsewhere [69] I explained these key conceptual differences and why such progressive evolution requires the use
of some paraphyletic groups in a comprehensively hierarchical classification of the existing Linnean type, but
inserted a few salient points near the end of this paper.
Categories like kingdom and phylum refer to taxa, which
should always be monophyletic (i.e. holophyletic or paraphyletic), and never polyphyletic, not to clades or grades;
thus many taxa are clades but some are necessarily paraphyletic grades because that is how evolution works, e.g.
both parent species of descendant allopolyploid species,
or the kingdom Bacteria. Provided one understands the
important conceptual difference between taxa on the one
hand and grades and clades on the other [69], and the radical nature of quantum evolution that is the typical cause
of the huge gulfs separating such higher taxa as kingdoms
and phyla [129], one can easily see why some kingdoms
(Bacteria, Protozoa) must be paraphyletic and others
(Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, Chromista) are holophyletic.
In cladistic phylogeny one can reasonably speak of
eukaryotes being nested within bacteria (lower case, referring to a grade); in evolutionary taxonomy, which takes
into account both branching order and the magnitude of
phenotypic differences, saying this is wrong; one has to
say eukaryotes are derived from the kingdom Bacteria, not
nested within it. Ranking is also a complex matter that I
discuss in more detail there [69]. But in my view the key
factors to be considered are the phenotypic homogeneity/

Page 64 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

disparity within a group and the magnitude of the phenotypic gulf separating it from relatives. What characters are
considered more or less important are properly matters
for judgement by the taxonomists establishing taxa and
their ranks. Historically ranks change by the usual processes of new discoveries, different workers putting forward
alternatives, scientific debate, and eventually usually consensus. The simplifying purposes of taxonomy are best
served by keeping the numbers of taxa at higher ranks as
small as we reasonably can. The phenotypic disparity
within archaebacteria, both structurally and in physiologically important characters, is very much less than for
eubacteria, which I divide into nine phyla. As archaebacteria are not obviously more heterogeneous than Posibacteria or Proteobacteria I see no value (and some degree of
overcomplicating harm) in dividing them into more than
one phylum.
Conclusion
In summary, the present manuscript is a substantial
source of hypotheses about bacterial evolution for future
testing. However, the transitions used to place the root of
the tree, namely, the supposed earlier emergence of
(eu)bacteria compared to the archaea based on palaeontological evidence, the obligatory and unique passage
from a two-membrane ancestor to a one-membrane cell,
and the putative vertical inheritance of the proteasome in
archaea and eukaryotes from a Gram positive ancestor, are
not unambiguously supported by the data presented, as
discussed above. Furthermore, since the existing data relative to those transitions are not settled, they could
equally support the generally accepted position of the
root between archaea and (eu)bacteria. Clearly, determining the directionality of those transitions with certainty
requires more confident data and deeper analyses. If the
root of the tree cannot be unequivocally placed at present
using those transitions, then the rest of the characters and
transitions described in the manuscript would point
exclusively to the root of the (eu)bacterial tree. In this
sense, the possibility that the root of the (eu)bacterial tree
lies close to, or within the Chlorobacteria is appealing. I
agree with Cavalier-Smith that much attention must be
paid to study this group, without forgetting to study the
characters of the large bacterial diversity observed by 16S
rRNA genes for which no information is available. "Put
the organism back into bacteriology" is indeed crucial.
Author's response
I note that you offer no objections to either of the two
most original new polarizing arguments presented here;
the use of flagellum origins to polarize the transition from
negibacteria to posibacteria, and of Omp85 to exclude the
root from all negibacteria except Chlorobacteria. If they
are correct, which the last part of your conclusion tends to
concede, the root could be placed between neomura and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

eubacteria only if the unimembranous character of cell
surfaces in neomura and Posibacteria are convergent (very
unparsimonious) and if all the numerous similarities
between actinobacteria and neomura are dismissed as
convergent or by HGT (also very unparsimonious). The
morphological fossil evidence that there are no unambiguously eukaryotic fossils that can reliably be assigned to
extant phyla before about 800 My ago [129] should not be
so lightly dismissed. Even Knoll [195], who interprets as
stem eukaryotes (i.e. those diverging prior to the
cenancestor, but now extinct) some earlier fossils that I
consider much more likely to be eubacteria, does not
claim morphological evidence for stem eukaryotes before
1800–1500 Gy; the earliest date given is only for Grypania,
which some other palaeontologists, like me, do not accept
as eukaryotic since evidence for that assignation is exceedingly weak and trivial; he does not provide any convincing
morphological fossil evidence that the eukaryote
cenancestor is any older than I stated; the only morphological claim he makes for a specific eukaryote phylum
before about 800 My is for Bangiomorpha, which he originally identified as a red alga, but I consider to be a cyanobacterium [1,129]; his identification is inconsistent with
the Bayesian integration of 18S rRNA sequence data best
and multiply highly reliable eukaryotic microfossil dates
[36,196]. Morphology provides strong evidence that
eukaryotes are much younger than eubacteria, which on
any interpretation must be at least as old as the great oxygenation event of 2.45 Gy ago [134], and are probably
much older. But these fossil arguments, discussed in detail
elsewhere [1,129], are entirely independent of the transition analyses presented here. It is very significant that
both these independent lines of evidence are mutually
congruent and that both are incongruent with the root
being between neomura and eubacteria.

Preamble to the reader
Before starting my detailed review of this paper, I want to
express my personal esteem for T. Cavalier-Smith repeated
contributions to the field of evolutionary biology. All
along the years, he has often put forward important ideas
and original hypotheses that have prompted many
debates about the evolution of life, all domains included.
Multiple tests of his works have taught us that even if T.
Cavalier-Smith's claims were not necessarily right, his
thought provocative publications always deserved the
consideration of the scientific community. Without a

doubt, T. Cavalier-Smith has an impressive biological culture and there is a lot to learn from him. There is also
another more special motive to read T. Cavalier-Smith: his
very interesting scientific style. Certainly, his global, synthetic, systematic approach often leads him to produce
very long papers. Yet, as far as I am concerned, I find such
papers fascinating to read, as they exposed not only elaborated and integrated narratives about evolution, but also
as they introduce a very original evolutionary epistemology. It is not uninteresting to analyze T. Cavalier-Smith's
treatments of his explicit and implicit methodological
principles all along a paper, and how, sometimes while he
pretends to practice the most solid mainstream hard core
science, he is in fact proposing audacious heterodox interpretations. In one words, some parts of the works of this
major author are pretty subjective, and to me, this observation is not a criticism. Imaginative efforts of interpretation and in depth analyses are obviously deeply needed in
the complex area of evolutionary biology. There are thus
many reasons why someone might want to read even the
longest T. Cavalier-Smith papers, as they can be fun,
enriching and compelling. Yet, because of the level of
complexity of those papers where T. Cavalier-Smith pilots
us at will, we should always remain cautious before turning into enthusiastic unconditional supporters of his
views. The present contribution does not make exception.
It is certainly an attractive and stimulating paper, and it
will take multiple additional analyses by several specialists to evaluate some of its taxonomical and mechanical
hypotheses of evolution. Personally, I remain agnostic on
most of the conclusions presented here but I want to
encourage numerous readers to test as much as they can
this highly interesting version of Cavalier-Smith's Tree of
Life, with alternative tools, logic and interpretations.
To the author
I totally agree with your opinion that "an integrative
approach, though recently unfashionable, is sorely needed in
the face of the mass of new genomic data to suggest biologically
well-grounded hypotheses to guide detailed experimental studies in the laboratory." (P.6, paragraph 4, the primacy of
transition analysis), and I support your impressive efforts
in this sense. I obviously encourage the publication of
your manuscript, but I insist that some revisions could
improve its quality and makes it more readable. This is
why the rest of my comments are either suggestions, critics
or questions that I would be honored you address.

As it presently stand, I feel that the paper contains 3 different papers in one: (i) the rooting of the tree of life by transition analyses, (ii) the proposition/definition of several
new clades (such as the gracilicutes, etc.), (iii) the re-affirmation that Archaea are really recent. I think that these
three papers, related but different in scope, would benefit
from individual submissions and very likely from the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

expertise of different specialists to be as seriously evaluated as they deserve. I feel that otherwise there is a risk for
some of your numerous conclusions to be overlooked by
referees, who would like to encourage the publication of
the main conclusion of this paper, supposedly about the
root of the tree of life, but finally about all the tree of life.
Author's response
Although some lesser conclusions, e.g. the clade Gracilicutes, may have less impact than if published separately, I
do not favour publishing numerous small fragmentary
papers. I prefer to combine them so the reader can appreciate how related topics fit together. This is especially
important for the present subject on which so many different considerations necessarily impinge. A fundamental
scientific reason why it was important to present the evidence for gracilicute monophyly here, is that it simplifies
arguments about placing the root, because they can be
considered as a unit rather than as four separate phyla
whose relationship to the root must be individually
argued (as Bapteste points out below). The same principle
applies to every phylum and higher-level group, especially
those whose monophyly I discuss in fair detail, e.g. Posibacteria and Eurybacteria. One cannot root the tree by taking every species as a separate unit and has to concentrate
on transitions between well-defined large groups. As some
groups were not previously sufficiently well defined, and
would have been questioned by many microbiologists
much more strongly than is now likely with the additional
evidence adduced here for their monophyly, providing
such evidence was essential. This paper had to do three
logically distinct things: (1) better define major monophyletic groups, (2) better establish their correct branching order by cladistic reasoning, and (3) use transition
analysis to polarize as many of the transitions between
them as possible and thereby establish the position of the
root. Thus it is indeed three papers in one, but the first two
tasks are essential prerequisites for the third, primary goal
of this paper and thus could not have been done later in
separate papers. The title refers only to my final goal, rooting the tree, not the two necessary preliminaries; but they
are critically important foundations, not peripheral extras.
A fourth topic, dating the various prokaryote phyla
including archaebacteria, for which palaeontology also is
vital, is discussed in much more detail in a parallel paper
[129] but needed some consideration here so that the
reader can see that transition analysis inferences and palaeontological evidence are congruent, and thus mutually
reinforcing.
Comments about the existence of a tree of life and its root
I think that your discussion about the Tree of Life, which
comes closer to the end of the manuscript than to the
beginning, p.105–106, could be more balanced, as you
take the existence of a tree as an a priori hypothesis, and

Page 66 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

you never test it. "The claim that there may be no real tree of
life because of lateral gene transfer [158]is profoundly mistaken; all cellular inheritance in prokaryotes is vertical, not horizontal, as cell fusion never occurs except occasionally in
Streptomyces. It is meaningful to ask whether the last common
ancestor of life had eubacterial or archaebacterial membrane
lipids, whether it had one or two bounding membranes,
whether it had flagella or not, whether it was photosynthetic or
not" is a little too short to summarize a complex debate.
This might deserve more explanations. In fact, one can
wonder if your conclusion that 13 characters are congruent means that the majority of the metabolic/ultrastructural characters also followed this common vertical
backbone? And if not, it questions us on the robustness of
the tree presented here and about what will happen when
more characters will be added to polarize different part of
it. At this topic, you acknowledge that the resolution and
clade definition is sensitive to the sampling of characters,
and you expose that it is possible that in the future other
characters might contradict your present conclusions.
Should it be the case, you would change the groups definitions – that renders the paper so long – or you would
change the synapomorphies, but you would never really
challenge the very idea of a vertical universal structure on
which one could map all the characters evolution. Why is
it a safe practice? Could you comment a little bit more on
your tree-like perspective in the MS?
From my narrow phylogenic perspective, it is presently
unclear to me that character evolution has to follow a treelike pattern for all the organisms. There are certainly some
cases of lateral gene transfers, and differential losses that
can be misleading. You as well mentioned some complex
situations (p.6)" with congruence testing a serious mistake in
one part of the tree may be revealed by incongruence with other
parts. If two polarizations in different parts of the tree are
incongruent (contradictory), then either the topology of the tree
is incorrect or one of the polarizations is incorrect, and the
source of the conflict can be sought for and at least one of the
interpretations corrected in the light of the overall evidence
from as many sources as possible". You claim that your characters are immune to this problem, but is there any formal
way/test to make us confident about which characters did
not undergo an incongruent evolution and which ones
did?
Author's response
The issue here relates to lateral (or horizontal) gene transfer, which has been important in bacterial evolution.
However, cell inheritance is always strictly vertical in bacteria, much more so than in eukaryotes where sexual cell
fusion makes even cell inheritance reticulate on the
microevolutionary scale, and thus not tree-like. On the
largest scale the rare instances of intracellular cell enslavement (symbiogenesis) mean that large branches have

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

occasionally fused long after they diverged (as in the origin of mitochondria), but such cell enslavement apparently never occurred in bacteria. Thus all prokaryote
evolution has been in the context of repeated growth and
division and exclusively vertical inheritance of whole cells
composed of membranes, genomes, cell skeleton, and a
network of catalysts including ribosomes and enzymes.
Against this historical dominance of universal verticality
of cell lineages repeated instances of lateral transfer of
genes have substituted foreign but broadly functionally
equivalent versions of some enzymes and also added others that are novel to a lineage, having first evolved elsewhere. In real trees branches can fuse, so it is a
philosophical issue, rather than a practical one, whether it
is appropriate to call this composite pattern tree-like or
not. Nobody denies that both vertical and horizontal
inheritance occur, so it is not helpful to discuss this issue
at more length here. There certainly is a 'vertical backbone'
(to use your phrase) to bacterial evolution set by successive cell cycles and the vertical transmission of all cellular
characters. Asking whether most characters followed this
backbone or not is somewhat oversimplified. This is
because a character like rRNA can follow that pattern
almost exclusively and yet very occasionally be transmitted laterally by gene transfer. Even if most genes have at
least sometimes been subject to lateral transfer it would be
wrong to imply that this is the dominant mode of inheritance. Probably for most genes most of the time inheritance is vertical. This paper is concerned with the evolution
of major characters that can be used to define bacterial
phyla and subkingdoms and in determining their evolutionary relationships, i.e. with organismal evolution, not
the evolution of individual genes. These major characters
are essentially all multigenic, and often complex
ultrastructural ones, for which there is no evidence that
lateral transfer has been significantly involved in their
evolution. I cannot stress too strongly the vertical inheritance of membranes, cell skeletons and whole metabolic
pathways. It is a basic fallacy to regard bacteria or eukaryotes as being simply the product of their genes and
genomes. Genes can do nothing outside this structural
framework. It is not clear even in theory how lateral gene
transfer could cause a structural innovation like the origin
of thylakoids or the addition or loss of an outer membrane. To use the word phylogeny to apply just to gene
sequence trees is, as you candidly admit, a too narrow
interpretation. One must consider structures and morphogenesis as well as genes in phylogeny. These considerations are a key to establishing the vertical cellular
framework as securely as possible, which will allow us to
assess more properly the modifying impact of lateral gene
transfer, which appears to be of very variable quantitative
significance in different parts of the tree and among different types of characters, and is not a universal obstacle to
reconstructing large scale organismal history as is some-

times exaggeratedly claimed. With respect to congruence
or incongruence of polarizations, I claim only that the
polarizations I deduced are mutually congruent, and if
correct require the root to be where stated. For any other
position one or several of my polarizations must be
shown to be wrong. Their number is so small we do not
need formal methods to test their mutual congruence. The
issue is simple; each of my polarizations is either right or
wrong. If in future any other characters are discovered to
give polarizations incompatible with my conclusions, we
must examine precisely which specific polarizations
appear mutually incompatible and then work out which
alternative is more solidly based, using every piece of evidence and line of reasoning available to us. Because the
way to resolve such purely hypothetical conflict must be
case-specific, I cannot now suggest precisely how to do it.
The situation might never arise, as strongly contradictory
character polarizations might not exist, but additional
characters that can be strongly polarized should be
sought, for the more we have that are mutually compatible the more confident we can be of the conclusion they
yield.
You wrote "Figure 2 emphasizes that the most fundamental
question concerning the root of the tree of life is whether the
ancestral cell had two bounding membranes (i.e. was a negibacterium, as argued here) or just one membrane as in archaebacteria and posibacteria." This might indeed be an
important question. However to me the most fundamental question concerning the root of the TOL is: "is there a
single last common ancestor bearing all the characters
investigated here or could some of the defining features
have been carried by different individuals of contemporary populations?" Do you have any way in your methods
to test that there is indeed a last common ancestor and not
multiple contemporary ancient populations, possibly
exchanging DNA at that time or responsible for the evolution of some feature used here? I am not referring to
poorly shaped progenotes there, as your last common
ancestor seemed itself fairly evolved. In fact, could an
organism such as the last ancestor of all life, "a non-flagellate, non-spore-forming, eubacterium with acyl-ester membrane lipids, a murein peptidoglycan wall, and fully developed
eubacterial molecular biology and cell division mechanisms"p.101, have really been alone on Earth, immune to
any character exchanges with contemporaries? If not, why
would we like to trace back all the living beings characters
to such a single root?
Author's response
There probably were 'multiple contemporary populations' at the time of the cenancestor. But that does not
mean that some had two membranes and some one! I
should be surprised if they were not exchanging DNA at
all, if only by viruses. Nonetheless all modern life could

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

have descended (and probably did if cell fusion did not
then occur) from just one of those cells and it is the properties of that one that is inferred by phylogenetic reconstruction of the cenancestor. We cannot hope to
reconstruct every detail, nor say anything about contemporary forms that became extinct. To assert that the
cenancestor had the few characters specified is NOT to
assert that no gene transfer was then occurring for 'any
characters'.
Comments about the transition analysis methodology in general
It might be interesting/helpful to clarify for the readers the
conditions under which your approach will succeed, but
also the conditions under which your methods would fail.
I imagine lateral gene transfers, a common ancestor lacking any of the characters used in the transition analyses, a
too large number of ancient phyla to be resolved by a few
synapormorphies, might be problematic. Considering
these conditions, do we know if the use of the methodology is safe as such a deep level as the root of the TOL?
Author's response
Obviously, as I stressed, some simple transitions seem in
principle to be possible in either direction and are not
helpful for polarization. Also obviously, we cannot expect
to find polarizable transitions in every part of the tree. But
fortunately we do not need to polarize every branch of the
tree and fully resolve it to every cell generation that has
occurred in four billion years. What we care about is accurately resolving the big picture, not reconstructing every
trivial detail. This answers the too many phyla question.
Taxonomists actually define phyla by choosing big structural differences about which we care. This limits their
number. Just looking at sequence trees has led some to use
'phylum' too loosely in an unhelpful way and refer to far
too many bacterial 'phyla' to be useful. I think the 10 in
Table 2 are enough given present knowledge, but future
discoveries might require more. 'A common ancestor lacking any of the characters used in the transition analyses' is
simply refuted. Logically the cenancestor must have had
either one or two membranes, or either peptidoglycan or
not or flagella or not, or lipopolysaccharide or not. Lateral
transfer of a character could confuse cladistic grouping of
taxa by shared derived characters (for example of Actinomycetales with neomura, if proteasomes were transferred
by transfer of genes from archaebacteria to the ancestral
actinomycete), but it would not confuse the polarization
of the direction of evolution (e.g. from HslV to proteasome rather than the reverse) as it is essentially irrelevant
to the reasoning involved.
Comments about the numbers and the definitions of the clades
A limited number of characters can only resolve a tree if
the numbers of clades is itself limited. We seemed to be in
such a favorable situation here, but how can we be sure

Page 68 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

that the 10 clades you retained are correct/acceptable,
independently of the character you used to polarize the
tree? Are not we lacking some independent evidence at
this topic? I see how some clades take form as the outcome of your transition analyses (i.e the monophyly of
Posibacteria, the location of Fusobacterium in Eurybacteria, the Glidobacteria), but don't you think that some
clades could/should be more thoroughly established
independently of these characters or a priori? If most of
your clades are not defined independently of the characters used to postulate the root of the tree, then maybe
more characters could just dramatically challenge your
conclusions. Could you please comment on that, so that
it does not seem that you are forging the groups that are
matching your conclusions, instead of, for instance, being
unable to resolve the problem. You could maybe summarize in a table further but independent evidence in favor
of each of your clades and recall the results of phylogenetic trees of core markers about these groups? Are they
for instance recovered in the paper of Cicarelli et al. published in Science, vol. 311, on March the 3rd, 2006? (I do
not like this paper but maybe it could help supporting
some of your claims). Should these trees be non existent,
they could then be reconstructed by anyone who would
like to test your propositions. I feel that this proposition
might allow you to shorten your text a lot (see below),
and thus encourage more people to discover its message.
Author's response
Actually the core of Posibacteria was defined as a taxon (as
Firmicutes or earlier informally Gram-positive bacteria)
decades before anyone asked whether the first cells had
one or two membranes, so your assumption is historically
incorrect. Furthermore none of the three groups you mention are clades. Posibacteria, Eurybacteria and Glidobacteria are all paraphyletic grades, but nonetheless good taxa.
You cannot and should not attempt to establish clades a
priori. But seeking independent evidence for relationships
is desirable. But the key polarizations are independent
of the uncertainties you mention. Thus, for example, the
logic of polarization from negibacteria to posibacteria is
independent of whether Posibacteria are paraphyletic or
polyphyletic: my arguments show that neither endobacteria nor actinobacteria can be ancestral to negibacteria as
both have the same type of flagellum and neither has
either of the two probable precursors of flagella. Thus
both must be derived from negibacteria, irrespective of
whether the OM was lost by their common ancestor, as I
argue, or twice independently. Whether eurybacteria are
paraphyletic or polyphyletic also does not affect the
Omp85 argument that excludes all of their sublineages
from the base of the tree. Likewise for glidobacteria. Thus
none of the key polarizations that led to my rooting is
affected by the particular uncertainties you mention.
The Ciccarelli 31 protein 191 species tree [175] shows

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

archaebacteria as holophyletic sisters to eukaryotes
(exactly my tree, and contradictory to common assumptions that archaebacteria are ancestral to and much older
than eukaryotes, e.g. [176]) and Endobacteria as sisters to
neomura with high bootstrap support (80–100%) but
places Actinobacteria among negibacteria as sisters of
Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes (with very low support
and contrary to my tree). All other relations of major
groups on their tree have only moderate support. Of my
10 bacterial phyla one (Chlorobacteria) is represented by
only one sequence and five are clearly monophyletic
(Archaebacteria, Spirochaetes, Hadobacteria, Cyanobacteria with strong support, and Sphingobacteria with moderate (40–80%) support). Planctobacteria appear
polyphyletic with Chlamydiae and Planctomycetes not
grouping together; but the rearrangement needed to
group them would cross only very weakly supported
branches and both are grouped with Sphingobacteria and
Spirochaetes, as in my tree, but also with Actinobacteria,
(contrary to my system) with moderate support. Interestingly, this tree also places Acidobacteria (widely treated as
a separate group because of poor 16S rRNA resolution)
within Proteobacteria (with very strong support (98%), as
sisters to Deltabacteria) as I first proposed [1]. Thus Proteobacteria in my broader sense than usual [1] is monophyletic except for the exclusion of Aquifex, which groups
instead with Thermotoga, with strong support (though the
authors recognize this could be hyperthermophilic bias as
argued here). Interestingly this hyperthermophilic branch
has only weak support for its unresolved position within
negibacteria; but it is within Negibacteria and there is
strong bootstrap support for excluding it from the neomuran/Endobacteria clade, contrary to 16S rRNA that tends
to group them with neomura. Thus only three of my phyla
are not shown as monophyletic: Proteobacteria, solely
because of the exclusion of Aquifex, Posibacteria because
Actinobacteria do not group with Endobacteria (but bootstrap support is only moderate (40%–80%, and Actinobacteria would not need to cross a highly supported
branch to join them), and Eurybacteria. This 31-protein
tree is more concordant with my analysis than any other
multigene tree I have seen, and is very much better than
single-gene (e.g. 16S rRNA) trees in its concordance with
organismal characters; the only taxon that would need to
be moved across a strongly supported branch to make it
concordant with my tree is Aquifex. Moving Aquifex to Proteobacteria would also make Eurybacteria (represented
only by Thermotoga and Fusobacterium) monophyletic.
Thus only three branches need be moved to make all 10
of my phyla monophyletic (the thermophilic Aquifex
across one with strong support, the GC-rich and thus possibly biased Actinobacteria across a moderately supported
one and Chlamydiae across weakly supported branches
only). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria would need to
be moved across only moderately supported branches to

Page 69 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

make both Gracilicutes and Posibacteria monophyletic.
Even Glidobacteria and Eobacteria are monophyletic on
this tree, but with weak support. The remarkably high
concordance of this 31-protein tree and my groupings by
ultrastructure and molecular cladistic characters, entirely
independent evidence, strongly suggests that both are
close to the truth; the multigene tree would probably be
further improved by having more representatives of
weakly sampled taxa, but 31 proteins are probably not
enough for complete resolution. Ideally the number of
proteins and number of taxa need to be at least doubled.
With respect to eukaryotes that tree is good in having
monophyletic fungi, animals, opisthokonts, unikonts,
Plantae, and chromalveolates, but wrong (because slightly
misrooted) in showing paraphyletic bikonts and excavates, but the latter are very poorly sampled. Finally, the
conclusion by Ciccarelli et al. [175] that their tree supports a Gram-positive ancestry of eubacteria is wrong,
because it is based on the mistaken assumption (nothing
to do with their tree, which is necessarily unrooted) that
the root is between eubacteria and neomura. If the root is,
as shown here, beside or within Chlorobacteria, their tree
supports instead the Gram-positive origin of neomura, as
I first proposed [29], and contradicts the widespread
assumption that Thermotoga and Aquifex are deeply diverging eubacteria or have any particular relationship to
archaebacteria.
Comments about the transition analysis of a single character versus
the transition analyses of multiple characters simultaneously
The congruence between transition analyses is a both a
key and, with all the respect I have for you, a blind spot of
your methodology, at least the way it is currently written...
I do not want to seem negative: what I mean is that I wonder if there are not multiple equiparcimonious scenarios
of transition analysis when we look at data character by
character. I am sure you considered that, and identify
these possibilities. For instance, you might have deduced
that character 1 was compatible with two stories A and B,
but as the TS analysis of character 2 was in favor of the
story A, you might have retained the story A as the correct/
congruent scenario for both characters. For instance, the
evolution of the flagella requires a certain condition of the
membrane, you said, before proposing a congruent scenario that would explain how these two features evolved.
Intermediate results of your analyses, not only the conclusions, could be important as well for the readers. Maybe,
you could resume the different equiparcimonious scenarios in a table character by character, so that anyone could
check which are the almost congruent alternative scenarios for the root, if there are some. Furthermore, other
researchers could then use the full extent of your work to
add their own new characters. Maybe, when they will add
new data, the congruence between transition analyses of
multiple characters may then favor a different but equi-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

parcimonious scenario for the character 1 (i.e. maybe
now, story B will be the one to use to build the most congruent scenario). Proposing these intermediate considerations would finally convince anyone that you envisaged
and tested (exhaustively) or many possibilities and would
help not to overlook alternative rooting propositions.
Author's response
There are some indels that partition the tree into two
parts, but which do not polarize the direction (i.e. they
could have been insertions or deletions); some character
gains could also be interpreted as losses. I have already
been careful to distinguish between such characters that
can in principle be interpreted in either direction and
those where I think direction can be inferred (and gave my
judgement about the relative strengths of these inferences). I have NOT presented as strongly polarizing any
characters that I think can be equally parsimoniously
interpreted in the opposite direction. I had already discussed the implications of placing the root in other places,
e.g. between neomura and eubacteria, between proteates
and the rest, between Posibacteria and the rest, within
Gracilicutes. As the number of currently polarizable transitions is not large, a critical reader can readily take the tree
of Fig. 7 and reroot it as they wish in yet other places and
easily see which polarizations discussed here have to be
reversed in each case. They can similarly switch any
branches where they consider I have the topology wrong
and explore its implications. To answer your question
about how my ideas changed as my research progressed,
when I had only the neomuran and proteasome transition
arguments, before discovering the flagellum origin and
Omp85 polarizations, I took the possibility of a root
within Posibacteria very much more seriously than I now
do. Before I came across the sortase data I was less confident in the monophyly of Posibacteria. I have considered
all possible positions of the root between the taxa on Fig.
7 and the possibility that it might be within any of them,
and reduced the possibilities that seemed defensible to
just two: beside or within Chlorobacteria. I also considered several variants for the eubacterial topology, but not
exhaustively, as I think the evidence for a bipartition
between Gracilicutes and the rest to be very strong. You
will notice that Fig. 7 differs from my previous tree [1] in
placing cyanobacteria below the eurybacteria/gracilicute
dichotomy, rather than as sisters to eurybacteria; this
requires testing more rigorously by stronger characters if
they can be found. So does the relative position of cyanobacteria and Hadobacteria, which still lacks a really
strongly polarizing character; their interchange would
require different assumptions about which characters
were differentially lost or gained between them, but
would not change the root position. If correctly rooted, a
31-protein tree published while my paper was being

Page 70 of 83

reviewed [175] shows the same topology as Fig. 7 for
Glidobacteria, but with weak support.
Comment about the bounding membranes
In "Multiple transition analyses of complex multimolecular characters can root the tree, paragraph 1", you wrote
"Figure 2 emphasizes that the most fundamental question concerning the root of the tree of life is whether the ancestral cell
had two bounding membranes (i.e. was a negibacterium, as
argued here) or just one membrane as in archaebacteria and
posibacteria (collectively therefore called unibacteria [1]), as
has traditionally been widely assumed." Could you comment
on Koonin EV, Martin W. (On the origin of genomes and
cells within inorganic compartments. Trends Genet. 2005
Dec;21(12):647–54. Epub 2005 Oct 11) who offered an
alternative to this view?
Author's response
That paper has all the same fundamental flaws as Martin
and Russell's [98] on which it is based and which this
paper already criticized. First they assume that the root is
between neomura and eubacteria, ignoring all earlier
arguments to the contrary [1], and which the transition
analyses presented here and the palaeontological evidence detailed in [129] very strongly refute. Second they
assume that the cenancestor had no developed lipid
membrane and that the cenancestor consisted essentially
of genes and proteins enclosed in a honeycomb of inorganic compartments, but free to move among them! That
is seriously incompatible with all we know of cell biology
and the numerous characters shared by neomura and
eubacteria that convincingly show that the cenancestor
was a complex cell with at least one bounding lipid membrane (I gave four strong arguments for this in the present
paper) and at least a thousand genes. Thirdly they assume
that DNA replication evolved independently in eubacteria, also very non-parsimonious compared with my interpretation of a eubacterial-neomuran transition with rapid
quantum evolution in DNA handling enzymes caused by
histones replacing DNA gyrase [1]. Finally the postulated
inorganic compartments could not have been capable of
multiplication by growth and division as discrete units on
which natural selection could act individually, and whose
multiplication could be modulated by gene-coded proteins in the way that lipid membranes can. Such organismal properties conferred by a mutualistic symbiosis
between lipid membranes, genes, ribosomes and proteins
was essential for evolution to progress beyond the level of
competing selfish genes to the level of complexity that can
reasonably be inferred by cladistic arguments for the
cenancestor [31]. The untenable thesis of their paper is an
outstanding example of the consequences of taking insufficient note of cell biology and palaeontology, and the
actual mechanisms of progressive evolution, and focusing
almost solely on genes and enzymes and a narrowly uni-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

formist interpretation (basically mistaken, see [129]) of
sequence data. Their criticisms of the actinobacterial
ancestry of archaebacteria are fallacious, as explained in
new sections of this paper.
Some arguable claims
In "Multiple transition analyses of complex multimolecular characters can root the tree, paragraph 2, p.13", you
mentioned that "bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses
calibrated by multiple palaeontological dates for 143 proteins
[31]and for 18S rRNA [32]suggest that the eukaryote
cenancestor was only about 1.1 Gy old, whereas the fossil record
indicates that eubacteria are at least 2.8 and probably about
3.5 Gy old [1,33]." To my knowledge, Hug and Roger are
about to publish a paper suggesting that this molecular
dating of eukaryotes, among other, is not convincing.
Since it is fairly accepted that molecular dating is indeed
not satisfactory enough, you might be willing to tone
down the claim based on such references. I think the age
of the origin of eukaryotes is not settled so far, at least by
phylogeny.
Author's response
Roger and Hug [35] indeed reanalyzed those very data by
a technically superior method estimating parameters for
each gene separately, not concatenating them all; this
yields an even younger date of ~900 My (not 1100 My as
in [34]) for the eukaryote cenancestor – strictly speaking
the divergence between Amoebozoa (the phylum with the
oldest fossils I accept as indubitably eukaryotic) and all
other eukaryotes, which is probably essentially the same
given the lack of resolution at the base of the tree. They
also analyse other smaller data sets by a variety of methods that give somewhat earlier dates, but none as old as
eubacteria. Despite the problems they carefully discuss
[35], the best analyses (see also [196]) clearly support the
cenancestral eukaryote as much younger than eubacteria.
Furthermore, the compelling evidence that the enslavement of an α-proteobacterium preceded the cenancestral
eukaryote proves that α-proteobacteria (eubacteria) are
older than eukaryotes. Unless you were to root the tree of
life between α-proteobacteria and all other organisms
(which would entail neomura being derived from eubacteria, the central point of my argument anyway), the
prokaryote tree proves equally strongly that the cenancestral eubacterium is much older than α-proteobacteria.
These two compelling deductions together mean that
trees alone make it impossible to maintain both that the
root is between neomura and eubacteria and that eukaryotes are anywhere near as old as eubacteria. Thus you
must accept either or both of the statements that 'eukaryotes are much younger than eubacteria' or that 'the universal root is in eubacteria'. Both cannot be false. I think both
are true.

Comment on scenarios based on complexification
For instance: In "HslV to proteasome differentiation
polarizes the evolutionary transition, p.19, 1 paragraph"

I use this ("I argue here that the proteasome 20S core particle
evolved from the simpler HslV, not the reverse.") as a starting
point for my general questions and as a potential position
in the text to "anchor" the following comments.
Your arguments are often pretty compelling, but could
you ensure the reader that you dealt with characters for
which the complexification was indeed constant along
evolution, and not where complexification and simplification alternated due to changes in organisms way of life.
Could you ensure that two different lines of descent were
not actually existing, which evolved differentially from an
intermediate common ancestor, one line symplifying and
the other one complexifying? In this last case, the root
should be in between the two lines and not within the
simplest one.
Author's response
I do not rule this out. One obvious example is the divergence of archaebacteria and eubacteria from their neomuran cenancestor. Clearly eukaryotes became far more
complex. By contrast archaebacteria can reasonably be
inferred to have lost at least scores of genes shared by
eubacteria and eukaryotes [1], and I think more likely
around a thousand genes [108], during adaptation of
their cenancestor to hyperthermophily.

I wonder this, since you notably wrote: "It is well known
that evolution can involve simplification as well as stepwise
increases in complexity.Therefore, the fact that one can see
functional advantages in the proposed increase of complexity
from smaller and simpler HslV to larger and more complex 20S
proteasomes, though adaptively much more plausible than evolution in the reverse direction, for which no selective advantage
is apparent, is not in itself proof that evolution occurred in that
direction.", p.21. This is fair enough, but it also underlines
how the transition analyses scenarios can be somehow
fragile and dependent from our imagination to conceive
selective advantages. Practically, in most of the case, but
for the double-membranes of negibacteria, considered
primitive with respect to the simple membrane of posibacteria, you seemed to decide that the less complex stage
is the one involving a more limited structural diversity in
terms of components. How did you rule out – if you did
– that having a simpler molecular organization could not
actually correspond to a refinement, an optimization
going away from a more complex/heavy structure? If there
is no reason that there should be a unique tendency in
evolution (i.e. toward complexification all along the TOL
from the root), should we expect that living beings would
experiment different adaptations?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

In the case of the HslV, which selective advantages were
brought in by the addition of alpha and beta subunits,
each with partitioned functions only? Would not it be
conceivably potentially advantageous to loose such partitioned subunits, little operational on their own, for the
economy of the cell? Is it that counter-selected to use less
proteins with fragmentary functions to make its proteasome than to use more of these proteins? Among other different motives, you expose as a rebuttal to this kind of
reverse scenario that: "arguing that HslVU evolved from proteasomes would leave totally unanswered how 20S proteasomes
evolved. If HslV were not the ancestor of the a and beta-subunits, what is? " p.23. You are right, but why should this
ancestral candidate still be around in today's organisms,
especially if the tendency was to simplify the old structures and arguably the proteins performing the ancestral
task were less efficient? Could you tell us more about that:
is there a risk to polarize the data with a bias toward complexification or is there indeed such a genuine evolutionary tendency in prokaryotes?
Author's response
Yes there is such a risk; such mistakes have often been
made. The risk is greatest when there is a total loss of a
complex character and no trace of it having ever been
present. Cilia, flagella, photosynthesis, chloroplasts, peptidoglycan, and numerous individual enzymes have been
lost many times each; this alerts us to the necessity to
decide in each case whether loss or gain occurred. But
some characters seem on present evidence never to have
been lost, e.g. ribosomes, mitochondrial membranes, proteasomes within neomura. Thus simplification by loss,
though common, is not universal for all characters and
should not be assumed without phylogenetic evidence.
Thus for characters like TolC and TolB their presence in all
phyla of negibacteria except Hadobacteria and Chlorobacteria is most parsimoniously interpreted as reflecting their
origin after these two phyla diverged from the rest. But in
itself this is not strong evidence for their being close to the
root, because of the possibility of loss. But since the possibility of loss is immensely lower for Omp85, where loss
is lethal, its absence from Chlorobacteria is much more
likely to be ancestral than by loss. Indirectly, this gives us
increased confidence that the absence of TolC and TolB
from Chlorobacteria is the primitive state. However, simplification by total loss differs profoundly from simplification of a multigene macromolecular complex by a
reduction in the number of different subunits and merging their separate functions into a single one no larger
than either, which would have to be supposed if HslV
actually evolved from 20S core proteasomes rather than
the reverse. I am not aware of any examples where comparable simplifications of a differentiated multiprotein
macromolecular complex have actually been shown
(with solid phylogenetic evidence) to have occurred. I am

Page 72 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

not referring to the substitution of a simpler assembly for
a more complex one, e.g. of RuBisCO II in dinoflagellates
for the more complex RuBisCO I [197], but the actual
transformation of one macromolecular assembly into a
simpler homologous one. If you or any reader can give me
examples, please do. Possibly such simplification never
occurs. It should not be assumed without evidence or
precedent. I had already mentioned that expansion of the
digestion chamber volume and distancing the active centre from the exterior to reduce random digestion of the
wrong substrate is a plausible selective advantage for the
transition from HslV to proteasome rather than the
reverse for which no advantage is obvious, and which is
likely to be harmful. As there is no evidence that 20S proteasomes have ever been lost by free-living organisms, this
implies that they are a very substantial advance on HslV,
the patchy distribution of which among negibacteria suggests several losses – perhaps you might attribute it solely
to lateral gene transfer! This is a case where sequence phylogeny might help, but it sometimes yields trees where it
is very hard to distinguish between multiple losses and
multiple transfers. Because HslV loss seems relatively easy,
I give its absence from Chlorobacteria almost no weight in
rooting the tree, but as it had to evolve somewhere, and
the other evidence puts the root there, it is simpler to
assume that they never evolved it rather than lost it. The
question why should ancestral types still be around if
derived types are more efficient applies right across the
tree of life, and is not specific to proteasomes. In general
the answer must be that the derived type is better at doing
slightly different things, but the old type is better in other
niches; i.e. new adaptive zones and niches are being created/colonized. There were still niches for mesophiles
after archaebacteria became more efficient as hyperthermophiles. There were still niches for bacteria after eukaryotes evolved, for fish and algae after tetrapods and land
plants evolved, for reptiles after birds and mammals
evolved, for pteridophytes after seed plants evolved and
so on. The derived state is better in some ways and less
good in others. Remember also that an organism is a
mosaic of characters and that some have advantages in
some niches and disadvantages in others. Evolutionary
progress is not a matter of improving every thing equally.
If it were there would be only one species, not 10 million.
Probably all major transitions discussed here took place
after there were at least thousands of 'species' (I think bacteria have no real species). In each case the transition took
place in only one of them. So the new type was in most
direct competition only with its immediately ancestral,
most similar type; this may well have gone extinct through
competition, but there is no reason why this should happen to all the other thousands; it might to some. Generally in a major transition it is the intermediate stages
along the direct ancestral line that will be thus extinguished, because they are less efficient at the same thing

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

than their direct, more improved, descendants. This
explains why intermediates in quantum evolutionary
changes never survive, yet more distant primitive types
often do so. The forgoing is the fundamental explanation
of the major gaps among higher taxa that worry creationists, but allow clear-cut higher taxonomy as in Table 2,
and why evolution results in both net progress and
increased diversity. If something starts simply, as life did,
there is an inevitable tendency towards complexification
and differentiation (true in astronomy and geology too;
even the earth's inorganic crust has become more differentiated and structurally complex over time); but complexification will not be evenly spread across the tree, but can
go into reverse locally. Even random diffusion from a centre has inevitable net direction until all becomes homogeneous. But evolution never produces homogeneity and is
thus more strongly directional. Evolution does not work
by broad general steady progressive change that displaces
all phylogenetically earlier types, as in Lamarck's transformism. It is more individualistic and differentiated. Our
explanations of it must therefore be more sophisticated
than naïve uniformist transformism [131], a hint of which
is detectable in your question.
Comments about the recency of Archaea
I have some concern with this part, as I think you should
try to publish it as a separate paper, facing the possible
objections of specialists of Archaea to see if they agree or
not with this interesting idea. Personally, I have no preconceptions to locate Archaea close/far away from the
base of the tree, but I am not convinced the arguments is
truly needed here. In fact, you do not need to claim such
a recency of archaea to root your tree in the Glidobacteria,
you simply need to tell that Archaea are derived. How
derived is not so much the problem for the root, as in
doing so you complexify the paper by climbing up the tree
again, instead of going down.

This being said, on some of your figures Archaea derived
from paraphyletic actinobacteria (fig. 5, 7), while in
another one they are sister group of those actinobacteria
(fig 3). I feel that, in terms of recency, it might make a big
difference if they are sister-group to Actinobacteria, or
even at the base of the Unibacteria. Based on figure 7, I do
not really see which synapomorphies constrained the
Archaea to be higher in your tree than at the bottom of the
Unibacteria, if we adopt your current polarisation and
synapomorphies for Unibacteria, and why your neomuran revolution has too be that recent. I have thus a few
naïve questions. Would not it be appealing to put the
three revolutions you evoked closer by simply rearranging
the order of emergence of your Unibacteria? Having
slightly more early emerging Archaea than what you
claim, would lead to the suggestion that the neomuran
revolution was directly triggered by the loss of the OM, a

Page 73 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

consequence of the membranome revolution. And
indeed, you argued that there must have been some
important consequences of the unexpected increase in
thickness of the medium murein sacculus of the negibacterial membrane. What prevent us to consider that following this unique membrane transformation due to some
local environmental changes or mutation, a great period
of instability in the morphology of prokaryotes was initiated? This would be the case if Archaea were not that
recent. After all, some indirect evidence might suggest that
the archaeal fossil record could be as old as 2.8 billion
years, and I am aware of presently unpublished phylogenetic evidence in favor of a proximity between the certainly old cyanobacteria and Archaea. Also, if as you
claimed the Archaea are recent, I am curious to know what
would be according to you the selective advantage for
modern organisms to evolve toward a relatively little efficient metabolism such as methanogenesis? By contrast, if
Archaea are older than what you said, say at least at the
base of Unibacteria, they might have been happy ancient
methanogens, as they evolved this metabolism at a time
where the atmosphere was still not that oxygenic.
Author's response
The arguments for the recency of archaebacteria are published in more detail in a parallel paper [129], but still
need including briefly here. I estimated the age of methanogenesis there as ~720 My. The most recent evolutionary
review by an archaebacterial specialist [198] is agnostic
about their age, but argues that methanogenesis is
younger than archaebacteria. In principle the apparently
late origin of a process can be attributed to lack of selective
advantage, lack of suitable phylogenetic precursors, or its
inherent mutational/mechanistic difficulty. I do not know
which was most important for methanogenesis or why
eubacteria never evolved it, even though some had several
precursor enzymes and coenzymes. Methanogenesis is
most likely to have evolved in an anaerobic place where
there were high concentrations of both hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Such a niche could have been created by
early protozoa with hydrogenosomes (necessarily late),
by a variety of eubacteria (various ages) or inorganically
(potentially very early), so evolutionary difficulties seem
likely. If the ancestors of methanogens were hyperthermophilic and sulphur-compound-dependent anaerobic
respirers [1], it could be that, as many hot acid environments are very poor in organic matter and not all would
have appropriate sulphur compounds, there was a strong
selective premium for evolving novel forms of chemoautotrophy even if relatively inefficient; perhaps archaebacteria were best placed by their hyperthermophily to
invade that niche and mesophilic methanogens evolved,
relatively more easily, later [1]. I think it likely that until
archaebacteria evolved there were no hyperthermophiles
on earth, and these niches were unexploited. This might

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

help to explain why eubacteria never evolved methanogenesis; probably Aquifex and Thermotoga only became
hyperthermophiles after they got facilitating genes from
archaebacteria. For the reasons discussed in [129] and
also in this paper, I think it most likely that Actinobacteria
are paraphyletic (Figs 5, 7) and that neomura are sisters of
or nested within Actinomycetales alone, rather than sisters of Actinobacteria as a whole, the deepest position that
seems reasonably compatible with the data. But as the evidence against their holophyly is not decisive, because of
the (less parsimonious) possibility of eukaryote-like character losses by deeper branching actinobacterial lineages,
I originally showed them as holophyletic in Fig. 4 to
emphasize that we should not yet totally reject that possibility, but have now changed this for consistency with the
other figures. As I explained in [129], the question of the
paraphyly or holophyly of Actinobacteria (and similarly
of Endobacteria and Eurybacteria, also both arguable
either way) is indeed important for the timing of several
evolutionary events, notably the origins of Posibacteria,
Endobacteria, and Actinobacteria. But for the reasons
given there and in [1] I think it very improbable that
archaebacteria can be substantially older than eukaryotes,
and unlikely that they can be as old as posibacteria. But to
my mind the larger uncertainty is not the age of archaebacteria, but that of Actinobacteria and Endobacteria;
compared with my earlier paper [1], which regarded them
both as approximately as old as most negibacterial phyla,
my recent analysis tentatively suggests that both are much
younger, with actinobacteria probably being still younger
than endobacteria [129]. This revised interpretation
greatly reduces the huge time-lag originally envisaged
between the origin of Posibacteria and neomura [1],
though not nearly as much as you suggest. We need
group-specific palaeobiomarkers to test these inferences,
and your, I think less likely, proposition.
Additional punctual questions about your scenarios
- For the proteasome evolution: how do we know it is
easier to go from 6 to 7 fold symmetry?
Author's response
We don't. My argument is that the key selective advantage
was expansion of the digestion chamber volume and associated reduction in accessibility of the proteolytic site to
false substrates. Though 7-fold symmetry would slightly
widen the chamber compared with 6-fold symmetry,
probably more important was its doubling in length by
differentiation into two subunits, the inner proteolytic
and the outer not, and doubling the number of rings, thus
greatly distancing the active sites from the entry pores.
Reversing that would be harmful and mechanistically
much harder. Possibly the 7-fold symmetry was an indirect consequence of either the novel interactions between

Page 74 of 83

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

the two paralogous subunits or of the novel interaction
with a different ATPase cap.
- For the loss of the OM: you wrote p.29 :"the negibacterial
double envelope is so complex that it must have arisen only
once". Why not, but did the eye, that is so complex, arise
once only? Is the "complexity" argument that compelling?
With your strong knowledge of morphology could you
tell us how complex are the most impressive cases of convergence within prokaryotes you could think of?
Author's response
Talking about 'the eye' is wrong. Even though the molecular receptors are homologous as are some genes involved
in eye development, eyes in different phyla, e.g. vertebrate
eyes, arthropod compound eyes and cephalopod eyes, are
structurally non-homologous with each other but homologous in detailed structure within phyla. Thus the particular structure of the vertebrate eye did evolve only once, as
did that of the arthropod compound eye, but eyes in general are polyphyletic. Likewise the negibacterial double
envelope is not homologous in composition or detailed
structure with the so-called double membrane of the
archaebacterium Ignicoccus. Thus a uniform pattern of
complexity indicates a common origin and a different pattern of complexity a separate origin: in both eyes and bacterial envelopes. Though too little is yet known of the
detailed biogenesis and modes of lipid transfer to the
outer membrane/sheath of either, I predict that they will
be different; there is no evidence for the negibacterial type
of close membrane contact/adhesion as at Bayer's patches
or porin/β-barrel OM proteins or lipoproteins in the Ignicoccus envelope, quite apart from the lipids being entirely
different and no evidence for lipid differentiation between
the CM and outer sheath. The tentative indications that
vesicle budding is involved and the several fold greater
'periplasmic' volume compared with the cytoplasm is radically different from in negibacteria; if vesicle budding is
involved, the Ignicoccus outer sheath may be more analogous to the secreted vitelline membrane of animal eggs or
the secreted lipid liner of nematode eggshells than to the
negibacterial OM. The fact that a known second origin of
an outer 'membrane' is so utterly different in detail from
the structurally very uniform negibacterial envelope
strongly reinforces the likelihood of a single origin only
for the latter; thus it strengthens my case, rather than
weakens it as is sometimes wrongly claimed. On bacterial
convergence, perhaps the eubacterial and archaebacterial
flagella are the most impressive case, but when sequences
became available they were readily recognized as such.

- You exposed both how mechanically easy and how historically difficult it is to loose the OM and concluded that
: "As discussed below, all posibacteria have related machinery
for achieving this, which establishes their monophyly. ", p.31.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

Yet, if loosing the OM is not that difficult mechanically,
this argument is in fact arguable and the monophyly
could be a bias against convergence. In term of parcimony, is the call for two independent losses of OM in all
the history of all life much different anyway from the
claim of one single loss? Both solutions seem quite parcimonious to me. For this reason, would you have any independent evidence/synapomorphy for the posibacteria/
Unibacteria to support the conviction that the loss of OM
happened only once? (This send us back to the general
question of the independent definition of the clades, see
above)
Author's response
A good comment on OM loss: I have inserted an explanation that, though losing the OM by murein hypertrophy
would be mechanically easy, the survival of such a cell
would be impaired as hypertrophy would probably drastically interfere with division, and the likely necessity of
coevolving modifications to cell division could have
made the evolutionary transition very difficult indeed and
thus unlikely to be repeated. A synapomorphy for unibacteria plus Thermotoga is sn-glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (G1PDH) [18], close to your request, given that
Thermotoga is not excluded from being sister to Posibacteria (this example was already given in the paper). But one
does not need a single universal synapomorphy to
exclude the convergence you suggest. Two overlapping
partial synapomorphies can do that. In this case sortases
and proteasomes. One sortase gene family is a synapomorphy for Posibacteria, indicating that Actinobacteria
and Endobacteria did not lose the OM independently
(this synapomorphy was necessarily lost during the
neomuran revolution with the loss of peptidoglycan and
thus is not universal in unimembranous organisms:
unimembrana [129]). Proteasomes are synapomorphies
for neomura and Actinomycetales, indicating that they
did not lose the OM independently. Taken together they
refute independent OM loss by archaebacteria and Posibacteria. A third partial synapomorphy (the acyl ester
phosphatidylinositol) links eukaryotes and Actinobacteria, showing that they did not lose the OM independently.
In conjunction with the 20 synapomorphies linking all
neomura this is further independent evidence that archaebacteria and Posibacteria did not lose the OM separately.

- For the evidence based on the L-ring/V-ring proteins
Phylogenetic trees of these proteins would help to decide
if they can or cannot easily be transferred by LGT, especially for Aquifex and Thermotoga, before being taken as
evidence for a vertical history. Could you tell us more
about this?

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

Author's response
It might, but I doubt it for the reasons given in my
response to Referee 2. But if you think so, do it yourself.

- About the Chlorobacteria
In the figures legend, you acknowledged that this group
might not be monophyletic, but in the main text you simply stated that "Chlorobacteria [1]comprise filamentous 'nonsulphur' green bacteria, e.g. Chloroflexus, Oscillochloris, Chloronema and Heliothrix, which can be photoheterotrophs or photoautotrophs; colourless heterotrophs, including thermophiles
(e.g. Thermomicrobium, Herpetosiphon); and chlororespirers
(Dehalococcoides)", p.64. Would you know how many
published trees support or reject this grouping? Do we
have a priori phylogenetic reasons to believe/not to
believe in its monophyly?
Author's response
I did not say that they 'might not be monophyletic'. The
only trees with good taxon sampling for this group are 16S
rRNA trees and all show them as robustly monophyletic.
I said they might be paraphyletic, which in the classical
and proper nomenclature that I use is a form a monophyly [69]. Sequence trees are unrooted and thus useless
to distinguish between chlorobacteria being paraphyletic
or holophyletic. We need cladistic/transition analysis for
robust characters that vary within the group to determine
whether the root of the tree is within or beside Chlorobacteria.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

tein tree failed to do so robustly [175]. Whatever the
results we could neither be sure that it is safe to use the
protein as I have or unsafe to do so. My logical reasoning
is therefore independent of how closely the Omp85 tree
matches Fig. 7. A sequence tree could be positively misleading if it were considered to be relevant. A tree would
be interesting (a) to see how much sensible evolutionary
information Omp85 sequences contain, and (b) whether
there is any clear evidence for lateral transfer, but not for
evaluating the 'safeness' of my argument. All that matters
is whether it is right or wrong and the tree will not tell us.
But please make one if you are sufficiently interested in
the outcome
- About the ancestral complex membrane
It seems to me that regarding the origin of the negibacterial membrane, you pushed the difficulty further back in
the past. It is thus difficult to evaluate if your scenario is
truly parcimonious for this polarisation. Where does the
ancestral negibacterial with its outer membrane come
from? Was there ever a transition from one membrane to
two membranes before LUCA?
Author's response
I think there was and that this transition marked the origin of the first cell; I explained this and how the OM may
originally have evolved in detail in [31].

- About the limited impact of short term adaptation on
long term phylogeny

- About Omp85
Your arguments are very interesting. Yet, it would be interesting to dispose of an Omp85 tree to see if its phylogenetic history matches the one of your proposed Tree of
Life. This would confirm that this marker can be safely
used to reason about this problem.
Author's response
I do not agree. It is theoretically possible for Omp85 to
have been laterally transferred from one phylum to
another that already had it and then to replace the existing
version. A tree that accurately represented that transfer
would then have the wrong topology, and thus not match
my proposed tree of life. But it would be entirely wrong to
conclude from it that my Omp85 argument is unreliable.
Making a tree would also fail to discriminate between my
argument that absence in Chlorobacteria is primitive and
the theoretical possibility (the only thing that if it were
true would invalidate my argument) that their common
ancestor lost it. Thirdly it is highly unlikely that any single
gene, whether Omp85 or anything else contains enough
conserved information to correctly and robustly reconstruct the negibacterial radiation. Even the recent 31-pro-

p. 106, you claim that "many lateral transfers seem more
important for short term adaptation than for long-term phylogeny", but I do not see why these events, even if punctual,
would not strongly reshape the long term phylogeny.
After all, in your paper, is not the loss of the OM one of
this short term adaptation with huge taxonomical consequences?
Author's response
Loss of the OM was neither short-term nor necessarily
adaptive. I said that many transfers seem of short-term significance, e.g. because many less-core genes seem to come
and go. I did not say that no lateral gene transfers have
long-term significance. Surely it would be ridiculous to
claim that all lateral transfers shape long-term phylogeny.
Evolution is not homogeneous in rates, magnitude or persistence of effects with respect to the different genes of the
organism, but highly heterogeneous or mosaic [129]; why
should lateral transfer be any different in this respect from
mutations? I slightly extended this discussion by using the
example of cyanobacteria to make my meaning clearer.

To the reader:
Abstract, Background, first paragraph.
TCS considers the root of the tree of life as "the most difficult problems in phylogeny". Interestingly, Laporte in his
".Laporte, J. 2005. Is There a Single Objective, Evolutionary Tree of Life? Journal of Philosophy CII: 357–374.",
recently argued along a different line, establishing that
even at the smallest scale polarizing a phylogeny is incredibly problematic. This is also consistent with TCS later
claims in this paper that "establishing the root of a small part
of the tree is more straightforward, yet often surprisingly difficult for organisms without plentiful fossils", (p.3, background,
first paragraph.)
Author's response
Saying that polarizing phylogeny is 'incredibly difficult' is
an exaggeration, but not one that in any way contradicts
my assertion that positioning the root and establishing
the properties of the most ancient cells is the most difficult phylogenetic problem. But I prefer to solve a problem
rather that to philosophize about why it is difficult.
In "The primacy of transition analysis, p.6, 4 paragraph"
"Search for congruence among multiple lines of evidence – the
more diverse the better and resolving apparent contradictions by
weighing up the evidence is not special to evolutionary biology
but fundamental to all science." I think this is arguable. In a
paper to be published soon in Philosophy and Biology, G.
McOuat illustrates how eastern science can go for a different objective: highlighting conflict and incongruence as
major features of scientific knowledge instead of stressing
on congruence. K. Popper stressed on falsification not
confirmation to realize scientific progress. T. Kuhn and P.
Feyerabend would also argue that, deeply, science does
not proceed so much by confirmation, but more by revolutions and shifts.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

both refutation and confirmation have a role. Popper's
emphasis on refutation and denial of the validity of scientific proof (in contrast to mathematical proof) stems from
his obsession with general theories. But phylogeny is particular and historical not general. That reptiles were ancestral to birds and mammals, or prokaryotes were ancestral
to eukaryotes are not general theories, but specific suggestions that specific unique historical events actually happened. For unique historical events, particular pieces of
evidence can logically confirm or prove a particular happening; Popper's argument for the logical asymmetry of
proof and disproof relates only to general/universal theories, where single novel instances may disprove previously
well-corroborated and accepted general theories. But for
historical events if we have sufficient information we can
prove some things beyond question, such as what were
the historical ancestors of a new allopolyploid species like
Primula kewensis or that Queen Victoria existed and who
her children were.
p. 107: TCS considers ref [162] as unduly pessimistic. As
one of its author, I feel that many of the conceptual problems listed in this reference (diaphonia, criterion evaluation, circular reasoning and palaisma) are still present,
even in TCS admirable work. In terms of optimism/pessimism, future studies will tell if the congruence defended
in the present transition analyses, a major progress for the
debate about the tree of life, can be considered as the solution or if the debate will keep going on. I bet it will.
Author's response
I do not think my reasoning circular, and you have not
pointed out anything specifically that is. Your final prediction is historically solidly based: there are still flatearthers, creationists, and people who believe in fairies.

Minor comments:
To the author.

Author's response
Anything is arguable if you are sufficiently philosophically inclined. Congruence and incongruence are two
inseparable sides of a coin. I have little respect for Feyerabend's approach, but think that a realistic appreciation
on how science actually progresses involves elements of
both Popper's and Kuhn's perspectives, which are not as
contradictory as you imply. Thus, using Kuhnian language, we could call the shift, which I hope is underway,
of considering the root to be between neomura and
eubacteria to accepting it among negibacteria a paradigm
shift, because it affects our perspectives in so many ways
and also meets the usual intense resistance associated
with such a major shift. But the proper way to effect such
a shift is not philosophic discussion but by evaluating the
evidence critically and in detail. In evolutionary biology

In "The primacy of transition analysis, first paragraph"
It is not common practice in cladistics to use a grade. I do
not mind it, but I do not know if cladists would enjoy
your example of "reptiles", and give you their full support
there.
Author's response
Cladistic reasoning in phylogeny, which I use and highly
value (in that sense I am a cladist), actually 'uses' both
clades and grades when referring to ancestral and derived
conditions. What you mean is that some cladists hate paraphyletic groups in formal taxonomy. As explained elsewhere [69], I think all reasons they have given for this
aversion are scientifically unsound; they reflect confusion
between the purposes of phylogeny and taxonomy. But

Page 77 of 83
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:19

the validity of my reptile example is entirely independent
of whether you wish to classify reptiles as a taxon (as I
would) or not (which some, not all, cladists prefer).
In "Paralogue rooting failed clearly to root the tree"
You don't have to, but you might be willing to comment
on Zhaxybayeva O, Lapierre P, Gogarten JP., Ancient gene
duplications and the root(s) of the tree of life., Protoplasma. 2005 Dec;227(1):53–64. Epub 2005 Dec 30.
Author's response
This paper [116] by one of the original inventors of paralogue rooting agrees with me that it has not solved the
problem. They made trees for 17 universal paralogue
pairs; nine put the root between archaebacteria and
eubacteria; seven put it within eubacteria (which I consider correct) and one put it within archaebacteria. They
explicitly recognized that all trees showing the root
between neomura and eubacteria could be affected by
long-branch artefacts, as I earlier suggested [1]. As I had
[1], they draw attention to the fact that the insertion in the
neomuran catalytic subunit only of the vacuolar type
ATPase strongly indicates that the neomuran state is
derived compared with the eubacterial state. As I also
pointed out [1], this polarizes the tree from the eubacterial state to the neomuran state for this enzyme. This
polarization clearly contradicts the rooting shown by the
tree itself, which is between neomura and eubacteria.
Thus the same molecule gives two contradictory answers
depending whether you use tree rooting logic (necessarily
subject to long-branch artefacts) or discrete character
molecular cladistic/polarization logic (unaffected by long
branching). I think the only reasonable way of resolving
this contradiction is to accept that the tree is misrooted by
extremely severe long-branch attraction, exactly as I
explained before [1] (those long bare stems stick out like
a sore thumb) and that the polarization by the insertion
from eubacteria to neomura is correct; thus eubacteria are
ancestral to neomura. However only four of the other
eight enzymes showing the root between archaebacteria
and eubacteria, rather than within eubacteria, are ribosome- or transcription-related, which I argued should have
been subject to strong quantum evolution [1] specifically
in the ancestral neomuran. But there is no reason why
some other proteins should not have similar long-branch
problems, as many paralogues are deeply divergent and
thus have a highly stretched stem on paralogue trees.
These new conflicting results among different paralogues
reinforce the necessity of using transition polarization to
resolve the conflict.
In "HslV to proteasome differentiation polarizes the evolutionary
transition, 7 paragraph, p.23"
To conclude your scenario about HslV evolution, you say
that "Thus mechanistic, selective, and ***phylogenetic***

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/19

arguments all unambiguously polarize the direction of evolution". You should remove "phylogenetic". I do not think it
is tested, since it is not possible to do a phylogenetic tree
with HslV, the alpha and the beta subunits, as you
explained after, p. 25, 2nd paragraph.
Author's response
I disagree. You construe 'phylogenetic' too narrowly. The
term was invented a century before anyone did sequence
trees or invented electronic computers. There is much
phylogenetic evidence other than sequence trees; phylogenetic arguments entirely independent of sequence trees
can often be stronger than the conclusions of a sequence
tree.

The notion of "monophyletic grade" is unknown to me
(p. 76). You could rephrase that for people with a cladist
eye.
Author's response
The meaning should be obvious. Grades can be ancestral
or derived. Some grades are monophyletic (either paraphyletic, like prokaryotes or fish, or holophyletic, like
tetrapods) others are polyphyletic (like testate amoebae or
legless reptiles). The former are acceptable as taxa, the latter are not; some with a 'cladist's eye' have almost forgotten the important distinction between paraphyly and
polyphyly and lump both as 'non-monophyletic'. Classically [189], and to me, monophyly includes both paraphyly and holophyly [69]; it originated to contrast with
polyphyly. Using all four terms appropriately is more precise and informative than using just two: 'monophyletic'
sensu Hennig (= holophyletic) and 'non-monophyletic'
(sensu many cladists = paraphyletic plus polyphyletic). By
attempting to change monophyly to mean holophyly
alone Hennig destroyed its original purpose [189], sowing
immense confusion (two conflicting meanings now for
monophyly) that still haunts us.
