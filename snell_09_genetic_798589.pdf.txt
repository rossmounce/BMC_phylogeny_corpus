Abstract
Background: Mate choice is of central importance to most animals, influencing population structure, speciation, and
ultimately the survival of a species. Mating behavior of male brachionid rotifers is triggered by the product of a
chemosensory gene, a glycoprotein on the body surface of females called the mate recognition pheromone. The mate
recognition pheromone has been biochemically characterized, but little was known about the gene(s). We describe the
isolation and characterization of the mate recognition pheromone gene through protein purification, N-terminal amino
acid sequence determination, identification of the mate recognition pheromone gene from a cDNA library, sequencing,
and RNAi knockdown to confirm the functional role of the mate recognition pheromone gene in rotifer mating.
Results: A 29 kD protein capable of eliciting rotifer male circling was isolated by high-performance liquid
chromatography. Two transcript types containing the N-terminal sequence were identified in a cDNA library; further
characterization by screening a genomic library and by polymerase chain reaction revealed two genes belonging to each
type. Each gene begins with a signal peptide region followed by nearly perfect repeats of an 87 to 92 codon motif with
no codons between repeats and the final motif prematurely terminated by the stop codon. The two Type A genes contain
four and seven repeats and the two Type B genes contain three and five repeats, respectively. Only the Type B gene with
three repeats encodes a peptide with a molecular weight of 29 kD. Each repeat of the Type B gene products contains
three asparagines as potential sites for N-glycosylation; there are no asparagines in the Type A genes. RNAi with Type
A double-stranded RNA did not result in less circling than in the phosphate-buffered saline control, but transfection with
Type B double-stranded RNA significantly reduced male circling by 17%. The very low divergence between repeat units,
even at synonymous positions, suggests that the repeats are kept nearly identical through a process of concerted
evolution. Information-rich molecules like surface glycoproteins are well adapted for chemical communication and
aquatic animals may have evolved signaling systems based on these compounds, whereas insects use cuticular
hydrocarbons.
Conclusion: Owing to its critical role in mating, the mate recognition pheromone gene will be a useful molecular marker
for exploring the mechanisms and rates of selection and the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation using
rotifers as a model system. The phylogenetic variation in the mate recognition pheromone gene can now be studied in
conjunction with the large amount of ecological and population genetic data being gathered for the Brachionus plicatilis
species complex to understand better the evolutionary drivers of cryptic speciation.

Background
One of the most important decisions in the life of animals
is mate choice, which includes discrimination of conspecifics, avoidance of inbreeding, and identification of disease-free, high fitness genotypes. In many animals,
pheromones are used to communicate information about
the sex, age, and fitness of potential mates [1], and a wide
variety of molecules are used to regulate life history transitions [2]. Much is known about mate choice behavior,
but little is known about the genes controlling this behavior [3]. Recent work has elucidated some chemosensory
genes involved in mate choice and how genetic variation
in sensory genes influences mate discrimination. Comparative genomics has shown that genes involved in mate
choice typically are highly polymorphic and arise through
gene duplication, then are co-opted for mate choice [3].
Reproductive genes often are rapidly evolving and exhibit
the signature of positive selection [4].
Brachionid rotifers exhibit mate choice [5-8]. They are
capable of both sexual (mixis) and asexual reproduction,
where mixis is triggered by a quorum sensing process [9].
If unfertilized, mictic females produce haploid males that
are fast swimmers and do not feed [10]. Upon encountering a female, a male exhibits a distinctive mating behavior
that consists of tight circling around the female while
maintaining contact with his corona and penis. The
moment of male-female encounter is critical because this
is when a male makes the key decision of whether or not
to mate. Male mate recognition is based upon the mate
recognition pheromone (MRP), a glycoprotein that is
located on the body surface of females [11]. Biochemical
properties of the MRP from Brachionus manjavacas have
been characterized [11-14]. The species B. manjavacas is a
recently named clade [15] from the B. plicatilis species
complex [16] and it was formerly known as B. plicatilis
Russian. MRP can be removed by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatment and transferred to the
body surface of conspecific or heterospecific females [17].
Males are thought to detect the MRP signal by contact
chemoreception through a receptor in their corona. Males
are capable of discriminating conspecifics by geographic
origin, sex, and female age [5,7,10,11,18,19], demonstrating a preference for young conspecific females [8,19]. The
basis of this choosy mating behavior of males is female
MRP signal quality and strength, which in turn determines male mating persistence and circling intensity. Similar male mate choice has been observed in other rotifer
species, including Brachionus calyciflorus [5,6], Asplanchna
brightwelli [20], and Epiphanes senta [21]. Females also can
exhibit mate choice by varying their resistance to male circling [8].
The MRP likely is a critically important molecule in the
establishment and maintenance of reproductive isolation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/60

among rotifer species [10]. Knowledge of the amount and
pattern of variation at both the nucleotide and amino acid
levels in natural populations would provide insight into
the type and intensity of selection acting on mating barriers. The rate of evolution of reproductive proteins is
known to be generally faster than for other proteins [4],
but the reason for this is not clear. The evolutionary
dynamics of mate recognition genes, their comparative
divergence in sympatry and allopatry, and their divergence with local adaptation, remain a mystery. Explaining
the abundance of cryptic species in rotifers and how morphologically similar species can coexist and maintain
their species integrity also remains a challenge.
A key to answering these questions is the identification
and characterization of the MRP gene and developing a
hypothesis of its evolution. In this paper, we report on isolation of the MRP protein and determination of its N-terminal sequence. We used the N-terminal sequence to
identify from genomic and cDNA a family of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins, which have various
numbers of MRP motif repeats. The predicted protein
product of one of these genes, designated MMR-B3, has
the biochemical properties expected of the MRP, and we
used RNAi to validate the functional role of MMR-B3 as
the MRP gene in rotifer mating.

Methods
Rotifer culture
The strain of Brachionus manjavacas [15] was originally
collected from the Azov Sea [13] and formerly known as
B. plicatilis Russian [22]. It is part of the Manjavacas clade
as defined by phylogenetic analysis of COI and ITS genes
[7,16,23]. This strain has been cultured continuously in
the laboratory since 1983, with periodic collection and
storage of resting eggs. Methods for rotifer culture, isolation of males, and hatching of diapausing embryos (resting eggs) followed Snell et al. [8].
Purification and amino acid sequencing of MRP
Approximately 40 to 50 g wet-weight rotifer biomass was
filtered from 250 liter mass cultures fed the green alga Tetraselmis suecica. Isolation of protein followed the EDTA
extraction protocol of Snell and Stelzer [17]. Extracted
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, following the
methods of Snell and Stelzer [17], and visualized with
Sypro Orange protein gel stain (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The detection limit for this stain is about 25 ng. Ionexchange fractions capable of eliciting male mating reactions eluted from the column at 21 to 23 minutes [17],
and were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatography as described in Snell et
al. [22]. Edman N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 29
kD protein band from the 17 minute HPLC fraction was

determined by the Emory University microsequencing
facility from a Western blot of a PAGE gel. Sequencing
yielded a 0.7 pmol signal for the 29 kD protein.
Isolation and sequencing of the gene encoding MRP
The N-terminal amino acid sequence was used to screen
an existing B. manjavacas cDNA library (Mark Welch et al.,
in prep) using TBLASTN. Two contigs were identified with
translated open reading frames containing close matches
to the N-terminal sequence of the 29 kD band (see
Results). As both contigs contained repeats of a conserved
motif we designated these candidate MRP genes MRP
Motif Repeat A (MMR-A) and B (MMR-B). Primers based
on the 5'- and 3'-ends of putative MRP transcripts were
used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of B. manjavacas
cDNA and genomic DNA (Table 1). To extract genomic
DNA or construct cDNA, B. manjavacas was collected on a
sterile 40 Î¼m Nitex mesh, rinsed with 15 ppt artificial sea-

water (ASW) followed by deionized water, and pipetted
into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. The rotifers were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was aspirated.
Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and
Tissue kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA construction, total RNA was extracted
with the RNAqueousÂ®-Micro kit (Ambion, Austin, TX,
USA), and cDNA was synthesized following the FirstChoiceÂ® RLM-RACE kit (Ambion), except that mRNA was
reverse transcribed with Superscript IIâ¢ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) primed with the
polyT containing oligonucleotide CDSIII (BD Bioscience,
San Jose, CA, USA) to favor full-length transcripts.
Amplifications for MMR-A were performed in 50 Î¼l reactions containing 100 ng cDNA or 500 ng genomic DNA,
0.2 Î¼M each primer (Table 1), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 0.75 M
betaine, 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Qiagen), and 5 Î¼l Ã10

buffer (Qiagen). PCR conditions were 1 minute at 94Â°C
followed by 35 cycles of 15 seconds at 94Â°C; 30 seconds
at Ta; 120 seconds at 72Â°C followed by 7 minutes at 72Â°C,
where Ta was 45Â°C, 48Â°C, 52Â°C or 55Â°C. Amplifications
for MMR-B were performed in 25 Î¼l reactions containing
1Ã TopTaq Reaction Buffer (Qiagen), 50 ng genomic
DNA, 200 Î¼M dNTPs, 0.4 Î¼M each primer, and 1 U
TopTaq (Qiagen). PCR conditions were 4 minutes at
94Â°C, followed by 27 cycles of 30 seconds at 50Â°C, 20
seconds at 50Â°C, and 2 minutes at 72Â°C, followed by 7
minutes at 72Â°C.
Amplification products were visualized on agarose gels,
extracted using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen),
ligated into pCR4-TOPO using the TA-cloning reaction,
and transformed into Escherichia coli Top10 cells following the supplier's protocol (Invitrogen). Plasmids were
extracted from positive clones and sequenced in both
directions using standard M13 forward and reverse primers with ABI Big Dye 3.1 chemistry on an ABI 3730 Ã l
Genetic Analyzer. The sequences were edited and assembled using PHRED, CROSSMATCH, and PHRAP[24] as previously described [25] or using Sequencher 4.6 (GeneCodes
Corporation).
As two of the candidate MRP genes could not be reliably
assembled from forward and reverse reads of the PCR
products due to their length and repeat structure, we constructed a B. manjavacas fosmid genomic library using
standard methods as previously described [26] and
probed membranes representing about a 2-fold genome
coverage using a 32P-labeled portion of MRP candidate
gene MMR-A4 (4 indicating the number of repetitive
motifs within the sequence). A positive fosmid was subcloned by shearing the fosmid DNA to about 3 kb fragments by nebulization, repairing the ends by extension
with Taq polymerase, and ligating the repaired fragments
into pCR4-TOPO. Plasmid clones were sequenced as
described above. Due to the repetitive nature of the MRP
candidate genes the sequences were assembled by hand
using Sequencher 4.6. To resolve a large repeat region, the
2.1 kb insert of a sub-clone containing the entire region
with 100 to 150 base pairs (bp) of flanking DNA was
excised from pCR4-TOPO with EcoRI (which does not cut
in the insert), eluted on an agarose gel and extracted with
a MinElute column. The purified insert was partially
digested with RsaI, a blunt cutter that cuts once in each
repeat (500 ng purified DNA; 0.2 U RsaI; 1Ã New England
Biolabs Buffer 1 for 5 minutes at 37Â°C). Digestion products were eluted on an agarose gel, extracted with a MinElute column, phosphatased using Shrimp Alkaline
Phosphatase (USB, Cleveland, OH, USA) for 60 minutes
at 37Â°C, and cloned into pCR4-TOPO as described above.
The insert sizes of 96 clones were checked by digestion
with EcoRI and 43 were sequenced and assembled using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/60

the non-repetitive flanking sequences as guides. This
resulted in an unambiguous assembly with 28Ã average
read coverage and no bp disagreements. Sequences were
analyzed using the EMBOSS suite [27] and DnaSP [28].
Signal peptides were detected using SIGNALP[29], which
predicts the presence of an N-terminal peptide sequence
that signals for secretion, and the peptidase I cleavage site
that removes the peptide, using hidden Markov models
and neural networks based on known signal peptide
sequences.
Synthesis of double-stranded RNA
Plasmids containing MMR-A or MMR-B genes were used
as templates for double-stranded (dsRNA) synthesis. The
MMR-A4 plasmid insert originated from PCR amplification from fosmid DNA. The MMR-A7 insert was a subclone of a fosmid. The MMR-B3 insert was derived from a
PCR product from genomic DNA. Due to the repetitive
motifs in the putative MRP genes, primers were designed
to the pCR4-TOPO vector (Table 1) and used to amplify a
single product containing MMR-A7 or MMR-B3 flanked
by around 80 vector nucleotides at the 5'- and 3'-ends.
GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase isoform 1 (referred to as
'MAN' throughout) was amplified from genomic B. manjavacas DNA using primers from Snell et al. (Snell TW,
Shearer TL, Smith HA: Exposure to dsRNA produces RNA
interference in Brachionus manjavacas (Rotifera). BMC
Genomics, submitted) (Table 1).

MRP and MAN PCR amplifications were performed in 10
Î¼l volume solutions with 10 to 50 ng plasmid DNA
(MMR-A7 and MMR-B3) or genomic DNA (MAN), 0.2 U
Taq DNA polymerase and a final concentration of 0.2 mM
of each dNTP, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl,
0.001% gelatin, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 Î¼M vector-specific (MMR-A7 and MMR-B3) or gene-specific primers
(Table 1). Thermal cycling conditions consisted of 95Â°C
for 2 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, 50Â°C for 90 seconds, 72Â°C for 90 seconds. PCR
amplicons were gel-extracted using the QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen).
Gel-extracted PCR products were used as template (1 Î¼l)
for a subsequent PCR using vector-specific (MMR-A7 and
MMR-B3) or gene-specific (MAN) primers with T7 bacterial promoter sequence at the 5'-end of each primer (Table
1). PCR amplification conditions were the same as above.
Products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel, and gelextracted using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen).
dsRNA of the candidate MRP and MAN genes and synthesized by in vivo transcription in 33 Î¼l reactions following
a modification of Piano et al. [30]. Reactions consisted of

NTPs, 4.53 mM DTT, 12.1 mM Tris (pH 7.9), 1.8 mM

MgCl2, 0.6 mM spermidine, 3.0 mM NaCl, and 90 U T7
RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and were
incubated at 37Â°C for 4 hours. The product was ethanol
precipitated and purified dsRNA was re-suspended in 5 Î¼l
sterile, RNase-free water. To minimize degradation of the
dsRNA, RNAi experiments were conducted within 48
hours of dsRNA production.
To confirm that the transcribed dsRNA was from MMR-A7
and MMR-B3, PCR products from the MMR-A7 and MMRB3 PCR using the T7 primers were cloned using a TOPO
TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions using M13 primers (Nevada Genomics, Reno, NV,
USA). Sequences were aligned with MMR-A and MMR-B
cDNA sequences using BioEdit v7.0.5 [31], confirming
the dsRNA used in RNAi experiments was from the MMR
genes (data not shown).
Transfection protocol
Diapausing embryos were decapsulated and transfected
with dsRNA following the double transfection technique
of Snell et al. (Snell TW, Shearer TL, Smith HA: Exposure
to dsRNA produces RNA interference in Brachionus manjavacas (Rotifera). BMC Genomics, submitted). For the resting egg and the subsequent feeding transfection, 10 to 50
ng dsRNA was resuspended in 5 Î¼l water. Mating bioassays were performed on maternal females approximately 24 hours following the feeding transfection.
Mating bioassay
Resting egg hatchlings are all females and were collected
under a stereomicroscope at 10Ã magnification using a
narrow bore glass micropipette. Males were filtered from
a 5 to 7-day-old 200 ml culture using a 68 Î¼m mesh pore
size Nitex screen and re-suspended in ASW of the same
salinity as the culture (12 to 16 ppt). Only vigorous, fast
swimming males (ages unknown) were isolated and
mated with the treated females. The mating bioassay was
performed by placing seven males and one female into
about 50 Î¼l of ASW on a microscope slide printed with 10
spots. Mating behavior was observed for 3 minutes on a
video monitor at 10Ã magnification using a CCD camera.
The number of male-female encounters and the number
of matings initiated (circlings) by males were recorded
using 6 to 12 replicate females for each treatment. The
number of encounters and circlings of males with control
females, and with females exposed to a variety of HPLC
fractions (described below) or dsRNA transfections of
MMR-A7 and MMR-B3, were compared. To determine
synergistic effects of MMR-A7 and MMR-B3 knockdown, a
transfection was performed in which MMR-A7 and MMRB3 at half dosages were together complexed with the lipofection reagent (Snell TW, Shearer TL, Smith HA: Exposure
to dsRNA produces RNA interference in Brachionus manja-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/60

vacas (Rotifera). BMC Genomics, submitted), for a total
quantity of dsRNA similar to MMR-A7 or MMR-B3 alone.
A variation on the mating bioassay was used to test the
ability of the HPLC fractions to elicit male mating reactions. Rotifer females were exposed to 50 mM EDTA then
washed following Snell and Stelzer [17] to strip off their
surface glycoproteins, making them receptive to binding
of exogenous proteins. Females treated with EDTA were
exposed to HPLC protein fractions to test the ability of
each fraction to elicit male mating. Exposure of six to eight
EDTA-treated females was performed using the protocol
for treatment with ion-exchange fractions described in
Snell and Stelzer [17]; control females were exposed to
EDTA but not treated with protein fractions.
The null hypothesis tested in the mating bioassays was
that the frequency of circling is independent of the treatments, which were an HPLC fraction or a dsRNA transfection. For RNAi assays, controls consisted of females
transfected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in place
of dsRNA; PBS is a reagent in the transfection solution. A
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared circling
of control and treated females [32]. The probability of
male circling of 6 to 12 replicate females was recorded for
each treatment. An ANOVA was performed on raw and
arcsine transformed data. Since there was virtually no difference in the ANOVA values, we present results for the
untransformed data.

Results
HPLC fractions containing the MRP
The HPLC chromatogram revealed six major peaks eluting
from the column between 13 and 18 minutes (Figure 1).
The fraction most consistently inducing significant male
circling eluted slightly before 17 minutes. This fraction
produced a 3.2Ã higher frequency of male circling than
the EDTA negative control (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.002),
and 54% of the circling observed in the live female positive control.
SDS-PAGE of HPLC fractions
The HPLC fractions differed markedly in protein composition (Figure 2). The 14 minute fraction contained three
dominant bands with apparent molecular masses of 34,
29, and 26 kD. The 34 kD band also was visible in the 15
to 19 minute fractions, but absent from fractions 20 and
21. Likewise, the 29 kD band was clearly visible in fractions 14 to 19, but absent from fractions 20 and 21. The
26 kD band was clearly visible only in fractions 14 and 15.
In all fractions there were a few to several additional
faintly visible protein bands. Only the 16 to 18 minute
fractions possessed significant ability to elicit male mating
behavior, and its most prominent band was 29 kD. N-terminal sequencing was performed on Western blots of two

Identification and characterization of candidate MRP
genes
The B. manjavacas cDNA library had two contigs with
translated open reading frames containing close matches
to the N-terminal sequence of the 29 kD band (Figure 3).
The two contigs can be aligned with only minor gaps but
differ by more than 50% of aligned nucleotides. As both
contigs contained repeats of a conserved motif we designated the two sequences MRP Motif Repeat (MMR) types
A and B. The first contig, designated MMR-A, appeared to
be an incomplete transcript lacking the 5'-end: though
sequenced in both directions from four clones none of the
clones contained a sequence consistent with a 5'-end
untranslated region (UTR) or with the 5'-end signal peptide region discussed below. The assembly of the reads,
and thus the true length of the partial transcript, was

Properties of MMR-B3
Properties of MMR-B3. The gene transcript (bottom) is composed of an 11 base 5'-end untranslated region (UTR), an 849
base coding region (rectangle), and a 34 base 3'-end UTR. The coding region begins with a 16 codon region encoding a signal
peptide (light gray box) followed by 10 additional codons (hashed box) before the first of three repeats of a conserved motif
(dark gray boxes). Arginines within each repeat are indicated with diamonds. The first two motifs are 87 codons each and differ
at a single synonymous position; the third motif is truncated after codon 83 by a stop codon (TAA) and differs from the second
by a single synonymous position. The 3'-end UTR bears no resemblance to the remainder of the motif. The first 41 amino acids
of the predicted peptide (top) show the probability of each residue being part of a signal sequence (line) and the probability of
each residue being on the carboxy side of the signal peptide cleavage site (histogram). The sequence logo to the right shows

primer matching the beginning of the first repeat, which also matches the N-terminal sequence of the 29 kD band. The right
arrow represents the reverse primer. The predicted masses of the full-length peptide, the peptide without the signal region,
and the peptide beginning with the first base of the first repeat (dark boxes only) are 30.9 kD, 29.2 kD, and 28.1 kD, respectively; the isoelectric points are 4.26, 4.16, and 4.02; and the charges at pH 8.0 are -9.4, -10.1, and -11.1.

ambiguous due to the near identity of the motif sequence
across repeats. Sequencing a fosmid clone obtained from
probing the B. manjavacas genomic library with MMR-A
revealed two MMR-A genes with four and seven repeats,
which we designated MMR-A4 and MMR-A7, respectively,
and provided their full coding sequence. Other than differing in the number of repeats of the motif, the coding
regions of MMR-A4 and MMR-A7 are nearly identical, differing at only 2% of aligned nucleotides. Using primers
designed to the 5'-end of the coding sequence and to the
junction of the 3'-end of the coding sequence and the 3'end UTR, we amplified MMR-A4 from both cDNA and
genomic DNA. There was no evidence of additional copies of MMR-A. Comparing the genomic and cDNA
sequences of the two genes showed no evidence of introns
or splicing for either gene.
The contig from the cDNA library representing sequence
type MMR-B was made up of a single clone sequenced in
both directions. As both reads spanned the entire insert,
which contained an open reading frame flanked by 5'and 3'-ends UTRs, the reads could be assembled unambiguously despite the presence of three repeats. We designed
primers to the 5'- and 3'-ends of this transcript, MMR-B3,

and used them to amplify cDNA and genomic DNA. The
only two amplification products were MMR-B3 and a
closely similar MMR-B gene with five repeats of the motif,
MMR-B5. Comparing the genomic and cDNA sequences
of the two genes showed no evidence of introns or splicing for either gene.
The conceptual translations of the MMR genes all share
several features: each begins with a signal peptide region
followed by nearly perfect repeats of a motif of 92 amino
acids (MMR-A) or 87 amino acids (MMR-B); the terminator interrupts the final motif after amino acid 85 (MMRA) or 81 (MMR-B) and there are no amino acids between
repeats of the motif (Figure 3). The motif is 55% to 60%
non-polar with a net negative charge, and is predicted to
be composed of a series of alpha helices, producing a generally globular protein. The region corresponding to the
N-terminal sequence obtained from the 29 kD band
begins at the third amino acid of the first motif (MMR-A)
or at the first amino acid of the first motif (MMR-B). The
MMR-A genes lack codons for asparagine, and thus MMRA protein products are unlikely to be N-glycosylated. Each
motif in the product of the MMR-B genes contains three
asparagines as potential sites for N-glycosylation,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/60

although they do not occur in the series N-X-T, which generally marks N-glycosylated asparagines. Two of the three
asparagines are predicted to be on the hydrophilic sides of
alpha helices, and therefore potentially exposed. None of
the processed MMR peptides has significant similarity to
any sequence in GenBank/EMBL/DDJ databases as judged
by BLASTX and BLASTN searches, or to known protein motifs
as judged by HMMPFAM searches of PFAM databases. After
cleavage of the signal peptide the molecular weights of the
peptides produced by MMR-A4, -A7, -B3, and -B5 are predicted to be 38.4 kD, 69.2 kD, 29.2 kD, and 48.2 kD
respectively; each peptide is predicted to be negatively
charged at pH 8.
MRP RNAi knockdown
Transfection of females with dsRNA for MMR-A7 did not
result in less circling than in the PBS control (Figure 4). In
contrast, transfection with MMR-B3 reduced male circling
by 17%, which is significantly less than the PBS control
(one-way ANOVA, F = 5.74, degrees of freedom = 9, P =
0.043). Neither the combined transfection with MMR-A7
and MMR-B3 dsRNA, nor the GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (MAN) dsRNA had significant effects on rotifer
mating.

Discussion
Characteristics of MRP protein
This study is the culmination of extensive efforts to identify the MRP gene, beginning with studies of the role of
glycoproteins as mating signals in rotifers. Nearly two decades ago the biochemical properties of surface glycoproteins involved in rotifer mate recognition were probed in
binding studies with several fluorescently labeled lectins,
which bind the carbohydrate moiety of the MRP protein
[12,33]. When these lectins were bound, females elicited
significantly fewer mating responses from males. Cleavage
of surface proteins by proteinase K also rendered females
significantly less attractive to males [34], as did cleavage of
N-linked oligosaccharides by the glycohydrolase N-glycanase [11]. Treatment of B. manjavacas females with the
detergent CHAPS and EDTA removed surface proteins and
eliminated the male mating response [12,17]. In the
present study, binding of EDTA-extractable proteins to an
anion exchange column suggests that the proteins possess
a net negative charge at pH 8.0. Adsorption of the surface
glycoproteins to a C3 reversed-phase HPLC column, eluting in 64% to 72% acetonitrile, further suggested the proteins contain hydrophobic domains.

While a putative MRP protein had been previously isolated, our study is the first to report its gene sequence and

confirm its function. Snell et al. [11] described a 29 kD
rotifer surface glycoprotein that likely represented the
MRP. Yet, the amino acid sequence could not be determined from the small quantity of protein that had been
purified, and there is no conclusive way to determine
whether the glycoprotein described is identical to the MRP
protein reported here. Nonetheless, in the current study,
the HPLC fractions of EDTA-extractable proteins capable
of eliciting male mating behavior had only two prominent proteins with 34 and 29 kD apparent mass. Given
the earlier identification of the putative 29 kD MRP, here
we focused on the 29 kD protein as the most likely candidate for the MRP. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of
the 29 kD protein yielded enough sequence to perform a
meaningful search of a rotifer cDNA library. Reduction of
mating from RNAi knockdown of expression of the MMRB3 gene as reported here validates the 29 kD protein as the
MRP, and that this protein is critical for B. manjavacas
mate recognition.
Characteristics of the MRP gene
Using the N-terminal sequence of the 29 kD protein, we
identified two contigs from a cDNA library of B. manjavacas as candidates for the MRP gene. PCR of genomic DNA
and cDNA, as well as sequencing a fosmid from a genomic
library of B. manjavacas containing two candidate genes,
revealed that the N-terminal sequence is a marker for a
family of related genes. This gene family has no recognizable homology to sequences in public databases or to the
protein patterns of PFAM but is characterized by a peptide
signal sequence region followed by repeats of a motif that
contains the N-terminal sequence at or near its 5'-end.
There is a short spacer region between the signal peptide
and the repeats but the repeats follow each other head-totail without interruption. The final motif is invariably
truncated by four to seven codons. The presence of a signal peptide implies that the peptides are secreted via the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with being part of
the extracellular matrix on the surface of the rotifer, and
the negative charge and general hydrophobicity is consistent with previous biochemical studies of the MRP protein.
The MMR-A and MMR-B genes differ at about 50% of
aligned nucleotides (exact homology of the repeats cannot be reliably assigned), but the repeats of a motif within
a gene are identical or differ by only a few nucleotides.

Data suggest MMR-B3 encodes a functional MRP protein.
Despite considerable effort we have not identified a MMRA type gene that would produce a 29 kD peptide. Also,
although the MMR-A motif contains a single potential Oglycosylation site, it does not contain arginine, so is
unlikely to be N-glycosylated. Finally, RNAi with the
MMR-A motif did not decrease male mating behavior. In
contrast, one of the MMR-B type genes, MMR-B3, is predicted to produce a 29 kD product, the MMR-B motif does

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/60

contain arginines, which are predicted to be on the
exposed surface of the protein. Finally, RNAi with the
MMR-B3 gene significantly reduces mating behavior.
Thus, we conclude that MMR-B3 encodes the 29 kD peptide originally identified as the MRP. We hypothesize that
after cleavage of the signal region upon entry into the ER
the peptide is further modified by the removal of the
remaining residues before the first motif, consistent with
N-terminal sequencing of the 29 kD band. Also, one or
more arginines per motif may be N-glycosylated or
another form of oligosaccharide moiety that mimics Nglycosylation in biochemical assays may be added.
That the MRP gene (MMR-B3) has no significant similarity to any deposited sequence may not be surprising, as at
least 20% of the brachionid transcriptome appears to lack
obvious homologs in sequence databases [24], and there
is in general very little knowledge of the genes encoding
extracellular proteins in non-ecdysozoan protostome
phyla. The very low divergence between repeat units, even
at synonymous positions, strongly suggests that the units
are kept nearly identical through a process of concerted
evolution analogous to the preservation of sequence
homogeneity in rRNA clusters. Concerted evolution of
repeats in turn suggests a mechanism by which a single
non-synonymous mutation could rapidly spread to be
present in multiple repeats, effecting a major change in
the structure of the protein. Such saltational change of a
protein involved in mate choice could lead to rapid speciation.
Comparison of the MRP to contact mate recognition
pheromones of other animals
The critical role of a single gene in mate recognition of
rotifers makes their signaling pathway for mate recognition particularly useful for studying the molecular mechanisms and evolution of mate recognition, and the role of
mating genes in speciation. In contrast, in many other animals a variety of factors are influential, and thus assigning
functional roles of genes is difficult. In B. manjavacas, glycoproteins from the female are necessary and sufficient to
elicit male circling [17]. Chemosensory mate recognition
genes also have been described in other animal species
[3]. Perhaps most similar to rotifers is the mate recognition system of the fruit fly Drosophila. Males evaluate the
approximately 20 cuticular hydrocarbons (CH) of females
by contact chemoreception to discriminate mates and prefer to mate with same-strain females [35]. Olfactory receptors on the antennae and gustatory receptors on the tarsa
and proboscis of males detect immobilized surface heptacosadienes on females of 20 to 40 carbons in chain length
[36]. The neurobiological basis of mating decisions in
Drosophila also is beginning to be revealed [37]. It is now
understood that the quantity and blends of various CHs
contain information about species and geographic popu-

BMC Biology 2009, 7:60

lation and males use this information to determine
whether or not to mate. Owing to the large number of
CHs involved in mate recognition, the genetic basis of
mating phenotypes is complex [38] and only a few genes
have been characterized [36]. In addition, temperature,
food, and social experience can influence CH profiles.
This has made it difficult to relate CHs directly to evolutionary processes like sexual selection and to determine
explicitly their role in speciation. In contrast, in B. manjavacas the MRP is a glycoprotein immobilized on the surfaces of females [11]. It is encoded by a single gene and the
MRP phenotype apparently is subject to little environmental modification. The MRP therefore should be an
excellent molecular marker for investigating selection and
speciation processes in monogonont rotifers.
In comparison with other invertebrates, specifically
insects, the composition of the MRP protein provides an
indication of how differing selection pressures imposed
by terrestrial versus aquatic habitats may have influenced
evolution of mating systems. The use of CHs as recognition pheromones by insects is a general theme not limited
to Drosophila [39-41]. This channel of communication is
not surprising since CHs are the most prominent molecules on external surfaces of insects [42]. CHs play a central role in minimizing desiccation [43], and thus their
evolution may have resulted from strong selection for desiccation resistance that accompanied the colonization of
land. The ability to decipher the information encoded in
the molecular composition of cuticles is clearly a useful
trait and eventually became the basis of mate recognition
in many insects. Aquatic animals have very different cuticles since most have not experienced strong selection for
desiccation resistance. For example, Alarie et al. [44]
found substantial differences between CH profiles of an
aquatic beetle compared with its terrestrial counterpart.
We suggest that information-rich molecules like surface
glycoproteins are well adapted for chemical communication and that aquatic animals may have evolved signaling
systems based on these compounds. In this sense, the surfaces of aquatic animals are more like those of individual
mammalian cells, which typically are highly decorated
with information-rich glycoproteins (see, for example,
Gahmberg and Tolvanen [45]). Glycoproteins and their
oligosaccharide moieties have been implicated in a wide
variety of cell-cell and cell-matrix recognition events
[45,46]. By providing evidence of a surface glycoprotein in
brachionid rotifers involved in mate recognition of conspecifics, we provide one example of how such compounds are involved in chemical communication in
aquatic environments.
Like rotifers, some copepods also use surface glycoproteins to make mating decisions [47]. Mate-guarding in the
harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus japonicus can be inhibited

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/60

by binding lectins to surface glycoproteins of females
[48,49]. Before males initiate guarding behavior or transfer spermatophores, stroking behavior is engaged in
which the male probes the female body surface, presumably in search of chemical cues. The carbohydrate moiety of
glycoproteins on the female are thought to be detected by
protein receptors on antennules of the male, enabling
identification of appropriate partners for mating. Purification of female surface proteins revealed a 70 kD glycoprotein, with significant similarity to the sequence of Î±2macroglobulin [49,50].

Conclusion
Here we have isolated the rotifer MRP, identified MMR-B3
as the MRP gene, and demonstrated its essential role in
male mate recognition by functional assays with RNAi.
Our study provides an initial synthesis of behavioral, biochemical, and molecular assays to characterize the mating
system of brachionid rotifers. This system may be an
important model for comparative studies of mating signaling pathways in aquatic and terrestrial animals. The
phylogenetic variation in the MRP gene can now be studied in conjunction with the large amount of ecological
and population genetic data being gathered for the Brachionus plicatilis species complex to understand better the
evolutionary drivers of cryptic speciation. Characterization of the MRP protein will facilitate identification and
isolation of the second key element in the rotifer mate recognition signaling system, the male MRP receptor. Males
have a variety of receptors in their coronas, and we are
investigating a gene in a family of C-type lectins with putative roles in cell adhesion and pathogen recognition [51]
as a potential target.
