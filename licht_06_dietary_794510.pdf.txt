Abstract
Background: A study was designed to elucidate effects of selected carbohydrates on composition
and activity of the intestinal microbiota. Five groups of eight rats were fed a western type diet
containing cornstarch (reference group), sucrose, potato starch, inulin (a long- chained fructan) or
oligofructose (a short-chained fructan). Fructans are, opposite sucrose and starches, not digestible
by mammalian gut enzymes, but are known to be fermentable by specific bacteria in the large
intestine.
Results: Animals fed with diets containing potato starch, or either of the fructans had a significantly
(p < 0.05) higher caecal weight and lower caecal pH when compared to the reference group,
indicating increased fermentation. Selective cultivation from faeces revealed a higher amount of
lactic acid bacteria cultivable on Rogosa agar in these animals. Additionally, the fructan groups had
a lower amount of coliform bacteria in faeces. In the inulin and oligofructose groups, higher levels
of butyrate and propionate, respectively, were measured.
Principal Component Analysis of profiles of the faecal microbiota obtained by Denaturing Gradient
Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes as well as of Reverse
Transcriptase-PCR amplified bacterial 16S rRNA resulted in different phylogenetic profiles for each
of the five animal groups as revealed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of band patterns.
Conclusion: Even though sucrose and cornstarch are both easily digestible and are not expected
to reach the large intestine, the DGGE band patterns obtained indicated that these carbohydrates
indeed affected the composition of bacteria in the large gut. Also the two fructans resulted in
completely different molecular fingerprints of the faecal microbiota, indicating that even though
they are chemically similar, different intestinal bacteria ferment them. Comparison of DNA-based
and RNA-based profiles suggested that two species within the phylum Bacteroidetes were not
abundant in numbers but had a particularly high ribosome content in the animals fed with inulin.

Background
Prebiotics are dietary carbohydrates, which escape digestion in the small intestine, but undergo bacterial fermen-

tation in the large intestine, and beneficially affect the
intestinal microbiota [1]. In addition to a well-established
effect on bowel habit and stool bulking, animal studies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/98

suggest that ingestion of non-digestible carbohydrates has
a protective effect against colon carcinogenesis [2-4].
Inulin-type prebiotics are fermentable fructans that stimulate growth of bifidobacteria, which are regarded as benefical organisms populating the large bowel [5]. Prebiotic
products include the long-chained inulin and the shortchained oligofructose, in both of which the monomers are
linked by β(2-1) bonds that are not digested in the upper
intestinal tract.
Since the cultivable part of the faecal microbiota probably
constitutes only 20–50% of the gut microbes [6], it is
important to explore effects on this complex ecosystem by
use of molecular fingerprinting methods allowing representation of the non-cultivable bacterial species. An example of such a fingerprinting method is Denaturing
Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified
16S rRNA genes, which have proved very useful for analysis of faecal bacteria [7-9]. While the DGGE profiles based
on amplified rRNA genes (DNA-DGGE) provides a fingerprint of the composition of the investigated community,
they do not necessarily reflect metabolic activities, and
could even originate from dormant, lysed or dead cells.
The number of ribosomes in prokaryotic cells is correlated
to growth rate [10,11], and profiles based on amplified
ribosomal RNA sequences (RNA-DGGE) may better
reflect the metabolically active bacterial community.
Indeed, a recent study showed that alterations of bacterial
community profiles after ingestion of prebiotic oligosaccharides by human subjects were only detected in DGGE
profiles generated from bacterial rRNA [12].

The objective of the present study was to elucidate the
effects of dietary carbohydrates with different digestibility
including sucrose, potato starch, inulin, oligofructose and
a cornstarch-based control on the composition and activity of the rat intestinal microbiota as measured by physiological parameters, short-chain fatty acid composition,
selective cultivation, DNA-DGGE and RNA-DGGE.

Results
Weight gain and feed consumption
During the five weeks of feeding, the rats fed the oligofructose containing diet (Table 1) consumed only 79% of the
amount of feed consumed by rats in the control group (p
< 0.05). Consistently, also the weight gain of these rats
was significantly (p < 0.05) lower (80%) than recorded for
the control rats. (Data not shown).
Effects on caecal weight, pH and SCFA content
Caecal weight (with and without contents) and pH of the
caecal contents of animals fed either potato starch, inulin
or oligofructose were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than
in animals fed the control diet (Table 2). Capillary zone
electrophoresis revealed a content of acetic acid ranging
between 25 and 35 mM in caecum of all animals, while
the corresponding concentrations of propionic and
butyric acid was generally lower. The concentration of
butyric acid and propionic acid in the caecum content of
animals fed with either of the fructans was higher than in
the other groups. The increase in propionic acid concentration reached statistical significance in animals fed with
inulin, whereas the concentration of butyric acid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in animals given oligofructose
(Figure 1).

Effects on selected cultivable bacterial groups in faeces
Faecal contents of cultivable aerobic bacteria ranged
between 107 and 108 per gram, and of cultivable anaerobic
bacteria between 109 and 1010 per gram. Numbers of coliform bacteria were significantly lower, and numbers of
lactic acid bacteria growing on Rogosa agar were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the faeces from animals fed
with either of the fructans than observed in the control
group (Figure 2). Additionally, numbers of Enterococcus
spp. were lower in animals on the inulin diet than in the
control animals.
Effects on DGGE fingerprints of faecal microbiota
The average number of bands obtained on DNA-based
DGGE profiles was 16.5 ± 6, while the corresponding
number for RNA-based profiles was 17.4 ± 6. The numbers of bands obtained did not differ significantly
between the five dietary groups. Principal Component
Analysis of obtained DNA-based as well as RNA-based
DGGE profiles revealed that samples from animals
belonging to the same dietary group clustered together,
but that all dietary groups produced different profiles with
the only exception of the RNA-based profiles of the con-

trol and sucrose groups, which overlapped (Figure 3 and
4).
By comparison by eye of DNA and RNA based profiles
obtained from the same faecal samples, two specific
bands were observed, which were prominent in the RNA
based profiles but absent or vague in the DNA profiles
from all animals fed with inulin (Figure 5). A similar evident difference between DNA- and RNA profiles was not
observed in samples from any of the other dietary groups
(data not shown). Cloning and sequencing of the excised
bands resulted in sequence fragments of 173–185 bps,
which matched 100% to sequences within the genera of
Bacteroides and Rikenella, respectively, both of which
belongs to the order of Bacteroidales (Figure 5).

Discussion
In order to simulate the food consumption of western
consumers, a western-type diet was given to rats in the
present study. It is generally recognized that consumption
of fructans such as inulin and oligofructose specifically
stimulates bifidobacteria, probably due to production of
β-fructosidase by these organisms, which makes them

able to ferment these substances [13,14]. In the present
study, a significant in vivo stimulation of species growing
on Rogosa agar was observed (Figure 2). This medium is
designed to selectively promote growth of lactobacilli, but
may give rise to many false positive colonies from faecal
samples [15]. Although evidence exists that at least some
species of Lactobacillus are able to utilize fructans in vitro
[16], and can be stimulated by these in vivo [17], some of
the observed increase in colony counts on Rogosa may
therefore be attributed to an increase in bifidobacteria
[15].
We speculate, that the stimulation of bifidobacteria/lactobacilli may occur also through other mechanisms than
specific fermentation of the ingested carbohydrate, e.g.
the effect on pH may favour growth of lactic acid bacteria
over other gut microorganisms competing for intestinal
nutrients.
We recorded increased levels of butyrate and propionate
in caecal contents of animals fed with inulin and oligofructose, respectively. Increased butyrate formation is generally considered to be a desirable effect, since butyrate
induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines, and is also the preferred fuel for enterocytes [18,19]. It should however be
borne in mind that neither lactobacilli nor bifidobacteria
produce butyrate, thus the observed increase must result
from stimulation of bacterial species other than these.

Our findings of increased caecum weights and decreased
caecal pH in animals fed with indigestible fructans (Table
2), indicate increased fermentation in caecum, and are
consistent with previously reported studies [20]. Also animals fed with potato starch exhibited increased caecal
weight and decreased pH (Table 2) in consistence with a
previous study [21]. This indicates that potato starch may
have fermentation-stimulating effects on the gut environment.
Analysis of rRNA genes as well as of extracted ribosomal
RNA in faeces from animals fed with sucrose, potato
starch, inulin, oligofructose and control diets by DGGE
resulted in different profiles from animals belonging to
each of the five dietary groups, with the only exception of
the rRNA-based profiles of the control and sucrose
groups, which overlapped (Figure 3 and 4). The average
number of bands obtained by DGGE was approximately
17 in all of the dietary groups, indicating that the overall
complexity of the microbiota was unaltered by the
ingested carbohydrates. Notably, the sucrose-based diet
and the cornstarch-based control diet produced different
phylogenetic bacterial fingerprints (Figure 3). This indicates, that although cornstarch is not resistant to digestion
in the small intestine, a part of it may escape digestion and
reach the bacterial community in the large bowel [22].
Cornstarch consists uniquely of glucose subunits, while
the subunits of sucrose is glucose and fructose, and it can

substantiates the indication that different bacterial populations are fermenting these two fructans. Consistently,
previous studies revealed different effects of short- and
long-chained fructans on large intestine physiology and
formation of Aberrant Crypt Foci in rats [21,23]. We speculate that the long-chained fructans travels further into
the large bowel before they are degraded than the shortchained fructans, and that this may partly explain that different groups of bacteria are affected. Additionally, when
degrading inulin, microorganisms equipped with endofructanases will have an advantage compared to organisms producing only exo-fructosidases, while this is less
true for oligofructose degradation.
It has been reported that the impact of consumption of
oligosaccharides on human faecal microbiota could be
detected only by comparison of RNA-DGGE profiles,
while no effect on DNA-DGGE profiles was seen [12].
However, a much larger diversity in faecal microbiota
from human subjects than in genetically homogeneous
experimental animals fed a completely controlled diet is
to be expected, and this larger diversity may have masked
an eventual effect on the human DNA-DGGE profiles.

be speculated that the presence of fructose stimulates gut
bacteria other than those stimulated by glucose.
Additionally, it is notable that the phylogenetic composition of faecal bacteria (DNA-based DGGE profiles) as well
as the fingerprints of metabolically active organisms in
faeces (rRNA-based DGGE profiles) differed markedly
between animals fed with the long-chained inulin and the
short-chained oligofructose (Figure 4), indicating that the
bacterial subspecies specifically stimulated by these two
carbohydrate sources are different, although no major differences was observed between these two groups by selective cultivation (Figure 2). Furthermore, inulin caused a
significant increase in the level of butyric acid in caecum,
while oligofructose caused an increase in the level of propionic acid as compared to the control (Figure 1), which

Comparison of DNA-based and rRNA-based profiles from
the animals fed with inulin revealed that two bacterial
species both belonging to the order of Bacteriodales were
not sufficiently abundant to be visible on the phylogenetic fingerprint, but had a very high rRNA content, suggesting a highly active protein synthesis, i.e. rapid growth
and metabolism (Figure 5). While there has been extensive focus on the specific bifidogenic effect of inulin
[13,14], only few reports exist describing effects on other
species although it is known that also other intestinal bacteria including species of Bacteroides are able to ferment
fructo-oligosachharides [24]. Due to its contribution to
putrefaction in the intestinal environment, Bacteroides is
not normally counted among the bacteria which it is
desirable to stimulate, although it also contributes to the
synthesis of vitamins [14], and has recently been reported
to modulate maturation of the host immune system [25].
Therefore, a decrease in the Bacteroides population after
intake of fructo-oligosaccharides, which has been seen in
human microbiota-associated rats [26] and in human volunteers [27], is considered a beneficial effect. Such a
decrease is not contradicted by our observations, since the
identified species of the phylum Bacteroidetes are not visible on the DNA-DGGE profile (Figure 5), but our current
findings suggest that these although they are small, these
populations may be very actively growing in the inulinfed rats. Still, rapid growth would be expected to result in
an increase in the population size, and it should be taken
into consideration that ribosomes are quite stable, and
that the ribosomal concentration in bacterial cells is not
down-regulated immediately when growth stops. The

Page 6 of 10

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:98

explanation for the prominent bands on the RNA-DGGE
profiles may therefore be that the high ribosome content
in the Bacteriodetes species resulted from stimulation of
growth of a small subpopulation e.g. associated with a
given intestinal compartment. Shedding of bacteria with a
high ribosome concentration would occur continuously
from such a subpopulation and the stable ribosomes
would remain in the bacterial cells excreted with faeces.
This has been suggested to be the explanation for the high
ribosome content of intestinal Esherichia coli, which, similarly, is not correlated to rapid growth of the entire intestinal E. coli population [28,29]. Another explanation for
the prominent differences between the bands representing the Bacteroides and Rikenella sp. on the DNA-DGGE
and RNA-DGGE gels may be bias of the preceding nucleic
acid extraction procedures and/or PCR amplifications.
However, since such a difference was observed only in the
animals fed inulin, and only for these particular bands, we
find it unlikely that it should be the result of PCR bias.

Conclusion
We conclude that moderate changes in the carbohydrate
composition of the feed affected the phylogenetic composition of the intestinal microbiota. In specific cases, also
the ribosome content of given species was changed.
This underlines the need for studies, which include phylogenetic analysis of the intestinal microbial communities
present as well as assessment of their activities in order to
fully explore the effect of prebiotics on the intestinal
microbiota.

Methods
Animals and housing
Forty 8–10 weeks old male Fisher 344 rats were obtained
from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The animals
were housed two by two in standard cages. During the
study the temperature was maintained at 22 ± 1°C and
relative humidity at 55 ± 5%, air was changed 8–10 times
per hour, and fluorescent light was on from 9.00 to 21.00.
Diets and acidified water (adjusted to pH 3.05 by citric
acid to prevent growth of microorganisms) were provided
ad libitum.

Animal experiments were carried out under the supervision of the Danish National Agency for Protection of
Experimental Animals.
Diets and experimental design
The animals were randomized to five different dietary
groups with 8 animals per group (Table 1). Dietscontained the same amounts of macro- and micronutrients.
Caloric values were balanced, only diets containing inulin
and oligofructose had7% less calories than the control

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/98

diet due to the lower caloric value of these fructans compared to cornstarch.
For one week before these diets were introduced, the animals were all fed with the reference diet. Animals were fed
their respective diets for five weeks. Body weight and food
consumption were recorded weekly. After euthanization,
caecal weight and caecal pH were recorded for each animal, and the composition of short-chain fatty acids
(SCFA) in faeces was estimated as described below. Faecal
samples excreted during the last 24 hours of the experiment were collected from the cages of the rats, each sample thus representing the two animals, which were caged
together.
Inulin (Raftiline®) and oligofructose (Raftilose®) was purchased from Alsiano (Birkerod, Denmark). Other feed
components were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Brondby, Denmark), Bie & Berntsen (Rodovre, Denmark), SFK Food (Viborg, Denmark), Unikem (Copenhagen, Denmark), and the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural
University (Copenhagen, Denmark).
Analysis of SCFA composition and pH in caecal samples
Acetic, propionic, and butyric acid in caecal contents were
analysed using capillary electrophoresis and indirect UV
detection by a method modified from Westergaard et al.
[30]. Briefly, ca. 0.1 g of caecum contents were suspended
in 9 of alkaline buffer (0.1 M tris, pH 8.7 with 100 μM
malonic acid as internal standard), centrifuged (14000 g,
10 min, 4°C) and filtrated using a sterile 0.2 μm filter
(Minisart). Samples were kept at -80°C until analysis.
Prior to analysis the samples were diluted 60 times by running buffer (0.2 mM 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid), 8
mM TRIS, 0.3 mM tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide and 0.15 mM heptakis ((2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-βcyclodextrin), pH 7.6). The fused silica capillary (0.75 μm,
80.5 cm and 72 cm to detector window) purchased from
Agilent, Germany, was rinsed with 1 M NaOH before each
sequence and pre-treated with water for 0.5 min, 0.1 M
NaOH for 1 min and runningbuffer for 5 min before each
run. Samples were injected by pressure (35 mbar, 2 sec)
and run at -30 kV for 12 min on a G1600A 3DCapillary
electrophoresis Instrument (Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany). All chemicals were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich, Germany.
Selective cultivation of bacteria from faecal samples
Anaerobic and aerobic cultivable bacteria in fresh faecal
samples were enumerated on Reinforced clostridial agar
(Oxoid, Hampshire, England), Lactobacillus spp. (and others) on Rogosa (Oxoid), coliforms on MacConkey agar
no. 3 (Oxoid) and Enterococcus spp. on Slanetz and Bartley
agar (Oxoid). Samples were homogenized and appropriate dilutions were plated on the selective agars.

for 3 days, whereas coliforms, enterococci and total aerobes were incubated aerobically for 1, 2, or 3 days, respectively. All incubations were carried out at 37°C.
Extraction of bacterial DNA and rRNA from faecal
samples
For DNA extraction, frozen faecal samples were diluted
1:10 (w/vol) in phosphate-buffered saline and thawed at
4°C. DNA was extracted from 2 ml of the 10-1 dilution by
a method previously described [31], purified using the
QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
and stored in 30 μl autoclaved water at -21°C until use.

For RNA extraction, frozen faecal samples were diluted
1:10 (w/vol) in a 1:1 mixture of RNAse-free water and
RNALater (Ambion), thawed at 4°C, homogenized and
centrifuged at 200 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was
transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 14.000 g for
5 minutes, and the pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of a
1:1 mixture of RNAse-free water and RNALater. The suspension was transferred to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube containing approximately 500 mg of zirconia-silica beads
(Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA). A 30 μl
quantity of 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate was added, and
the bacteria were lysed by shaking for 4 minutes on a bead
beater (Mixer Mill MM 300, Retch, Haan, Germany) at 30
Hz. After centrifugation at 1000 g for 20s, the supernatant
was transferred to a new tube and kept at -20°C until RNA
isolation by use of Qiagen RNeasy columns (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturers instructions. Residual
DNA was removed by treatment with DNA-free™
(Ambion). RNA integrity was assessed by electrophoresis
of each sample in a 1.2 agarose gel in which 16S and 23S
RNA bands were observed.
PCR and RT-PCR amplification
Aliquots (10 μl) of purified DNA were applied to the following to give a 50 μl PCR reaction mixture: 20 μl of
Eppendorf® Mastermix (2.5×) (Eppendorf) and 40 pmol
of each of the universal primers HDA1-GC/HDA2 [32]
targeting all bacteria. PCR was run in a Peltier Thermal
Cycler PTC-225 (MJ Research) as a touchdown PCR. Initial denaturation was at 96° for 5 min, amplification was
carried out using 20 cycles including denaturation at
94°C for 1 min, annealing at 65°C for 1 min decreased by
0.5°C for each cycle, and extension at 72°C for 1 min.
This was followed by additional 5 cycles of denaturation
at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min, extension
at 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C at 5 min.

Aliquots (10 μl) of purified ribosomal RNA were amplified using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturers instructions, using the
same primers as for DNA amplification. 1% (vol/vol) of

Rnase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems) was used in the RTPCR reactions. Reverse transcription PCR was run in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-225 (MJ Research) with the following amplification program: one cycle consisting of 30
minutes at 50°C (reverse transcription) and 15 minutes at
95°C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for
30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for
45 s. This was followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10
min. PCR amplification and subsequent DGGE separation was performed twice for each sample.
Analysis of faecal microbiota by DGGE
DGGE was carried out as previously described [9] using a
DCode™ Universal Mutation Detection System instrument and gradient former model 475 according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Labs, Hercules, California). The denaturing gradient was formed with two
9% acrylamide (acrylamide-bis 37.5:1) stock solutions
(Bio-Rad) in 1 × TAE (20 mM Tris, 10 mM acetate, 0.5 M
EDTA, pH 7.4). The gels were made with denaturing gradients ranging from 25 to 65%. The 100% denaturant
solution contained 40% formamide and 7 M urea.13 μl
PCR product were mixed with 3 μl loading dye before
loading. Gels were run in 1 × TAE at 60°C for 16 hr at 36
V, 28 mA, stained with the fluorescent dye Gelstar (Biowhittaker) for 45 min, and viewed by UV trans illumination. The BioNumerics software, version 3.00 (Applied
Maths, Belgium) was used for identification of bands and
normalization of band patterns from DGGE gels. Principal Component Analysis of DGGE pattern profiles was
performed using the same software. Subtraction of averages over the characters was included in the PCA analysis.
Quantitative values (band intensities) were not used.
Excision, cloning and sequencing of selected bands from
DGGE gels
Bands of specific interest were excised from DGGE gels
with a sterile razor, placed in 40 μl sterile water, and incubated at 4°C for diffusion of DNA into the water. 33 μl of
the sterile water (containing the DNA) was treated with S1
nuclease [12]. The S1 nuclease treated DNA was used in a
PCR with HDA1/2 primers without GC-clamp (4 min at
94°C, 20 cycles consisting of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at
56°C, and 1 min at 68°C, and finally 7 min at 68°C).
Subsequently the PCR products were directly cloned into
pCR® 4-TOPO (Invitrogen, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and electroporated into electrocompetent E. coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen, UK) with a single
pulse (2500 V, 400 Ω, 25 μF) by use of a Gene Pulser
apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Plasmid DNA was isolated from the cells using the Qiagen
Mini Spin Prep kit (QIAGEN, Germany), and subjected to
PCR (HDA1/2-GC) as earlier described. The PCR product
was run on a DGGE gel to check the purity and confirm
the melting behavior of the excised band. The inserts were

sequenced by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany) using primers
T3 and T7. The obtained sequences were compared to
known sequences in the Ribosomal Database (RDP,
Michigan State University, Release 9.32).

Statistics
All parameters were tested for normal distribution with
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test used on the residuals. The
homogeneity of variance among groups was tested using
Levenes test. Log-transformations were performed for
data, which did not meet these criteria. Dunnets test was
used to compare dosed groups with control where
ANOVA indicate a significant single factor effect.
