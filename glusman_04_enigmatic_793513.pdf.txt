Abstract
Background: The runt domain transcription factors are key regulators of developmental
processes in bilaterians, involved both in cell proliferation and differentiation, and their disruption
usually leads to disease. Three runt domain genes have been described in each vertebrate genome
(the RUNX gene family), but only one in other chordates. Therefore, the common ancestor of
vertebrates has been thought to have had a single runt domain gene.
Results: Analysis of the genome draft of the fugu pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) reveals the existence
of a fourth runt domain gene, FrRUNT, in addition to the orthologs of human RUNX1, RUNX2 and
RUNX3. The tiny FrRUNT packs six exons and two putative promoters in just 3 kb of genomic
sequence. The first exon is located within an intron of FrSUPT3H, the ortholog of human SUPT3H,
and the first exon of FrSUPT3H resides within the first intron of FrRUNT. The two gene structures
are therefore "interlocked". In the human genome, SUPT3H is instead interlocked with RUNX2.
FrRUNT has no detectable ortholog in the genomes of mammals, birds or amphibians. We consider
alternative explanations for an apparent contradiction between the phylogenetic data and the
comparison of the genomic neighborhoods of human and fugu runt domain genes. We hypothesize
that an ancient RUNT locus was lost in the tetrapod lineage, together with FrFSTL6, a member of a
novel family of follistatin-like genes.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the runt domain family may have started expanding in
chordates much earlier than previously thought, and exemplify the importance of detailed analysis
of whole-genome draft sequence to provide new insights into gene evolution.

Background
Since the initial description of the Drosophila segmentation gene runt over a decade ago [1], a small family of runt
domain (RD) genes has been described and extensively
analyzed in several species. The 130 amino acid long runt
domain is very highly conserved and is readily identifiable
computationally. RD transcription factors are developmental regulators involved both in cell proliferation and

differentiation, and their disruption usually leads to disease [2].
In humans, three different RD genes were identified [3]
and named according to various schemes, currently standardized by the human gene symbols RUNX1, RUNX2 and
RUNX3. RUNX genes have two promoters (P1 and P2,
also called distal and proximal, respectively) [4-7]

separated by a long intron; the proximal promoter (P2) is
always located within a large CpG island [8]. Extensive
alternative splicing giving rise to many isoforms has been
described for all RUNX genes [9-11].
Orthologs of all three human RUNX genes were identified
in mouse. A single RD gene was described in Xenopus, presumed to be orthologous to RUNX1 [12]. An experimental search for RD genes in fugu showed the existence of a
fugu ortholog of human RUNX2, and suggested the existence of a single additional RD gene in fugu [13], while a
computational search of the fugu genomic sequence
revealed three RUNX genes [14]. Four RD genes were
identified in Drosophila [14,15], while a single RD gene
exists in C. elegans [16], sea urchin and amphioxus [17].
Based on these data, current thought on the evolution of
the RD gene family posits that a single RD gene was
present in the common ancestor of chordates [17], and
this ancestral gene triplicated during early vertebrate evolution, giving rise to the modern RUNX gene complement. The proposed mechanism of expansion involved
large-scale genomic duplications, identifiable today as
large paralogous segments [18]. The proper identification
of true orthology relationships is often helpful for inferring gene function and translating knowledge between
model organisms and more complex species. Under the
current model, simple orthology relationships should be
expected among vertebrate RUNX genes, but their functional relationship to the ancestral RD gene is unknown.
The single known RD gene in C. elegans has been shown
to be required for the formation of a functional gut; this
role has been claimed to be conserved with mouse Runx3
[19].
The current availability of genome drafts for several vertebrate species, including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus
norvegicus, Canis familiaris, Gallus gallus, Takifugu rubripes,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, Danio rerio and Xenopus tropicalis,
allows us to explore a comprehensive set of vertebrate RD
genes and characterize their genomic environments, shedding light on the structure and evolution of this important
gene family.

Results
The fugu genome has at least four runt domain genes
Our search for RD genes in the fugu draft yielded four distinct genomic scaffolds (Fig. 1 and Table 1), each containing a single, complete RD gene. Each scaffold had one or
more sequence gaps, some within the RD genes, others
between them and their neighbors. We employed a
directed sequencing approach to obtain the additional
sequence needed to close the gaps in these four scaffolds
and to improve sequence quality.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/43

We studied the four scaffold sequences using the GESTALT
Workbench [20] and constructed hypothetical gene structures for the fugu RD genes by maximizing similarity to
known vertebrate RD proteins. Three of the four RD genes
found in the fugu genome have clear one-to-one similarity relationships with the three mammalian RUNX genes
(see phylogenetic analysis below). They have been
assumed to be their orthologs [14,17]; we call them
FrRUNX1, FrRUNX2 and FrRUNX3 (Fig. 1). Their
genomic structures are similar to those of their human
counterparts, but their sizes have evolved differently.
RUNX3 is the smallest of the three human RUNX genes,
while in fugu FrRUNX3 is the largest (Table 1), and
FrRUNX2 is significantly larger than FrRUNX1. FrRUNX1
has acquired an additional intron [17] that is not present
in human RUNX1 or in any other RD gene. This intron is
just 65 bp long, has canonical splice signals, and is in
phase 0 with respect to the protein reading frame, at the
beginning of the runt domain. An additional intron has
been described at the 5' end of the coding region, yielding
a short form that would be locally non-homologous to
the other RD genes [14]. A detailed comparison of human
RUNX2 and FrRUNX2 has been published [13]. In both
human and in fugu, RUNX3 has the highest G+C content
of the RD genes, while the G+C content of RUNX2 differs
significantly between the two species (Table 1).
The fugu RUNT gene
In addition to the three RUNX genes, the fugu genome has
a fourth and more divergent runt-domain gene, that we
named FrRUNT. FrRUNT is an extremely compact gene,
spanning just 3 kb of genomic sequence (Fig. 2). Based on
sequence analysis only, FrRUNT appears to have two promoters, with an intron separating the hypothetical distal
promoter (P1) and first exon from the main body of the
gene. This intron is usually very long in RUNX genes. It is
indeed the longest intron observed in FrRUNT, but it is
nevertheless very short, spanning just 1372 bp. There is a
local concentration of CpG dinucleotides 200–300 bp
upstream of exon 2 (Figs. 1, 2), suggesting that an incipient CpG island might function as a proximal promoter
(P2). The G+C content is not elevated in this area, in similarity to the CpG islands of the fugu RUNX genes (Fig. 1).
The main body of the gene is split into five exons, separated by much shorter introns (69–190 bp long), all of
which have canonical splice signals. The longest predicted
FrRUNT product is 294 amino acids long, in contrast with
the 496 aa, 463 aa and 421 aa observed for FrRUNX1,
FrRUNX2 and FrRUNX3, respectively. The small number
of exons in FrRUNT leaves little room for alternative splicing by exon skipping, without compromising functionally
important domains of the protein. The overall compactness of the gene makes the incorporation of yet undetected exons improbable. Several cryptic splice sites within

Figure 1
The four fugu scaffolds analyzed and visualized using the GESTALT Workbench. The RD genes are aligned by the position of
the proximal promoter. For each scaffold, graphs are shown of the CpG contrast values (observed/expected, typically ~0.5 for
the fugu genome), G+C percentage (green – below 43%, blue – between 43% and 50%, red – above 50%), interspersed repeats
(SINEs in red, LINEs in green, DNA and LTR elements in brown, other repeats in purple), and gene annotations. Genes and
repeats displayed above each black midline are in the forward strand, while those displayed under the midline are in the
reverse strand of the sequence. All scaffolds are shown at a resolution of 200 bp/pixel, except for scaffold 835, which includes
the tiny FrRUNT gene. For clarity, only the last 17 kb of this scaffold are shown at 20 bp/pixel. The much longer scaffold scaffold
183 is also shown truncated at 182 kb; the LCK locus has been studied in detail elsewhere [42].

the exons could enable splicing variants altering exon
length.
FrRUNT is exceptional in that the length of the runt
domain (131 residues) varies from the universally conserved 130 amino acids, due to the introduction of an
asparagine residue after position 47 in the RD (Fig. 2).
This appears to be the first report of such a mutation

within this highly conserved domain. We also noted that
the RD sequence of the tunicate Oikopleura dioica
(AAS21356 in GenBank) has an insertion at the same
position (of two amino acids, a proline and an isoleucine). Comparison to the published structure of this
domain [21] shows that this variable region is located in
loop L4, opposite the DNA-binding region, i.e. in the
location least likely to disrupt the structure of the protein.

The inverted lettering for SUPT3H denotes translation from the reverse strand. The two putative promoters and the extent of the runt domain (RD) are indicated; x1–x6 denote the six exons. The black triangle points at
the asparagine residue absent from all previously known runt domain proteins.

A surprising observation is that FrRUNT is "interlocked"
with FrSUPT3H (Fig. 2), the gene orthologous to the
human transcription factor SUPT3H [22]: The first exon of
FrRUNT is located within the first intron of FrSUPT3H,
and vice-versa. In the human genome, though, SUPT3H is
interlocked with RUNX2, as shown in [13]. We discuss the

puzzles posed by these differences in genomic organization below.

search into this draft reveals four RD genes with clear
orthologous relationships with the four fugu RD genes.
We call them TnRUNX1, TnRUNX2 and TnRUNX3, and
TnRUNT (Table 2). The RD portion of TnRUNT has been
deposited in the EMBL database (accession CAG00330);
in this work we report the complete gene structure of
TnRUNT, which is similar to that of FrRUNT. In further
similarity with the fugu genomic organization, TnRUNT is
"interlocked" with the Tetraodon ortholog of SUPT3H
(not shown). The three RUNX gene pairs are conserved
between fugu and Tetraodon (Table 2) and display a
larger percentage of protein identity than nucleotide identity, indicating a prevalence of conservative substitutions.
In contrast, TnRUNT is only 83.3% identical to FrRUNT at
the protein level, less than their nucleotide identity.
Indeed, a striking series of non-synonymous mutations
has created a highly divergent segment (only eight identical amino acids out of twenty-two) including the N-terminus of the runt domain (Fig. 3). The strong and
unexpected divergence is not the result of local low
sequence quality, as tested by examining the relevant
Tetraodon entries from the NCBI Trace Archive, and by
resequencing the fugu gene. The differences between
TnRUNT and FrRUNT do not modify the Ig-like β-sandwich core of the runt domain [21], which is highly conserved as expected. Therefore, the structural integrity of
the runt domain appears not to be compromised. We can
only speculate that the extensive variation in its N-terminus may reflect species-specific constraints.

Phylogenetic distribution of runt domain genes
We performed exhaustive computational searches for RD
genes, and in particular for potential orthologs of
FrRUNT, using the available drafts of the human, chimp,
mouse, rat, dog, chicken and frog genomes. In all cases,
we identified three clear matches corresponding to
orthologs of the three RUNX genes. None of these
genomes included a potential ortholog of the fugu/
Tetraodon RUNT gene. In principle, such orthologs might
be found in the future within current sequencing gaps or
heterochromatic regions, but considering the virtually finished human genome, and the combined coverage of all
the genome drafts, we can infer that the RUNT gene is
absent in mammals, and probably in all tetrapods.

We also searched for RD genes in the genome draft of the
zebrafish, Danio rerio [24]. Orthologs of RUNX1-3 are
present, but no ortholog of FrRUNT could be found. This
could be due to the incompleteness of the draft sequence.
On the other hand, there are two copies of RUNX2,
RUNX2A and RUNX2B, which have been shown to have
somewhat different patterns of expression [25]. We next
analyze the phylogenetic relationships between all the
observed RD genes.

A difficulty has been documented in phylogenetic reconstruction of gene families with anciently duplicated genes
[26], in which saturation of frequently-mutating amino
acids leads to erroneous "outgroup topologies". In these
incorrect topologies, the duplication event appears to be
more ancient than supported by the data, which in turn
suggest the existence of lineage-specific gene loss events.
We tested our phylogenetic reconstruction using the program ASaturA [26], which identifies and suppresses saturated amino acids, thereby correcting the affected tree
topology. This analysis did not modify the location of

Using representative protein sequences of the RUNX and
RUNT genes (see Methods), we reconstructed a molecular
tree (Fig. 4, top left) showing the relationship between the
three RUNX proteins, FrRUNT and TnRUNT, and the runt
proteins of Ciona intestinalis and Branchiostoma floridae
(amphioxus). In this analysis, the FrRUNT protein is
nearly equidistant from the three RUNX proteins and
amphioxus RUNT (~72% identical, see Table 3). In comparison, the identity level between the RUNX proteins is
90%–98% in the same region (Table 3), and they are
90%–95% identical to amphioxus RUNT. Therefore,
while the amphioxus RUNT protein is very closely related
to the vertebrate RUNX, the pufferfish RUNT proteins are
significantly more divergent.

Localized high divergence between TnRUNT and FrRUNT
Localized high divergence between TnRUNT and FrRUNT. This alignment between the first 171 bp of the predicted TnRUNT
coding sequence, with the first 180 bp of FrRUNT, shows a cluster of mutations (curly brackets) around the N-terminus of the
runt domain (gray background). Non-conservative mutations (negative BLOSUM scores) are surrounded with thick black
frames; thin frames enclose conservative mutations, and synonymous mutations are not indicated. The first sixteen codons
derive from exon 1, the rest of the alignment from exon 2. The secondary structures indicated (alpha helix, beta strands and
loops) are after [21].

FrRUNT and TnRUNT in our reconstruction, suggesting
that mutational saturation is not causing the observed
divergence age of the pufferfish RUNT genes.
In this protein-level comparison of the conserved runt
domains, the pufferfish RUNT proteins appear to be surprisingly ancient, predating the divergence between craniates (including vertebrates) and cephalochordates
(including amphioxus). On the other hand, when com-

paring the nucleotide sequences of the first exon from
each human and fugu runt domain gene, we observed that
FrRUNT is more closely related to RUNX2 (Fig. 4, top
right), suggesting the possibility of a recombination event
between these genes (see discussion below).
We also studied the relationships between the RUNX1,
RUNX2 and RUNX3 orthologs in several vertebrates and
found the species trees to be largely as expected (Fig. 4,

bottom row). One of the two zebrafish RUNX2 protein
sequences (RUNX2A) appeared to be slightly more closely
related to tetrapod RUNX2 genes than to the other
RUNX2 genes in fish species, including zebrafish
RUNX2B (dashed branch in Fig. 4, RUNX2 panel). We
tested this result using ASaturA [26], and found it to be an
artifact of mutational saturation: in the corrected tree (Fig.
4), RUNX2A is more closely related to the other fish
RUNX2 genes.
Comparative genomics of runt domain genes
Four RD genes have been identified in Drosophila [14],
more similar to each other than to the vertebrate RUNX
genes: they represent an independent family expansion in
insects. The four Drosophila RD genes are all linked on
chromosome X. Moreover, three of these genes are clustered within a 150 kb region. There is no linkage of RD
genes, however, in the human genome: each gene is on a
different chromosome. Their genomic environments usually show some conservation: the three human RUNX
genes are followed by CLIC genes in the complementary
strand (Fig. 5), and linked to members of the DSCR1 family. The RD genes appear not to be clustered in the fugu
genome, though this conclusion is limited by the fragmentary nature of the current genome draft. All four fugu
RD genes are flanked by at least one non-RD gene on each
side. Fugu RUNX genes are followed by CLIC genes except
for FrRUNX1, but a CLIC gene is located ~55 kb upstream
of FrRUNX1 and in the same orientation. This organization could have arisen by an inversion event in the fugu
lineage. To ensure a misassembly did not cause this apparent inversion, we performed a 3x shotgun sampling of the
BAC clone OML73850, which spans the range 1–97413 of
scaffold 682. This quality control step failed to uncover
any misassemblies, and confirmed the genomic organization observed in this fugu scaffold. FrRUNT does not
appear to be linked to any CLIC gene, and no DSCR1 family members can be discerned near any of the fugu RD
genes.

When studying the wider genomic environments of fugu
and human RD genes, we observed significant synteny
conservation, in agreement with the observations
reported for chromosome X genes [27]. Indeed, when
comparing each of the genes neighboring fugu RUNX
genes to the human genome, we find that their orthologs
tend to be located in the corresponding human chromosome, e.g. most of the genes linked to FrRUNX3 have
orthologs on human chromosome 1, where human
RUNX3 resides (Fig. 5). Some inversion events can be
inferred, e.g. one involving the genes PHIP and IRAK1BP1
and another involving MUT. Gene order and orientation
has changed, and intergenic distances have changed drastically, but the overall gene synteny is largely preserved,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/43

lending support to the assignments of orthology between
the human and fugu RUNX gene pairs.
An exception to the conservation of synteny involves the
genes CDC5L and SUPT3H, which in the human genome
are found immediately upstream of RUNX2, but in fugu
are instead located upstream of FrRUNT, including the
first-exon interlocking with SUPT3H mentioned earlier.
Evidence points at a larger duplication in fishes, encompassing at least CDC5L, SUPT3H, RUNX2, CLIC5, ENPP4
and ENPP5, followed by differential gene loss. One duplicate copy would have retained FrRUNX2, CLIC5 and
ENPP5 (see Fig. 5), while the other copy (currently represented by scaffolds 835 and 376) would have retained
CDC5L, SUPT3H, a second RD gene, a second copy of
CLIC5 (CLIC5L) and ENPP4. The presence of remnants of
SUPT3H upstream of FrRUNX2 [13], and of two copies of
RUNX2 in zebrafish, lends further support to this hypothesis. Thus, comparative genomic analysis of human, fugu
and zebrafish suggests that FrRUNT may be a derivative
form of a duplicated RUNX2 gene. However, this contradicts the conclusions from phylogenetic analysis or the
protein sequences; we discuss this contradiction below.
A new family of follistatin-like genes
We find several fugu genes for which no human ortholog
can be discerned (green features in Fig. 5), among them
FrRUNT. Immediately downstream to FrRUNT we identified a novel gene (FrFSTL6) from the follistatin family,
most closely related to FSTL1. A detailed computational
search for additional sequences of this family identified
two novel, large human follistatin-like genes, which we
called FSTL4 and FSTL5. We then found clear orthologs
for both in the fugu genome (FrFSTL4 and FrFSTL5,
respectively). The genes in this family share a Kazal-type
cysteine-rich domain (Fig. 6a) and a calcium-binding EFhand domain (not shown).

Having characterized the complete gene family in both
human and fugu, we performed a phylogenetic reconstruction based on the conserved Kazal-type domain (Fig.
6b). FrFSTL6 appears to have no ortholog in the human
genome, nor could we identify a potential ortholog in the
mouse and frog genomes. This suggests that FrFSTL6 was
also lost in the tetrapod lineage. It is reasonable to
hypothesize that the neighboring FrRUNT and FrFSTL6
genes were lost in a single deletion event.

Discussion
We have taken advantage of the availability of genomic
drafts for several vertebrate species, including the finished
human genome, to identify the orthologs of all currently
known runt-domain (RD) genes, as well as a novel member of this small gene family. Both pufferfish species (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis) have four RD

genes; since these genomes are only available as draft
assemblies, additional RD genes might be found when the
finished genomic sequences are made available.
The function of the novel FrRUNT/TnRUNT gene is currently unknown. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, this
novel gene appears to represent an ancestral form of the
RD family in vertebrates, subsequently lost in the tetrapod
lineage. It is therefore surprising that its gene structure,
and not that of RUNX2 as in humans, is interlocked with
the SUPT3H gene. Based on the comparative genomics
analysis alone, one could hypothesize that FrRUNT is
simply a derivative form of RUNX2, i.e. the ortholog of

zebrafish RUNX2A. In this case, though, one would expect
FrRUNT to be more similar to FrRUNX2 than it is to either
FrRUNX1 or FrRUNX3, but in terms of amino acid
sequence similarity, it appears to be equidistant from the
three RUNX genes. This discrepancy might be explained
by invoking accelerated evolution of the pufferfish RUNT
genes, perhaps as a lineage-specific adaptation. Typically,
nucleotide sequences diverge much faster than amino
acid sequences, and the first exons of RD genes are significantly less conserved than the runt domain itself, on
which we based our phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, we
find it hard to sustain that, while the first exon of FrRUNT
maintains its nucleotide similarity to the first exon of

RUNX2, the amino acid sequence of the (normally highly
conserved) runt domain itself has diverged at such an
accelerated pace. Furthermore, we found this not to be an
artifact of mutational saturation [26]. A similar situation
is observed for the neighboring FSTL6 gene: parsimony
considerations could lead one to assume that FSTL6 is a
fish-specific duplicate of FSTL1, though contradicting the
phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolution of this gene
family (Fig. 6). This situation could again be explained by
assuming accelerated evolution of FSTL6, but we consider
this to be a remarkable coincidence.
The conundrum is whether FrRUNT is an ancestral form,
or is derived from RUNX2. Both hypotheses contradict
part of the available data. We propose here a third hypothesis, in the form of an evolutionary history (see Fig. 7): An
ancestral RD gene duplicated in chordates, after divergence from sea urchin, which has a single RD gene [17].
One of the two resulting RD genes became the RUNX family founder, which expanded by triplication, and one of
the three RUNX genes (namely RUNX2) became interlocked with SUPT3H. After the teleost/tetrapod divergence, a regional duplication in teleosts created a second
copy of RUNX2 and its neighboring genes. In the tetrapod
lineage, the ancestral RUNT gene was lost, in conjunction
with FSTL6. In the pufferfish lineage, the RUNT gene
replaced most of RUNX2A, perhaps by recombination
(Fig. 8). This is supported by the clear similarity between
the first exons of FrRUNT and RUNX2. The copy of
SUPT3H interlocked with RUNX2B, apparently superfluous, is being lost by gradual degradation, and only small
fragments of it remain [13]. This scenario is compatible
with all the data observed. While it posits a small number
of additional evolutionary events, it does not involve
highly improbable events like the accelerated evolution of
a normally highly conserved protein structural domain.
Interestingly, the first duplication event could correspond
to the first round of vertebrate genome tetraploidization
[28]. A second round of tetraploidization in the ancestral
vertebrate could have produced a set of four paralogous
runt domain genes, and a hypothetical gene conversion
event may have led to the current complement of three
RUNX genes (Fig. 7 inset). Conversion between paralogous copies of genes derived from tetraploidization events
has been demonstrated [29].
Under the proposed scenario, none of the three extant
RUNX genes in mammals represents the ancestral vertebrate RD form. Rather, these derivative genes coexisted
with an additional RUNT gene and still do so in teleost
genomes. The single known RD gene in amphioxus is
more similar to the vertebrate RUNX genes than it is to
FrRUNT. It is possible, therefore, that cephalochordates
(including amphioxus) have a second RD gene, short and
divergent enough to escape experimental detection by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/43

DNA hybridization [17]. Why was one of the ancestral RD
genes lost in the tetrapod lineage? The three RUNX genes
bind to the same DNA motif and modify the expression of
target genes through recruitment of transcriptional modulators, which are also shared [30]; functional differences
between the three RUNX genes are attained by way of
tightly regulated spatiotemporal expression patterns. We
hypothesize that the ancestral RUNT gene became inessential to amniotes by functional reprogramming of the
remaining three RUNX genes. Its loss would therefore represent an example of evolution by reduction in complexity. In pufferfishes, the hypothesized recombination event
would have placed the RUNT gene under the regulatory
control of the former RUNX2A promoter. The viability of
such a sudden regulatory change would in turn suggest a
significant level of functional redundancy among the RD
genes.

Conclusions
We identified a fourth runt domain gene in the fugu
genome, which appears to represent either a pufferfishspecific, fast-evolving derivative of RUNX2, or a direct
descendant of the ancestral chordate RUNT gene. We find
the latter hypothesis more reasonable. This novel gene
evolved in parallel with the vertebrate RUNX genes, and
while it has been preserved in pufferfishes, it appears to
have been lost entirely in tetrapods. This suggests that the
ancestral vertebrate was more complex than previously
suspected.
By studying a very limited set of fugu genomic regions,
namely the scaffolds related to RD genes, we have
identified seven apparently functional fugu genes that are
absent from the human genome (Fig. 5), and were probably lost early in tetrapod history. In the process of identifying relevant homologs for one of these genes (FrFSTL6),
we have identified a new family of follistatin-like genes in
the human genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the RD protein sequences led to results that contradict those derived
from comparative genomics, but we showed that the two
could be reconciled into a coherent evolutionary model.
These results underscore the importance of obtaining
complete genomic sequences of strongly divergent vertebrates, and the value to be derived by performing detailed
and integrated analyses of their gene complements.

Methods
Search for RD genes
We used the human RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3 proteins (SwissProt entries Q01196, Q13950 and Q13761,
respectively) as queries in a TFASTY [31] search into the
Takifugu rubripes "assembly3" genome draft [32] released
after publication of the fugu genome [33]. These data have
been provided freely by the Fugu Genome Consortium for
use in this publication only. This search resulted in the

unambiguous identification of four complete RD genes in
scaffolds 183, 260, 682 and 835. Scaffold 25789 is nearly
identical with range 115299–115845 of scaffold 183, partially overlapping the last exon of FrRUNX3. No further
evidence was found for an additional RUNX3 gene: we
conclude that scaffold 25789 is an assembly artifact. We
similarly searched the genome drafts for Tetraodon nigroviridis produced by the Whitehead Institute and the Genoscope [23], and Danio rerio (Zv1/06 assembly, which was
produced by the Zebrafish Sequencing Group at the
Sanger Institute [24]. We analyzed, visualized and annotated all resulting genomic sequences using the GESTALT
Workbench [20,34], and produced a detailed gene model
for each RD gene. Lacking cDNA or EST data, we recon-

structed the putative gene structures by maximizing similarity to known RD proteins. Genomic sequence data have
been submitted to GenBank with accessions AY739093AY739096; the predicted sequences for fugu RD proteins
have accessions AAU14190-AAU14193.
In a second round of analysis, we used the newly identified RD genes as queries for renewed TFASTY searches of
the genome drafts of human (July 03), mouse (February
03), Xenopus [35] (December 03 assembly) and Ciona
intestinalis [36]. We also used BLAT to search into the
updated "freezes" of human (May 04), chimp (November
03), mouse (May 04), rat (June 03), dog (July 04), and
chicken (Feb 04).

vided by Dr. Greg Elgar. PCR products were purified with
sephacryl (Amersham Pharmacia) and sequenced directly
using Applied Biosystems Big dye terminator kit reagents.
Whenever necessary, additional pairs of primers were
designed for oligonucleotide-directed sequencing to close
gaps. Shotgun sequencing data was obtained from the
BAC clone OML73850 (b193C08) for part of scaffold
682. OML73850 was fragmented by sonication, endrepaired and electrophoresed to select insert size of 2–5
kb. Insert was ligated into pUC18 vector, transformed and
plasmid DNA was made using Eppendorf – 5 Prime
PERFECTprep robot and sequenced from both ends.
Assembly was carried out using Phrap [38]. Analysis of the
resulting sequence shows that OML73850 spans the first
97413 bp of scaffold 682, and links it to scaffold 4260.
The additional sequence data generated in-house were
combined with the consensus sequences of the scaffolds
produced by the JGI WGS assembly v.3 for the purpose of
producing a contiguous sequence for each scaffold.

observed in pufferfishes, and may have been lost in evolution.

Sequence finishing
Large insert clones spanning the gaps in scaffolds from the
version 3 assembly were identified by BLAST searches
against the BAC/cosmid database in the v.3.0 JGI website
[37]. Cosmids (cloned in Lawrist4) were grown in LB
media with kanamycin at 37 ° C for 14 hrs, and DNA was
prepared on the Autogen 740 DNA Isolation system in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. BACs
(cloned in pBeloBAC 11) were similarly prepared by
growing in media with chloramphenicol. Primers were
designed in both directions, across all gaps. Oligonucleotide-directed sequencing from clones and Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) methods were used to fill the gaps.
PCR amplification was performed on spanning BAC/cosmid or genomic DNA of Takifugu rubripes, generously pro-

Phylogenetic reconstruction
The sequences were aligned using ClustalW [39]. Phylogenetic trees were built using the neighbor-joining algorithm [40] and tested with 1000 rounds of bootstrapping.
Graphics were produced with TreeView [41]. Since fulllength protein sequences cannot be reliably aligned for
extremely divergent RD genes, we used only the runt
domain to reconstruct the relationship between the pufferfish RUNT, human RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3
(NP_00175, NP_033950 and NP_004341, respectively),
ciona (C. intestinalis) RUNT, Oikopleura dioica RUNT
(AAS21356), amphioxus (B. floridae) RUNT (AY146617),
sea urchin S. purpuratus RUNT (NP_999779) and the four
Drosophila melanogaster RD sequences (NP_523424,
NP_511099, NP_572693 and NP_608398). The tree was
rooted using the C. elegans RUN protein (AB027412) as
outgroup. We further excluded the first thirteen amino
acids of the runt domain, to avoid the topological distortion expected in this region from the highly divergent
pufferfish RUNT sequences. For the separate phylogenetic
trees of the three RUNX genes, we used the complete protein sequences, with gap opening and extension penalties
of 5 and 0.1, respectively. ASaturA analyses were
performed using PAM250, Kimura's correction and a cutoff value of 9, with 1000 rounds of bootstrap. The first
exons of human and fugu runt domain genes were compared at the nucleotide level. For each exon, we selected
the range from 30 nucleotides upstream of the ATG
codon, to 15 downstream of the splicing donor site, i.e.
