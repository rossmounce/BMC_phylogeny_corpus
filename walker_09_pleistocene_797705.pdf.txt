Abstract
Background: Species that are widespread throughout historically glaciated and currently nonglaciated areas provide excellent opportunities to investigate the role of Pleistocene climatic
change on the distribution of North American biodiversity. Many studies indicate that northern
animal populations exhibit low levels of genetic diversity over geographically widespread areas
whereas southern populations exhibit relatively high levels. Recently, paleoclimatic data have been
combined with niche-based distribution modeling to locate possible refugia during the Last Glacial
Maximum. Using phylogeographic, population, and paleoclimatic data, we show that the distribution
and mitochondrial data for the millipede genus Narceus are consistent with classical examples of
Pleistocene refugia and subsequent post-glacial population expansion seen in other organismal
groups.
Results: The phylogeographic structure of Narceus reveals a complex evolutionary history with
signatures of multiple refugia in southeastern North America followed by two major northern
expansions. Evidence for refugial populations were found in the southern Appalachian Mountains
and in the coastal plain. The northern expansions appear to have radiated from two separate
refugia, one from the Gulf Coastal Plain area and the other from the mid-Atlantic coastal region.
Distributional models of Narceus during the Last Glacial Maximum show a dramatic reduction from
the current distribution, with suitable ecological zones concentrated along the Gulf and Atlantic
coastal plain. We found a strong correlation between these zones of ecological suitability inferred
from our paleo-model with levels of genetic diversity derived from phylogenetic and population
estimates of genetic structuring.
Conclusion: The signature of climatic change, during and after the Pleistocene, on the distribution
of the millipede genus Narceus is evident in the genetic data presented. Niche-based historical
distribution modeling strengthens the conclusions drawn from the genetic data and proves useful
in identifying probable refugia. Such interdisciplinary biogeographic studies provide a
comprehensive approach to understanding these processes that generate and maintain biodiversity
as well as the framework necessary to explore questions regarding evolutionary diversification of
taxa.

Background
The profound effect of Pleistocene glaciation upon species
distributions in the Northern Hemisphere has been well
documented [1-7]. As continental ice sheets advanced
into temperate areas, rendering once suitable areas uninhabitable, many northern taxa experienced extreme range
reduction and fragmentation into refugia, while other
populations and taxa were decimated entirely. Subsequently, as the ice sheets receded, recolonization of these
historically glaciated areas by northernmost populations
in refugia occurred rapidly. The genetic population structure in these organisms often reflects geological patterns
[1,2,7]. Rapid, post-glacial expansions distribute internal
(ancestral) haplotypes throughout large, previously glaciated, geographic areas. Furthermore, exponential growth
of founding populations and subsequent resource competition may prevent other refugial populations from
expanding simultaneously [4]. Taxa currently occupying
previously glaciated and historically unsuitable areas are
often characterized by low levels of genetic diversity [13,5-7].
Approximately 22,000 to 19,000 years before present, global temperatures were significantly lower than today and
the volume of land-based ice was at its maximum [8].
Recently, niche-based species' distribution modeling has
been applied to construct habitat suitability models for
taxa during the Last Glacial Maximum [9-11]. Increasing
availability of high-resolution temporal and spatial paleoclimatic data have greatly aided and improved fine-scale
modeling of species' historical geographic movements.
The number of studies showing the presence of genetic
signatures indicative of glacial refugia among terrestrial
and aquatic species has increased dramatically since the
1990's [4,10]. These models provide a relatively novel
approach to exploring historical distributions of species,
as they often coincide with previously hypothesized refugial regions [10].
The millipede genus Narceus Rafinesque 1820 (Diplopoda, Spirobolida) is widely distributed throughout eastern North America with populations currently located in
both historically glaciated and un-glaciated regions [12].
Narceus ranges from southern Quebec south through the
Florida Keys and west to central Texas. Narceus specimens
(Figure 1) are relatively large, cylindrical millipedes commonly found in Appalachian mixed mesophytic deciduous forests. They are primarily nocturnal, burrowing in
rotten logs or leaf litter during the day and roaming about
the forest floor or climbing trunks of large trees throughout the night. During the winter, they burrow deep into
soil and re-emerge in the spring to feed on dead tree material and mate. Narceus are some of the most commonly
encountered millipedes in the Appalachian Mountains
(often referred to as iron worms by locals). They are often

seen in large numbers just after rainfall or sometimes during the night. Whereas most millipedes are intolerant of
dry, warm temperatures, Narceus species seem to have a
wide range of moisture and heat tolerance and are often
encountered crossing asphalt roads during the summer.
Consequently their dispersal and colonization capabilities are likely greater than other co-distributed millipede
groups (e.g., litter-dwellers like the orders Chordeumatida
and Polydesmida).
With the exception of one morphologically distinct species in Florida, populations of Narceus appear phenotypically homogeneous throughout their range. However,
their rather simplified morphology and current nomenclature belie a number of taxonomic complexities that
have historically plagued this geographically widespread
genus. At present, the genus comprises three species (N.
americanus, N. annularis, and N. gordanus), which contain
no fewer than 16 synonyms. Although resolving the taxonomy of this group is not our primary focus, the complex history of the genus (discussed herein) has likely
contributed to confusing species boundaries within this
ubiquitous and interesting group of millipedes. Given the
history (evolution and nomenclatural) of the genus, as
suggested by Shelley [13], molecular data are likely
needed to begin to properly disentangle the species limits
within Narceus. The union of phylogeographic and population genetic principles provides the toolkit necessary to
investigate the historical distribution of these lineages
and, ultimately, helps disclose the mechanisms that maintain current levels of diversity and population structuring.
Here we present the first phylogeographic study of the
genus Narceus. We show that the genetic structure and current distribution of the genus Narceus (east of the Mississippi) reflects a complex history of refugia in the
Appalachian Mountains and coastal plain of North America. We examine our data for patterns that should be consistent with a Pleistocene refugia hypothesis. First, there

should be a profile of phylogeographic and genetic diversity that distinguishes coastal plain versus all other populations. Secondly, populations currently occupying
historically unsuitable habitat should show genetic signatures of rapid range expansion. And last, high probability
of habitat suitability from paleo-models of historical distributions should be coincident with those populations
having relatively higher levels of genetic diversity.

Results
Summary of data and phylogenetic analyses
Mitochondrial sequence data (1354 bp) were obtained for
individuals (n = 269) from 96 localities; 427 positions
were parsimony informative (GenBank accession numbers FJ213618-FJ213764). The average ingroup sequence
divergence was 7.3% with a range of < 0.01% – 14.6%.
Most localities are represented by > 3 individuals. However at 10 localities we were only able to obtain a single
individual. One hundred and fifty-three unique haplotypes were recovered following alignment. Twelve of these
haplotypes were found at multiple localities, one of which
occurred at 12 widely distributed northern localities. Of
the 86 localities surveyed where more than a single individual was sampled (90%), 21 contained a single haplotype.

For the Bayesian analysis, GTR + I + Γ model of molecular
evolution was inferred for the 16S region and HKY + I for
both the tRNA-Val and 12S partitions. Of 8 million generations, 800,000 were discarded as burnin, resulting in a
tree with a mean ln-likelihood value of -9768.09.
The Bayesian phylogeny (Figure 2) shows four distinct
groups: 1) a Texas and Louisiana clade, 2) a Southern
Appalachian clade, 3) a clade corresponding to the morphologically distinct Narceus gordanus (Chamberlin,
1943), and 4) a large, widely distributed sister clade to N.
gordanus [14]. We used statistical parsimony at a 95% confidence level, implemented by TCS [15], to subdivide this
larger clade. With a 95% reconnection limits most clades
were connected, however, by relaxing the confidence level
to 90% (a reasonable level given the relatively high
ingroup sequence divergence) the networks were more
inclusive and reflected the major clades recovered in the
Bayesian tree with a higher degree of precision. Six networks (Figure 3) and two unconnected haplotypes were
recovered, all of which agreed with the topology of the
Bayesian phylogeny: a Northwestern clade, a Northern
clade, two small Mississippi/Louisiana networks, a widespread Southeastern clade, a Florida panhandle/southern
Appalachian clade, and two haplotypes that fall out on a
single branch sister to the northern clade (Figures 2 &4).
Most nodes are highly supported with posterior probabilities > 0.95 and, with the exception of two interior nodes
and several very shallow nodes, all others are well sup-

northern clades reveal star-like patterns around each of
the widespread haplotypes, a pattern indicative of the
rapid expansion of ancestral haplotypes over a large geographic area [16,17].
Phylogeography
Tests for isolation by distance were significant in all clades
except the Northwestern clade (r = 0.0977, P = 0.2450)
and a subclade of the Northern clade (r = 0.1345, P =
0.059). Although it is one of the more widespread clades,
isolation by distance was not predicted in the Northwestern clade as it exhibits low levels of sequence divergence
relative to the other clades in the phylogeny. Mismatch
distribution plots (Figure 5) were multimodal in most
cases, although the above-mentioned subclade of the
Northern clade showed a smooth, unimodal curve. Fu's Fs

Niche-based distribution model constructed in MAXENT using current and Pleistocene climatic parameters
for Narceus. The models show the predicted distribution (habitat suitability) of Narceus during (a) the present and (b) the Last
Glacial Maximum. Distribution models illustrate high levels of predicted habitat suitability in red and low levels in blue.

distribution model (Figure 6b) for Narceus during the
Pleistocene shows a major reduction in habitat suitability
during the Last Glacial Maximum. The highest probabilities of occurrence, representing ecological suitability during the Pleistocene, are found along the Gulf coast,
throughout the Florida peninsula, and a minimal stretch
of the Atlantic coast (Figure 6b). Tests for significant correlation between genetic diversity (Table 1; mean pairwise
difference; π; ; [18]) and regions of habitat suitability in
the paleoclimatic distribution model were all significant
(rs = 0.296, P < 0.001; rs = 0.308, P < 0.001; rs = 0.362, P <
0.001 respectively), showing a correlation between the
observed high levels of genetic diversity and areas of Pleistocene refugia identified using the niche-based distribution model.
When we optimize the character "coastal plain" onto the
haplotype phylogeny and then compare it to the optimization of suitable habitat during the Pleistocene (derived
from the 0.2 threshold value in the MAXENT output) we
find a very high level of similarity (Figure 7); we only
recovered a single haplotype with a high probability of
paleo-model habitat suitability not located in the coastal
plain. A large majority of the coastal plain haplotype lineages occupy areas that would have been suitable refugia.
Furthermore, each clade with a coastal plain interior node
has a non-coastal plain sister clade. The Mississippi/Louisiana clade is sister to the exclusively non-coastal, shallowly divergent Northwestern clade; likewise, the Florida
panhandle/Southern Appalachian clade is sister to the
Southeastern clade, which comprises a non-coastal sister
to a subclade showing a radiation from and back to the
coastal plain. Genetic diversity for the coastal clade con-

sisting of only two haplotypes (NCCR02II and NCCR02I)
could not be calculated due to limited sampling. However, we do see a pattern similar to other sister clades
within the tree.

Discussion
Using an integrative approach that employs genetic and
geospatial data, this study provides a straightforward
example of Pleistocene refugia and post-glacial colonization. The star-like patterns and widely distributed haplotypes in our phylogeographic analyses taken together with
significantly negative Fu's Fs values, support two major
rapid expansions from coastal refugia into northern, historically glaciated areas. The southern populations of
Narceus are characterized by relatively high levels of
genetic diversity, isolation by distance, multimodal mismatch distributions, and an absence of widely distributed
ancestral haplotypes. Similar genetic patterns across geographic regions attributed to Pleistocene related phenomena have been detected in numerous animals including
salamanders [5,6], frogs [19], voles [20], mice [21], bears
[3], and grasshoppers [22]. Our niche-based paleodistribution model also provides compelling evidence for
southern refugia, specifically relegated to the coastal
plain.
Pleistocene refugia and post-glacial expansion
Glacial pulses during the Pleistocene profoundly affected
animal distributions in North America, and species in the
genus Narceus are no exception. As continental glaciers
advanced, the destruction of habitat necessitated the displacement or extinction of northern taxa. Populations of
displaced northern taxa suffered severe bottlenecks and

high levels of diversity [4]. An example of this phenomenon was provided by Church et al. [5] in eastern tiger salamanders. They showed a distinct split between eastern
and western populations. Within the eastern lineage, two
possible refugia were identified: the Blue Ridge Mountains and the coastal plain of the Carolinas. They hypothesized that the populations located in mountain refugia
have remained isolated after deglaciation whereas the
coastal plain refugia were the source for northern post-glacial expansion along the east coast.
We found a similar pattern in Narceus. The basal-most
clade in the phylogeny (Southern Appalachian) occurs
south of any previously glaciated areas in the southern
Appalachians, with populations from the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia to the southern extent of Appalachia in eastern Alabama. This clade also exhibits isolation
by distance and relatively high levels of genetic diversity
with no unique haplotypes occupying more than a single
locality. The Texas/Louisiana clade, the next basal-most
clade, also demonstrates the genetic signature of a refugial
past. Within the Texas/Louisiana clade, mismatch distributions (Figure 5) indicate highly fragmented populations [23], with each locality sampled having at least one
unique haplotype – another common characteristic of refugia populations [24,25]. With our sampling scheme, we
found a single distributional extension into northern
Indiana (Figures 2 &4), at first believed to be an anthropogenic introduction. However, we did detect isolation by
distance within this clade. Without further sampling, the
phylogenetic placement of this population remains enigmatic. A similar pattern of radiation was detected between
the Mississippi/Louisiana clade and its sister, the Northwestern clade (Figures 2 &4).

persisted during glacial advances were able to maintain

The Mississippi/Louisiana clade exhibits isolation by distance, relatively high levels of genetic diversity, and a lack
of shared haplotypes among localities – all characteristics
consistent with a deep refugial history [4,6]. Its sister, the
Northwestern clade, is widely distributed west of the
Appalachians (Figure 4). This clade exhibits relatively low
levels of genetic divergence and is distributed across a
large geographic distance. It also contains a single haplotype (ILOJ514II) found in eight localities in four states
(Illinois, West Virginia, Virginia, and Tennessee). The haplotype network indicates six other haplotypes connected
to ILOJ514II by = 2 mutational steps, resulting in a starlike pattern (Figure 3). A pattern also observed for rapidly
expanded populations of spotted salamanders [6], wood
frogs [19], and other taxa [17,21,26-29]. The star-like pattern and the mismatch plot of pairwise differences in the
Northwestern clade (Figure 5) are both consistent with
relatively rapid expansion, as might be expected for a
quick founding colonization into a newly deglaciated
suitable area. Indeed, the results of the paleodistribution

models (Figure 6) show that the majority of habitat currently occupied by the Northwestern clade was likely

the Appalachians, resembling that of the Texas/Louisiana
clade.

barrier into the southern Appalachians. The Fall Line (the
interface between the coastal plain and the Appalachian
foothills) does not seem to prevent radiations of these
millipedes; the area immediately east and running northto-south of the ACF basin may serve as a riparian corridor
from the coastal plain to the southern Appalachians [33].

Similar to patterns found in eastern tiger salamanders [5],
we detected a radiation from the mid-Atlantic coastal
plain north through upstate New York; however, this radiation appears to have extended west as well, like that seen
in the spotted salamander (Figure 4) [6]. The Northern
clade has three widely distributed haplotypes all of which
show star-like TCS networks (Figure 3). Fu's Fs, an indicator of rapid range expansion [30,31], was significant and
negative for the Northern clade. Despite multiple lines of
evidence indicating rapid range expansion, isolation by
distance was detected for this clade. Although long-distance dispersal can also account for patterns similar to
those seen for this clade, millipedes are non-vagile and
thus unlikely to disperse, via a single event, across a long
distance. Therefore, the phylogeographic pattern is more
likely the result of rapid range expansion.

Paleodistribution modeling
High-resolution models of past distributions for species
provide a promising new tool in the field of phylogeography [9,10]. A recent study by Waltari et al. [10] addressed
concordance between Pleistocene refugia predicted using
traditional biogeographic methods and niche-based paleodistribution modeling. Fourteen of the twenty North
American terrestrial taxa tested showed significant spatial
correlations between traditional and niche-based modeling methods for identifying Pleistocene refugia [10].
Agreement between these methods suggests that paleodistribution models may well provide useful guidelines for
biogeographic studies.

The Southeastern and Florida panhandle/southern Appalachian clades represent separate refugial populations that
have remained isolated. The Southeastern clade indicates
a rather complex phylogeographic pattern in which mismatch plots and isolation by distance analyses were consistent with those of refugial populations. However, Fu's
Fs was significant and negative in the Southeastern clade,
suggesting a rapid expansion. This clade is widespread
throughout the southeast, and character map reconstructions suggest multiple radiations to and from the coastal
plain within this clade. These pulses may have been fairly
recent, a scenario consistent with significant negative values for Fs obtained here. The Florida panhandle/southern
Appalachian area represents a coastal refugium with an
east-to-west phylogeographic break at the Apalachicola/
Chattahoochee/Flint (ACF) River Basin, a well documented geographic barrier to gene flow for multiple taxa
[32]. There is a single radiation of these millipedes forming a monophyletic group extending southeast of the ACF

Our Last Glacial Maximum model for Narceus (Figure 6b)
indicates a major reduction in habitat suitability that
stands in stark contrast to the present-day model. Hypotheses of refugia along the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains
are consistent with indicated areas of highest predicted
suitability in the niche-based distribution models. The
character map of haplotypes by region, illustrates a disproportionate number of haplotypes from these areas on
the phylogeny (Figure 7). A correlation between genetic
diversity and habitat suitability from our Pleistocene
model suggests that the model's highest predicted probabilities, in fact, do show higher levels of genetic diversity
and are consistent with those patterns expected from refugial areas. These refugia hypotheses are consistent with all
mismatch plots and isolation by distance tests for clades
occurring in coastal areas.
Somewhat inconsistent with the refugia hypotheses was
the low habitat suitability modeled in the southern Appalachian and Texas coastal plain regions of our paleodistribution model. Although these areas show very low
probability (0.007% – 1.390%) of having suitable habitat

Page 7 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:25

during the Last Glacial Maximum (Figure 6), it is apparent
that millipede populations were able to survive there.
During the Last Glacial Maximum, suitable habitat in
these areas may have been reduced into numerous microrefugia within the overall southern Appalachian refugium
that could lead to the diversity currently found in these
clades. Under this hypothesis, overall habitat suitability
would appear to be very low; however, populations may
have
persisted
within
suitable
microrefugia.
Taxonomic considerations
As discussed in the Background section, Narceus presently
comprises three nominal species, two of which appear to
be morphologically homogenous. Narceus gordanus is the
only species that appears to be morphologically distinct
and has a rather limited distribution, endemic to peninsular Florida and extending north to South Carolina [34].
Individuals assigned to N. gordanus are represented in the
phylogeny (Figure 2) by a clade nested squarely within
populations that are morphologically indistinguishable
and clades that likely represent the remaining two species.
This phylogenetic placement renders N. americanus and
N. annularis (sensu lato) paraphyletic. Moreover, as has
been demonstrated for other millipede groups [e.g.,
Jamaican Anadenobolus; [35,36]], cryptic species may be a
problem for species delineation within this genus. Further
work will be needed to resolve these issues, both in terms
of careful morphological analyses and intensive collecting
west of the Mississippi. An integrative approach that takes
into account biogeographic patterns, analyses of morphology, phylogenetic history, and climatic envelope will
likely provide the framework necessary to investigate species boundaries in this widespread, morphologically
homogeneous genus [see [37]].

Conclusion
The signature of climatic change on the distribution of the
millipede genus Narceus is evident in the mtDNA data presented here. Niche-based historical distribution modeling
strengthens the conclusions drawn from the genetic data
and proves useful in identifying areas of probable Pleistocene refugia. This study provides the first molecular
phylogeographic and ecological modeling data for the
millipede genus Narceus. The methods used here provide
an integrative biogeographic approach to understand
processes generating patterns of biodiversity, and an
approach to explore the evolutionary diversification of
species, populations, and organismal distributions.

Methods
Molecular Protocols and sequence alignment
Live millipedes collected in the field were transported to
the laboratory, where legs or heads were removed and
stored in RNA later (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at -80°C.
Voucher specimens were stored in 80% ethanol and will

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/25

be eventually deposited in the Field Museum of Natural
History collection (Chicago, IL). Genomic DNA was
extracted from leg or head tissue using a Qiagen DNeasy
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and a mitochondrial
region spanning 12S, tRNA-Val, and 16S genes was amplified via a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
primers LR-J-12887dip (CCG GTC TGA AAC TCA GAT
CAT GT) and SR-N-145xxdip1 (GTA TAT CGC TGT CGT
CAG A). Products were column purified and sequenced
with an ABI Hitachi 3130 Genetic Analyzer and/or an ABI
PRISM 377 automated DNA sequencer. Raw sequence
data were edited with Sequencher 4.1. Multiple sequence
alignment was performed with MUSCLE [38]. Aligned
data were partitioned by comparison with a published
mitochondrial genome of Narceus [39].
Phylogenetic Analyses
One hundred and fifty three unique haplotypes (1354 bp)
were used as terminal taxa for phylogenetic analyses. The
molecular data were divided into 3 partitions: 16S, tRNAValine, and 12S. Models of nucleotide evolution for each
partition were selected using MRMODELTEST 2.2 [40]
following the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Phylogenetic reconstructions were created using both maximum likelihood in GARLI 0.95 (1000 bootstrap
replicates;
program
available
at
http://
www.bio.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/garli/Garli.html)
and Bayesian inference in MRBAYES 3.1.2 [41]. With
MRBAYES, two simultaneous analyses were run, each with
eight chains sampling every 100 generations. Convergence was assumed as the average standard deviation of
split frequencies stabilized below 0.01. TRACER 1.4
(available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer) was
employed to examine parameter values, and a majorityrule consensus tree was produced after the removal of
trees saved prior to burn-in. Statistical parsimony, as
implemented by TCS [15], was used as an unbiased criterion for assigning subclades.
Phylogeographic
Isolation by distance was tested within each major
mtDNA lineage using a Mantel test of correlation between
genetic and geographic distance matrices implemented in
the software package IBD [42]. Using DNASP [43], mismatch distributions of pairwise differences within each
major mtDNA lineage were produced and plotted against
the expected distributions under a null model of exponential population growth to explore the possibility of recent
range expansions [23]. Unimodal distributions are
expected for clades with recent population expansions,
whereas multimodal distributions are expected for clades
with more phylogeographic structure. In terms of refugia
scenarios, an unimodal distribution of pairwise differences would be expected for shallowly divergent lineages
that currently occupy previously glaciated areas, and mul-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:25

timodal distributions would be expected for deeply divergent lineages that currently occupy areas once suitable for
glacial refugia [28]. We employed DNASP to compute Fu's
Fs (1000 replicates), shown in a comparative study by
[30] to be one of the best indicators of rapid population
growth.
Phylogenetic patterns for coastal plain populations were
investigated by scoring haplotypes as coastal or "montane" and then using the parsimony character state reconstruction in MESQUITE [44] to optimize these two
character states onto the haplotype phylogeny. As a direct
confirmation to assess whether coastal plain regions may
have served as refugia for Narceus during the glacial maximum, values were extracted from the niche-based distribution model using the paleoclimatic data set (see
methods below). We scored two character states: 0) area
suitable during the Pleistocene (P ≥ 0.20); and 1) area
unsuitable during the Pleistocene (P < 0.20).
Distribution modeling
Niche-based distribution modeling explores algorithmic
approaches to extracting associations between geographical occurrence of species and a given set of environmental
variables. Once the relationships between species occurrences and environmental variables has been established,
predictions of the focal species' distribution and locations
of potentially suitable habitat can be generated [45,46].
Although most commonly employed to predict the current distribution of a species, distribution models can also
be projected onto hypothesized past and future environments to reconstruct a species distribution at any point in
time and space [9,11,47,48]. To compare the current distribution of Narceus with its predicted distribution during
the Last Glacial Maximum, we employed the program
MAXENT [45]. MAXENT is a machine-learning method
that estimates the least biased focal probability distribution by maximizing the distribution's entropy within the
constraints of the known data [45]. There are a variety of
algorithms and computer programs available for nichebased distribution modeling, but several studies have
shown MAXENT to be one of the more robust [45,49,50].
For our environmental data layers, we began with 19
standard temperature and precipitation variables based
on interpolated climate data at a resolution of 30 arc-seconds [WorldClim; [51]]. The values of each variable for
each specimen locality were extracted and analyzed for
correlation. Highly correlated variables (r-squared >= .85)
were subsequently removed resulting in ten non-redundant [52] environmental variables (Table 2). Paleodistribution models were based on a matching set of
environmental data layers for the Last Glacial Maximum.
The paleoclimatic layers for 21,000 years before present
were generated and provided by Richards et. al. [9] using
the Community Climate Model [53] which incorporates

atmospheric dynamics, including radiative and convective
processes, condensation, and evaporation.
We tested for significant correlations (Spearman's rho)
between the Pleistocene habitat suitability and genetic
diversity (mean pairwise difference; π; ) [18] among
major mtDNA lineages. Given that we have produced an
accurate model and the fact the Narceus have limited dispersal capabilities, we would expect to see higher levels of
genetic diversity in lineages currently occupying areas of
high habitat suitability in our Pleistocene distribution
model. Because MAXENT output is continuous, a threshold must be selected in order to create a binary distribution model where all pixels are either predicted as present
or absent (or suitable/unsuitable). We chose a conservative threshold based on the lowest predicted value associated with any of the observed sampling sites for the
current model [Pearson et. al.'s 'LPT'; [50]]. This approach
maintains a zero omission error (i.e., zero false negatives),
thereby maintaining that each pixel predicted "present"
has conditions at least as suitable as those where the species is known to occur [50]. This threshold was then
applied to the paleodistribution model and used as the
basis of a character matrix. Thus, each haplotype in the
inferred Bayesian phylogeny was marked as being located
in either suitable or unsuitable habitat during the Last
Glacial Maximum. Character maps were then reconstructed using parsimony in MESQUITE [44] to infer species movement and/or stasis between the past and
present. Haplotypes located in areas predicted as suitable
during the Last Glacial Maximum outline possible refugia
areas, while those in locations predicted as unsuitable
might be indicative of post-glacial range expansions.
