Abstract
Background: In a context of climate change, phenotypic plasticity provides long-lived species, such as trees, with
the means to adapt to environmental variations occurring within a single generation. In eucalyptus plantations,
water availability is a key factor limiting productivity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
adaptation of eucalyptus to water shortage remain unclear. In this study, we compared the molecular responses of
two commercial eucalyptus hybrids during the dry season. Both hybrids differ in productivity when grown under
water deficit.
Results: Pyrosequencing of RNA extracted from shoot apices provided extensive transcriptome coverage - a
catalog of 129,993 unigenes (49,748 contigs and 80,245 singletons) was generated from 398 million base pairs, or
1.14 million reads. The pyrosequencing data enriched considerably existing Eucalyptus EST collections, adding
36,985 unigenes not previously represented. Digital analysis of read abundance in 14,460 contigs identified 1,280
that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes, 155 contigs showing differential expression
between treatments (irrigated vs. non irrigated conditions during the dry season), and 274 contigs with significant
genotype-by-treatment interaction. The more productive genotype displayed a larger set of genes responding to
water stress. Moreover, stress signal transduction seemed to involve different pathways in the two genotypes,
suggesting that water shortage induces distinct cellular stress cascades. Similarly, the response of functional
proteins also varied widely between genotypes: the most productive genotype decreased expression of genes
related to photosystem, transport and secondary metabolism, whereas genes related to primary metabolism and
cell organisation were over-expressed.
Conclusions: For the most productive genotype, the ability to express a broader set of genes in response to water
availability appears to be a key characteristic in the maintenance of biomass growth during the dry season. Its
strategy may involve a decrease of photosynthetic activity during the dry season associated with resources
reallocation through major changes in the expression of primary metabolism associated genes. Further efforts will
be needed to assess the adaptive nature of the genes highlighted in this study.

Background
Planted forests constitute only 7% of the global forested
area, but contribute to a significant proportion of overall
forest goods and services (e.g. up to 35% of industrial
roundwood supply). In the context of climate change,
the adaptation of planted forests is essential for a sustainable forestry sector. The adaptation of industrial
plantations to present and future environmental

conditions (including extreme weather events) depends
on several factors, including the genetic diversity of the
material used for reforestation and the phenotypic plasticity of individual genotypes. Genetic diversity ensures
that forest trees can survive, adapt and evolve under
changing environmental conditions [1,2], whereas phenotypic plasticity constitutes a shorter term response to
environmental changes at the individual level of particular importance in long-lived organisms, such as trees
[2,3].
Eucalyptus is one of the key genera among planted
trees. The genus is includes the most important

hardwood fibre crops species planted worldwide (19 million hectares according to [4]). Several Eucalyptus species grow rapidly and are highly adaptable. These
properties led to their introduction worldwide, at latitudes extending from southern Europe to South Africa.
In its natural range (Australia and some nearby islands),
Eucalyptus are also found in a diverse spectrum of ecological niches. The genetic diversity of Eucalyptus has
been studied extensively and remarkable levels of variation have been detected using neutral markers [5-11]
and in genes possibly involved in adaptive traits [12-14].
Phenotypic plasticity is also likely to ensure better adaptation of individual genotypes to changing environmental conditions [15] and is of particular importance in
clonal forestry.
Ecophysiological studies have shown that water is the
principal factor limiting stem growth in Eucalyptus (e.g.
[16,17]). Moreover, some studies have reported that
eucalyptus genotypes differ in terms of their capacity for
phenotypic modification in response to water deficit
[18-20]. Several physiological mechanisms for coping
with drought have been described in these species: i) the
regulation of transpiration to decrease water loss [21],
ii) resource reallocation from the shoot to the root, to
increase water uptake [17], and iii) adjustment of osmotic potential [22] or protection against reactive oxygen
species, to prevent damage due to stress [20]. Drought
tolerance mechanisms have been described in detail at
the molecular level for both annual and perennial model
plants, such as Arabidopsis [23-25] and Populus [26-28],
but little is known about the molecular basis of drought
tolerance in Eucalyptus, particularly in field conditions.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides new
opportunities for studies of the molecular plasticity in
response to water deficit. The high throughput of NGS
is particularly useful in non-model organisms for which
few genomic resources are available [29]. Moreover,
NGS is suitable for transcript profiling, combining the
high throughput of serial analysis of gene expression
(SAGE) with the functional annotation capacity of EST
sequencing [30]. These techniques have been widely
used for transcriptome profiling, particularly for studies
of biotic [31] and abiotic [24] stress responses, and the
characterisation of developmental processes [32]. Considerable sequencing depth can be obtained, making it
possible to identify transcriptome expression variation
[29].
In plants, the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a key
organ in stem development. The SAM initiates phytomers and regulates shoot growth by integrating several
signals, such as hormones (ABA, auxins, cytokinins) and
transcription (e.g. homeobox) [33]. When plants are
subjected to environmental stimuli, the leaf developmental network is adjusted by changes in shoot apex

activation [34]. In Eucalyptus, EST resources have been
developed for various tissues, such as roots, leaves and
wood-forming tissues [35-38], but a limited number of
genomic resources are available for shoot apices, despite
the important role of this organ in plant organogenesis.
In this study, we compared transcript profiles in the
shoot apices of two eucalyptus genotypes used in industrial plantations, under two watering regimes – irrigated
(IR) versus non-irrigated (NI). The two genotypes differ
in their growth rates and ecophysiological characteristics
at maturity, with one genotype being more productive
and water use-efficient than the other. We used pyrosequencing (Roche 454) to sequence non-normalized
cDNA libraries constructed from shoot tip mRNA. After
verifying technical reproducibility, we addressed the following questions: i) Are there molecular differences
between genotypes, reflected in the contrasting phenotypes, and do these differences affect specific pathways
or have a random effect on the transcriptome? ii) Can
we detect molecular plasticity in the response to water
shortage during the dry season, and which pathways are
affected? iii) Does this plasticity differ between genotypes (i.e. is there any genotype-by-environment interaction?), and which genes or pathways reflect these
differences?

Methods
Plant material

We compared the response of two eucalyptus genotypes,
1-41 (NCBI Taxonomy ID: 764271) and 18-50 (NCBI
Taxonomy ID: 765255), to water shortage during the
dry season of 2008. These two genotypes are used in
industrial plantations in the Republic of Congo. Hybrid
1-41 (named G1 in the following sections) was obtained
by open pollination of E. alba (the male parent is
unknown) and the hybrid 18-50 (named G2) was
derived from a controlled pollination of E. urophylla
(genotype 14-36) by E. grandis (genotype 9-10). These
two hybrids differ in their growth rates and water use
efficiency (WUE, estimated by isotopic carbon composition) at maturity, G2 being superior than G1.
Field experiment

Trees were vegetatively propagated by rooted cuttings
and established in a field experiment in Yanika, Republic
of Congo (4°20’S, 11°38’E, 50 m above sea level), in June
2007. Trees were planted in plots of 64 cuttings per
genotype and per treatment, including a buffer zone of
40 plants. Two watering regimes were used during the
dry season: no irrigation (NI) and irrigation (IR). Trees
were watered with sprinklers, to replenish evapotranspiration losses, estimated at 3 mm per day. In order to
evaluate the effect of water deficit on above-ground biomass growth and molecular plasticity, plant material was

were planted. The dry season began approximately on

compartment. Total above-ground biomass (the sum of
all the compartment) was analysed by two-way
ANOVA, with R (R Development Core Team), according to the following model:

Soil water content

where Xijk is the above-ground biomass in genotype i
(G1 or G2), treatment j (NI or IR) and replicate k. a, b
and c are the regression coefficients of G, the genotypic
effect, T, the treatment effect and G × T the interaction
between genotype and treatment, and εijk is the residual.

Volumetric water content (VWC) was measured by time
domain reflectometry (TDR; Trase system, Soil moisture, Santa Barbara, CA). Four series of TDR probes per
genotype and per treatment were installed horizontally,
at six depths (0.15, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 m). Mean values
were calculated from the four replicated measurements
at each depth.
Biomass production

We harvested 11 trees per treatment and dissected them
into the following compartments: stem, dead branches,
living branches and leaves. Each compartment was
weighed in the field. Representative subsamples of each
compartment were then harvested, and weighed before
and after drying at 65 °C to constant weight. Water content was calculated for each of these subsamples and
used to estimate total dry biomass for each

Xijk = μ + a · Gi + b · Tj + c · (G × T)ij + εijk

cDNA synthesis

The experimental design, from tissue sampling to library
construction and sequencing, is described in figure 1.
Shoot apices were collected from three trees from each
genotype and treatment, and immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Two RNA extractions of three apices
from each tree were performed, as previously described
by Reid et al. [39]. RNA samples were treated with
Turbo RNase-Free DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA)
and purified with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA). RNA concentration and quality
were analysed with an Agilent Technologies 2100

Figure 1 Procedure used, from tissue sampling to sequencing. Two genotypes (G1 and G2) were subjected to two watering regimes (IR
and NI). Shoot apices from three trees per genotype and per treatment were collected in the field. Total RNA was extracted from three apices
per tree. Two replicate RNA extractions were carried out for the construction of two independent replicate cDNA libraries per genotype and per
treatment (resulting in 8 templates for cDNA library construction). For sequencing, each cDNA library was tagged, and two independent
multiplexes were created by pooling one sample for each genotype and treatment combination. Multiplex #1 was sequenced with two 454Roche FLX Titanium half-runs, resulting in eight sequencing sets, whereas multiplex #2 was sequenced with one half-run and resulted in four
sequencing sets.

Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON,
USA) and a ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop,
Wilmington, DE, USA). The three RNA preparations
per replicate and per condition (corresponding to three
trees), were pooled in equal proportions, providing templates for cDNA libraries S1-S8 (figure 1). Full-length
cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of RNA, with the Smart
cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. We amplified the cDNA with PCR Advantage II Polymerase (Clontech, Mountain View, CA,
USA), over 16 cycles (7 s at 95 C, 20 s at 66 °C, and 4
min at 72 °C). This cDNA amplification procedure was
repeated eight times in separate tubes for each sample,
with pooling to give a total of 6 μg of cDNA fragments
longer than 1,000 bp quantified with an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. Eight cDNA libraries (S1-S8)
were constructed, giving two biological replicates for the
two genotypes (G1, G2) subjected to the two watering
regimes (IR, NI).
Library construction, 454-sequencing, sequence quality
control and assembly

We nebulised 5 μg of each cDNA sample to a mean
fragment size of 650 bp and ligated it to an adaptor,
according to standard procedures [40]. Each cDNA
library was tagged with Multiplex Identifiers (MID) barcode adaptors, and two independent multiplexes were
created by pooling one sample from each genotype and
treatment. Multiplex #1 comprised samples S1, S3, S5
and S7, whereas muliplex #2 comprised samples S2, S4,
S6 and S8. One half-run (run A) of sequencing was
initially carried out for multiplex #1 on a GS-FLX Titanium platform (454 Life Science, Brandford, CT, USA)
at Cogenics (Meylan, France). Two half-runs of sequencing for multiplex #1 (run B) and multiplex #2 (run C)
were then performed by Agencourt (Beverly, MA, USA)
on a GS-FLX Titanium sequencer. Base calling with GSFLX System software generated 353,344 high-quality
reads for the first half-run and in 785,322 reads for the
second complete run. Sequences were deposited at the
NCBI short-read archive (SRA) under accession number
SRA012867.2 (Figure 2). The 454-sequencing reads
(1,138,666 from this study and 1,041,876 from Novaes et
al. [13]) were screened by cross_match (http://bozeman.
mbt.washington.edu/phrap.docs/phrap.html) for primers
and adaptors and then masked. For each 454-sequencing
read, the longest non-masked region was extracted and
further trimmed with SeqClean (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/). The shorter regions were discarded to
eliminate potential chimeras. Sequences were assembled
as previously described [41], with TGICL [42], using the
12 sets of sequencing data from this study and the four
sets of sequencing data obtained for E. grandis

[accession number SRA001122] by Novaes et al. [13]. In
parallel, all reads were stored in the NG6 system (http://
vm-bioinfo.toulouse.inra.fr/ng6/, project: BIOGECO
eucalyptus) and three kinds of analysis were performed
for each of the 16 sequencing sets, as previously
described [41]: i) BLAST search for E. coli, phage and
yeast contaminants, ii) read quality analysis and iii)
removal of sequences that were too long or too short,
sequences with an excess of errors (more than 4% of N),
low-complexity sequences and duplicated reads, using
Pyrocleaner program. Only unigene elements (UE)
resulting from sequences generated in this experiment
(the E.spp sequencing set) were used for digital gene
expression analysis.
Digital gene expression analysis

Contigs with less than 10 reads for the 12 sequencing
sets generated in this study were eliminated from
further statistical analyses. For the 14,460 remaining
contigs, the numbers of reads per sequencing set and
per contig were used to assess gene abundance. Two
types of statistical analysis were performed. First, pairwise comparisons were carried out between genotypes
(G2 vs. G1 sequencing sets, irrespective of treatment)
and between treatments (IR vs. NI sequencing sets, irrespective of genotype). Four additional comparisons were
carried out for each genotype and each treatment, as
follows: IR vs. NI for genotypes G1 and G2, G1 vs. G2
for treatments IR and NI. Statistical tests, based on the
use of the MARS method in the DEGseq package [43]
were performed to assess differential expression [43].
Second, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed on contigs, making use of the three replicates
(run A, B and C) per treatment to estimate random variation and test the genotype (G), treatment (T) and genotype-treatment interaction (GxT) effects. Transcript
abundance was normalized by dividing the number of
reads by the sequence length of the contigs and the
total number of sequences in each sequencing set. Contigs with a q-value <0.05 in the DEGseq test (i.e. after
false discovery rate corrections) [44] and with p-values
<0.05 after ANOVA were considered to be differentially
expressed and were extracted for further analysis. The
14,460 genes analysed were classified into four classes:
not significantly differentially expressed (NS), and showing genotype ("G” contigs), treatment ("T” contigs) or
genotype × treatment ("GxT” contigs) effects. For the
comparison of expression levels, we used log2 -transformed fold-changes between contig abundances in the
various contrasts obtained in the DEGseq analysis.
Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes

Contigs were assigned a putative function by BLASTX
[45], using various public databases: UniProtKB/Swiss-

Differentially expressed contigs were assigned to functional categories (or bins) by Mercator (http://mapman.

Results
Monitoring of soil water content

A factorial design including two genotypes (G1 and G2)
and two water regimes (irrigated IR vs. non-irrigated
NI) was established in a field trial in one of the main
areas of eucalyptus plantation in the Republic of Congo.
The experiment was evaluated over a period of two
years. Soil water content (SWC) was monitored
throughout the experiment at six depths (0.15-4 m), to
assess water availability in different experimental conditions. In this study, we focus on the effect of water
availability in the second dry season (after four months
without rainfall) on biomass production and the
transcriptome.
In the NI treatment, SWC varied from 4.5% to 8%,
and no significant difference was found between the two
genotypes (Figure 3). SWC values were close to wilting
point (pF 4.2), i.e., when plants ceased to be able to
absorb soil water. In the IR treatment, SWC ranged

GxT interaction effect was not significant (Additional
file 1), but relative biomass loss was nonetheless lower
for genotype G2 (12%) than for genotype G1 (24%).
These results suggest that the growth of genotype G2 is
less affected by water shortage compared to G1.

indicating that water was not a limiting factor for tree
growth. SWC was also higher in the area surrounding
genotype G2 than in genotype G1, except at two depths
(1 m and 4 m). This result suggests that the two genotypes absorb water preferentially from different depths,
possibly because their root system develops differently.
Effect of water deficit on biomass production

Genotype (p < 0.0001) and treatment (p < 0.001) had
significant effects on above-ground biomass production
(stem, dead branches, living branches and leaves) (Figure
4). Mean biomass was much higher for genotype G2
(12.8 kg) than for genotype G1 (8.6 kg) confirming earlier findings [48]. Not surprisingly, mean biomass was
higher for the IR treatment (11.8 kg) than for the NI
treatment (9.7 kg). A two-way ANOVA showed that the

We chose to sequence the shoot apex transcriptome to
study the molecular response of eucalyptus to water deficit, due to its role in shoot organogenesis [49]. Shoot
apices were pooled from three trees in four sets of conditions (2 genotypes × 2 treatments). Three half-runs
(A, B, C) of 454-Roche FLX Titanium sequencing provided 353,344 (run A), 405,223 (run B) and 380,099
(run C) reads, for a total of 1,138,666 sequences (398
Mb). The mean read length was 334 bp for run A, 369
bp for run B and 344 bp for run C (Table 1). Reads
were slightly shorter for run A, with a higher abundance
of reads comprised between 400-420 bp in length,
whereas runs B and C were characterised by reads of
460-480 bp in length (Additional file 2). To increase
contig length of the assembly, we combined all the
reads (1,138,666) generated in this study (E. spp sequencing set) with other GS-20 and GS-FLX 454 reads
(1,041,876 reads) from various organs of E. grandis (E.
grandis sequencing set; [13]). Figure 2 summarises the
various stages in sequence analysis, corresponding to
data quality control, read assembly, annotation and
abundance analysis. After removal of vector and adaptor
sequences, 1,994,741 reads were available for assembly.
Assembly with TGICL generated 231,715 unigene elements (UE) comprising 80,854 contigs and 150,861 singletons. Removal of low-quality sequences and
duplicated reads with the NG6 platform resulted in a
total of 202,279 UE (69,584 contigs and 132,690 singletons), from which 129,993 UE (49,748 contigs and
80,245 singletons) were identified in the E. spp sequencing set (this study) and used for digital gene expression
analysis (Table 2).
Contribution of the three half-run replicates

In total, 90,579 UE (70% of E. spp UE) did not have
sequence similarity to the E. grandis sequence reads
from Novaes et al. [13]. Most of these sequences were
singletons (71,761), although some were contigs
(18,818), corresponding to 27% of the E. spp contigs. A
BLAST homology search (cut-off: 10-10 ) of published
eucalyptus databases (ESTs from GenBank available on
April 2010; 454-ESTs generated by Novaes et al., [13];
454-ESTs from JGI from E. globulus xylem and leaf tissues; Illumina contigs generated by Mizrachi et al., [38])
showed that 21,401 UE (comprising 3,066 contigs and
18,335 singletons) did not match any known sequence.
Thus, the resource described here greatly extends the

list of genes known to be expressed in Eucalyptus,
which will be critical for the annotation of the genome
sequence. Due to the smaller number of reads in run A,
the total number of UE including reads generated from
run A was also smaller (58,763) than that generated
from the other two runs (67,467 in run B and 67,756 in
run C). Each supplementary half-run produced between
16 and 21% new contigs for a second half-run, and
between 5 and 7% for a third half-run (Additional file

3). Vega-Arreguin et al. [50] reported similar trends in
maize, with a plateau of gene representation reached
after the third successive GS-20 454-sequencing run.
The number of reads generated was therefore considered sufficient to sample most expressed genes.
The Pearson’s correlation coefficients (figure 5)
obtained for read frequencies in the 12 sequencing sets
from E. spp (87% on average) and the four sequencing
sets from E. grandis (86% on average) were similar.

However, the mean correlation was much weaker (52%)
between the E. spp and E. grandis sequencing sets, suggesting that different fractions of the transcriptome had
been sampled from these two studies and/or that gene
expression differed between both sequencing sets. As
expected, correlations were stronger between replicates
(92%; illustrated by squares in figure 5) than between
different samples (86%) in E. spp sequencing sets, suggesting a high level of technical repeatability.
Within conditions, correlations between the G1 and
G2 sequencing sets were robust and similar between
treatments: 90% for the IR treatment and 88% for the
NI treatment, suggesting that these two genotypes displayed similar patterns of gene expression when placed
in the same environmental conditions. Correlations
between the IR and NI sequencing sets were slightly
weaker and a stronger contrast was observed within
genotypes: on average, 86% for genotype G1 and 82%
for genotype G2. The weaker correlations obtained for
G2 suggest that this genotype had a more pronounced
response to water deficit than genotype G1.

BLAST search (e-value cut-off of 10e-5) results are summarised in Table 3. A functional annotation was obtained
more frequently for contigs - 70% of the contigs harboured similarity to sequences in protein databases, and
75% to sequences in nucleic acid databases. In contrast,
for singletons only 39% and 9% of the contigs had similarity to protein and nucleic acid sequences, respectively.
These differences were expected, given the longer mean
length of the contigs (734 bp) compared to singletons
(319 bp), their lower abundance and the fact that singletons are more likely to be sequencing artefacts. A larger
number of nucleic acid sequences had similarity to Arabidopsis (55% of annotated sequences), followed by Vitis
(25%), and Populus (6%). The greater similarity to Arabidopsis genes may be due to the closer phylogenetic relationship of Eucalyptus to Arabidopsis (both belong to the
eurosid II phylogenetic clade) than to Populus (eurosid I,
[51]). The Arabidopsis genome has also been annotated
in greater detailed than the Populus genome. Interestingly, the similar characteristics of eucalyptus and poplar
in terms of growth habits do not translated into higher
similarity of the sequences transcribed.
According to Gene Ontology (GO) classification, 38,190
UE (25% of the E.spp sequencing set UE) were associated
with at least one biological process (BP), molecular function
(MF) or cellular component (CC). The proportions of UE
annotated in each category were generally similar to those
obtained in Arabidopsis (Additional file 4), suggesting that
the E.spp sequencing sets are appropriate for the analysis of
gene expression on a broad range of functional categories.

remained for abundance analysis. Two statistical tests
were performed in series to detect differences in the
expression levels of these 14,460 contigs, among the
four experimental conditions (G1IR, G1NI, G2IR and
G2NI). First, a DEG-seq test [43] identified 1,651 differentially expressed contigs (FDR ≤ 5%). A two-way
ANOVA was then performed to assess the effects of the
two main factors (G and T) and their interaction (GxT)
on the number of reads per contig. This analysis identified 1,445 contigs with at least one significant effect (pvalue ≤ 5%; figure 6, additional file 5). With an error
rate of 5%, only 83 false positives are expected among
the 1,445 contigs.
Most of the differentially expressed contigs (1,280)
showed a genotype effect ("G contigs”), with 624 “G
contigs” overexpressed in genotype G1 (positive log2 transformed fold-change between contig abundance in
G1 vs. G2) vs. 656 “G contigs” underexpressed in G1 (
negative log2-transformed fold-change; figure 7A). Of
the 656 contigs overexpressed in genotype G2, 289
(44%) were expressed only in that genotype (with no
corresponding reads in the G1 sequencing sets) whereas
only 55 contigs (9%) showed the reverse trend, suggesting that G2 may express of a larger set of genes or different splicing variants.
A total of 155 contigs showing a treatment effect ("T
contigs"; figure 7B) were identified with similar numbers
overexpressed in the two treatments (81 in IR and 74 in
NI). Thirteen “T contigs” were expressed only in NI
conditions, whereas all the “T contigs” overexpressed in
IR conditions were also found in NI sequencing sets,

suggesting that few “specific genes” are upregulated in
response to water deficit but that the set of genes
expressed in favourable conditions is also expressed at a
lower level in stressed plants.
Finally, 274 contigs corresponded to “GxT” contigs.
The larger number of “GxT” contigs than of “T contigs”
suggests that some of the observed molecular plasticity
is under genetic control. Only 11 “GxT contigs” displayed significant differential expression between the IR
and NI conditions in genotype G1 (figure 7C), whereas
112 “GxT contigs” displayed such behaviour in genotype
G2 (figure 7D), suggesting a more pronounced response
in G2. Similarly, 48 “GxT contigs” were differentially
expressed between the two genotypes in IR conditions
(figure 7E), whereas 228 “GxT contigs” were differentially expressed between the two genotypes for the NI
treatment (figure 7F). These results suggest that, despite
the rather similar expression patterns for the two genotypes in IR conditions, water deficit induced a molecular
response specific to each genotype, reflecting different
strategies to respond to water shortage during the dry
season.
Blast2GO functional analysis

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed on 9,058
contigs (of 14,460 contigs containing more than 10
reads). These contigs were assigned to biological processes (BP), with 11 main subcategories (7,593 contigs),
cellular compartments (CC), with five main subcategories (7,347 contigs), and molecular functions (MF),
with eight main subcategories (7,638 contigs).

Consistent with the number of annotations per category
(BP, CC, MF), two subcategories were found to be
strongly represented: > 65% of the contigs were assigned
to cellular and metabolic processes for BP, more than
40% were assigned to cells and 85% to organelles for
CC, and > 40% were assigned to binding and catalytic
activity for MF. Figure 8 shows the distribution of contigs between these subcategories as a function of the
four classes of effects ("NS”, “G”, “T”, and “GxT” contigs). The homogeneity of the relative abundance of contigs between the “significant” classes ("G”, “T”, or
“GxT”) and the “not significant” class ("NS”) in each GO
category was assessed with Fisher’s exact tests. In BP,
“G” contigs were overrepresented in four subcategories

(response to stimulus, developmental process, death and
multiorganism process). “T” contigs were overrepresented in only one subcategory (response to stimulus).
Finally, “GxT” contigs were overrepresented in three
subcategories (response to stimulus, death and developmental process). These differences in relative abundance
suggest that genes related to defence reactions are the
main contributors to differences between significant and
“NS” contigs. For CC, only one subcategory (extracellular region) presented a higher relative abundance for all
three significant effects. For MF, “G” contigs were overrepresented in two subcategories (structural molecule
activity and molecular transducer activity), whereas “T”
contigs were overrepresented in only one subcategory

other subcategories (catalytic activity and antioxidant
activity) presented higher relative abundances than “NS”.
Analysis of metabolic pathways with MapMan

Of the 1,445 contigs displaying significant differential
expression, the 1,280 “G contigs” did not enable characterisation of specific molecular processes (i.e. did not
show any clear co-regulation with genes of the same
biosynthesis pathway). For 95% of these contigs, many
different genes from different molecular processes
were activated, depending on the experimental condition (Additional file 6). In some instances (5% of “G”
contigs), some bins presented specific overexpression
in one genotype (Additional file 7). For example, contigs related to ethylene biosynthesis and cell organisation were overexpressed mainly in genotype G2,
whereas contigs related to photosynthesis, nitrilases,
calcium signalling and pathogenesis-related protein
bins were overexpressed in genotype G1. Serine proteases (9 contigs) were expressed more strongly in genotype G1 (p-value = 0.038), whereas ubiquitin E3encoding proteins (23 contigs) were expressed more
strongly in genotype G2 (p-value = 0.096), suggesting

that proteolysis occurred via different pathways in the
two genotypes.
Analysis of the metabolic pathways for “T” contigs was
limited because of the small number of contigs (155),
which were distributed in several bins (Additional file
8). However, the expression of genes related to carbohydrate degradation and ethylene biosynthesis were found
to be stronger for the NI treatment, whereas the expression of genes related to ribosomal protein synthesis and
cell development appeared to be stronger for the IR
treatment (Additional file 7).
Different patterns were observed for “GxT” contigs
(figure 9): i) Some pathways (25% of “GxT” contigs) displayed similar patterns in the two genotypes, but with
responses of different magnitudes (i.e. scale plasticity, as
defined by Lynch and Walsh [52]). Photosystem components tended to be overrepresented in genotype G2 in
the IR condition, whereas few differences were observed
between conditions for genotype G1. Conversely, genes
related to cell organisation and PR-proteins were more
likely to be overexpressed in the NI condition in genotype G2 compared to genotype G1, ii) Interestingly,
most of the pathways (75% of “GxT"contigs) displayed
opposite trends in the two genotypes (i.e. a re-ranking

interaction effect [52]). For example, in the NI treatment, genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis,
auxin biosynthesis, heat stress, and light signalling were
overexpressed in genotype G1, while they where underexpressed in genotype G2. Conversely, genes related to
global primary metabolism (particularly starch degradation and ribosomal protein synthesis) and receptor
kinases were overexpressed in genotype G2, but underexpressed in genotype G1 in the NI condition (additional
file 7). This result strongly suggests that different metabolic pathways and genes were activated in these two
genotypes in response to water shortage. Thus, these two
genotypes exhibit different molecular strategies to cope
with water deficit during the dry season.

Discussion
Gene discovery and expression analysis by NGS

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are
becoming the method of choice for large-scale transcriptome analysis, even for non-model species (e.g. [29,41],
reviewed in [53]). Several technologies have been developed, differing essentially in the number of reads generated and read length (reviewed in [54]), making it
possible to catalogue the genes expressed and to monitor gene expression.
In Eucalyptus, Mizrachi et al. [38] generated 3.93 Gbp
of short reads (36-60 bp) with sequencing-by-synthesis
technology from Illumina, and assembled this

information de novo into 18,894 contigs (Illumina-contigs) longer than 200 bp (22.1 Mbp in total). In this
study, we obtained 0.398 Gbp of sequences with longer
reads (mean of 350 bp), which were assembled into
48,950 contigs (454-sequencing contigs) with more than
200 bp each (36.5 Mbp in total). We were thus able to
assemble more reads, i.e. 9.2% of the sequencing set,
that is a much higher rate than the 0.56% reported by
Mizrachi et al. [38]. BLAST searches for sequence similarities between the two datasets showed that 86% of the
contigs were common to both studies (42,550 454sequencing contigs matched 16,278 Illumina contigs).
However, each Illumina contig matched a mean of five
454-sequencing contigs, indicating that UE detected
with our approach were probably confounded in the
short-read assembly. In addition, the short Illumina contigs may represent domains shared by multiple proteins,
confirming the difficulty involved in assembling short
reads into transcriptional units [55]. Alternatively we
can not rule out the fact that genes were split in multiple contigs in the 454 assembly because of the lack of
coverage compared to Illumina’s short reads. Finally, we
found that 36,985 454-UE did not match any previously
described eucalyptus ESTs, and that 43% of these UE
(18% of the 454-sequencing contigs) displayed no match
with any nucleic acid or protein sequence published for
any other species. Therefore, our 454-sequencing data
considerably enriched the Eucalyptus EST collection.

RNA-Seq is also an interesting approach to obtain a
comprehensive digital gene expression profile for specific tissues, cell types or developmental processes. In this
study, the high degree of repeatability observed for the
three replicates made it possible to test G, T and GxT
effects with a statistical support. We were able to monitor the expression of 14,460 UE and to identify 1,445
UE displaying at least one significant effect. Some technical biases, such as non-linear amplification and a lack
of sequencing depth may have resulted in a lack of precision in the prediction of gene expression by 454sequencing (Additional file 9). Short read-based sequencing approaches provide ample read coverage and generally give better predictions of gene expression [56,57].
Thus, a combination of long and short reads may be
seen as a reasonable strategy for the analysis of gene
expression [55,58,59]. With this combined strategy,
long-read sequencing can be used to establish a comprehensive catalogue of transcriptional units, while short
reads mapped onto this assembly provide greater
sequencing depth, improving predictions of abundance.
Behaviour of variance components at the phenotypic and
molecular levels

We observed that phenotypic and molecular variation
are accounted for principally by genotypic differences.
Indeed, above-ground biomass and contig abundance
were influenced principally by genotype. Above-ground
biomass was, on average, 49% higher for G2 than for
G1, and most of the differentially expressed contigs
(1,280 of 1,455) in this study presented a genotypic
effect. The number of contigs overexpressed in one or
the other of the genotypes was similar - 624 and 656
contigs were overexpressed in G1 and G2, respectively.
No particular genotypic signature in terms of functional
categories or pathways was detected. The two genotypes
differed strongly in phenotype (not only it terms of
growth potential, but also in terms of leaf morphology,
stomatal distribution and water use efficiency), but it
remains unclear whether these differences in transcript
abundance were responsible for trait variation, neutral,
or simply involved in reproductive isolation between
parental species. Indeed, differences in gene expression
between species have been reported in the field of ecological genomics [60,61] and interpreted as a mechanism
of speciation. In our study, both genotypes were hybrid
combinations between different species. This may have
increased the number of differences between their transcriptomes. Further investigations about the role of gene
expression in ecological speciation is an important question, particularly for eucalyptus, in which species complexes are common [62].
The variance accounted for by genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) at the phenotypic and molecular

Page 13 of 18

level was also significant in this study. The NI treatment
resulted in a significantly lower above-ground biomass,
and this difference was greater for the least productive
of the two genotypes, G1 (24%), than for G2 (12%). The
G and T effects accounted for 56% and 13% of the
above-ground biomass variation, respectively, whereas
GxT effects accounted for only 0.2% of the variance. At
the molecular level, we also found a higher proportion
of genes displaying G effects (1,280 contigs, 8.8% of the
contigs screened) but, surprisingly, we found fewer
genes displaying T effects (155 contigs, 1.1% of the contigs screened) than GxT effects (274 contigs, 1.9% of the
contigs screened).
While only 11 contigs were differentially expressed
between the two treatments in genotype G1, 112 contigs
showed differential expression in genotype G2 (4 contigs
displayed differential expression for both genotypes).
Moreover, when the whole E. spp sequencing set was
screened, genotype G2 presented a larger number of
specific contigs (10.5% of the E.spp sequencing set) than
G1 (5.5% of the E.spp sequencing set). These results
suggest that a larger set of genes is activated in genotype
G2, leading to the triggering of specific responses to
water deficit. This higher molecular sensitivity of genotype G2 may confer advantages ultimately resulting in a
greater capacity to cope with water deficit during the
dry season and, therefore, in stronger growth capacity
(table 4).
Genes displaying GEI effects reflect differences in signal
perception and response strategy

Contigs displaying GEI effects could be classified into
two groups according to the function of the proteins
encoded [63]: i) regulatory proteins responsible for
drought signal transduction and response triggering, and
ii) functional proteins involved in cell protection,
damage repair and the maintenance of cell activity.
Regarding regulatory functions, the genes involved in
the biosynthesis of hormones, such as ethylene and auxins in particular (aldo/keto reductase, proteins of the
ethylene-responsive family, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
dioxygenase) were mostly overexpressed in genotype G1
and underexpressed in G2, in the NI condition. Genes
acting as second messengers in the transduction of hormonal signal to stomatal guard cells [64,65] also displayed GEI effects: in the NI condition, genes involved
in calcium signalling were predominantly overexpressed
in G1, whereas the response of G2 to drought preferentially involved receptor kinases. We also identified other
signal transducers, such as light-induced proteins and
heat-shock proteins, which may be related to other
types of stress induced by water deficit, including osmotic stress due to pH variations and oxidative stress due
to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)

[66,67]. These pathways were mostly overexpressed in
G1 and underexpressed in G2 during the dry season.
Pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes were overexpressed in G2, but displayed a less clear-cut pattern of
expression in G1. PR proteins were initially reported to
be induced by hormones or ROS in response to biotic
stress [68,69], but they have also been shown to be
involved in other abiotic stresses [70]. Lee et al. [69]
also suggested that PR proteins may be used as storage
proteins when growth is limited by environmental factors. Some transcription factors responded strongly to
water shortage in genotype G2. Two, in particular,
encoded factors homologous to AtMYB12 and
AtMYB85, which have been shown to regulate secondary metabolism (flavonoid and lignin biosynthesis,
respectively) in Arabidopsis [71]. These results suggest
that water shortage induces different cellular stress cascades, perceived differently by the two genotypes.
Stress signal transducers interact to trigger the regulation of gene expression for the maintenance of three
main functions: cell protection, damage repair and the
maintenance of cell activity. Our results suggest that
more genes related to cell protection were involved in
the response to water shortage in genotype G1 than in
genotype G2. Protection against drought stress seems to
involve mostly carbohydrates, with 11 contigs displaying
GEI effects, and, to a lesser extent, polyamines, which
may modulate some ion channels [72].
By contrast to the trends observed for genes related
to cell protection, more genes related to damage repair
seem to be expressed during the dry season in genotype G2 than in genotype G1, particularly those related
to cell organisation. The overexpression, during NI
treatment, of genes related to primary metabolism,
including carbohydrate, lipid and protein synthesis and

degradation, suggests that resources are reallocated for
the repair of cell structures or the formation of new
structures in drought stressed plants. The patterns of
expression of secondary metabolism genes differed
between the two genotypes as well. As an example, G1
displayed a higher number of genes related to terpenoids and flavonoids synthesis (that may protect
against oxidative stress) overexpressed in the NI treatment compared to genotype G2. However, the contrasts between NIR and IR treatments were much
higher for G2. Conversely, genes related to lignin biosynthesis (e.g. CCoAOMT) were overexpressed in the
IR condition only for G2.
Gene related to photosynthesis were found to be
under-expressed in G2 subjected to NI treatment,
whereas no variation was found in G1. Other metabolic
processes, such cell development and transport, controlled by genes encoding water or sugar channels,
decreased in NI treatment, particularly in G2. These
results confirm the trends observed by Alexandersson et
al. [73] in Arabidopsis. These authors studied the expression of 18 genes encoding aquaporins and showed that
most of these genes were downregulated in leaves subjected to a gradual water deficit. Interestingly, cell activity
seemed to be more reduced at the transcriptional level
for G2, although this genotype grew more strongly. It is
possible that, during water deficit, genotype G2 reduces
its rate of photosynthesis and reallocates resources (as
suggested by changes in primary metabolism) to preserve
its cell structures and ability to resume growth when conditions become more favourable.
Evolutionary implication behind GEI

We found that 31 of the 274 contigs displaying a GxT
effect were absent from the G1 sequencing set (11.3%),

Villar et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:538
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/538

whereas only two such contigs were absent in G2 (0.7%).
Unfortunately, of 31 contigs absent in G1, 16 could not
been assigned to a homolog gene in Arabidopsis. The
others corresponded to genes related to cell organisation
(ankyrins), ethylene synthesis, protein metabolism, PR
proteins and receptor kinases. These genes may be considered non-essential for tree development, and are
therefore unlikely to be subject to selection constraints.
Landry et al. [74] found an overrepresentation of nonessential genes (the deletion of which is not lethal)
among genes displaying GEI in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They proposed two hypotheses to account for the
activity of these genes being compensated in cells: i)
metabolic buffering: non-coded metabolites may be
rerouted through the metabolic network, and ii) genetic
buffering: paralogous genes may supply the missing
function. We showed in the results section (Additional
file 5) that differences between genotypes may be
accounted for by the preferential expression of different
members or splicing forms of genes from the same
family. This observation may confirm the hypothesis of
genetic buffering.
Scale plasticity was observed for 146 of the 274 differentially expressed contigs: genotype ranks were conserved between treatments but one genotype reacted
more or less strongly to the environmental variation.
Conversely, 90 contigs showed a change in ranking
between genotypes (rank plasticity). Landry et al. [74]
hypothesised that these two types of GEI would have
different effects on the evolution of plastic traits. In the
case of scale plasticity, whatever the environment, selection would result in the same favoured genotype,
whereas in the case of rank plasticity, different genotypes would be selected in different environments. In
the present study, we found differentially expressed
genes presenting both scale plasticity (62%) and rank
plasticity (38%), indicating different types of reaction
norms on which natural selection would act on.

Conclusions
We showed that next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool for transcriptome screening: with 398 Mb of
sequence, we were able to assemble ESTs into 69,584
contigs, with remaining 80,245 singletons, and to determine the relative abundance of 14,460 contigs each
comprising more than 10 reads. Large differences
between genotypes, in terms of phenotypic behaviour
and transcriptome regulation, were observable. Differences in gene expression between the two genotypes
appear to affect the whole transcriptome, rather than
specific pathways. The genotype-specific response to
water shortage (i.e. GxT effect) was more pronounced
than the response common to both genotypes (i.e. T
effect). The genes displaying genetically controlled

Page 15 of 18

plasticity were found to belong to a number of different
pathways essentially related to signal transduction and
primary metabolism. The more productive genotype,
G2, express a larger set of genes, leading to the triggering of specific molecular responses. Moreover, GxT
interaction results principally from a lack of molecular
response in genotype G1, together with a strong
response of genotype G2 (table 4). The ability to regulate more actively its transcriptome might be a key component in the maintenance of biomass in water deficit
conditions.
Finally, although this study provides clues to the way
in which different genotypes activate their transcriptomes when subjected to water deficit, more research is
required to understand the molecular mechanisms
involved during the dry season. First, there is a need to
characterize reaction norm in a broader genetic background [75]. Second, epigenetics or post-transcriptional
regulation mechanisms that are well known to interfere
with abiotic stress responses [76,77] deserve specific
investigations.
