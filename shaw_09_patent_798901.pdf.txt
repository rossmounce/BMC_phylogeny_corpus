Abstract
Herbal medicines are used in many countries for maintaining health and treating diseases. Their
efficacy depends on the use of the correct materials, and life-threatening poisoning may occur if
toxic adulterants or substitutes are administered instead. Identification of a medicinal material at
the DNA level provides an objective and powerful tool for quality control. Extraction of highquality DNA is the first crucial step in DNA authentication, followed by a battery of DNA
techniques including whole genome fingerprinting, DNA sequencing and DNA microarray to
establish the identity of the material. New or improved technologies have been developed and
valuable data have been collected and compiled for DNA authentication. Some of these
technologies and data are patentable. This article provides an overview of some recent patents that
cover the extraction of DNA from medicinal materials, the amplification of DNA using improved
reaction conditions, the generation of DNA sequences and fingerprints, and the development of
high-throughput authentication methods. It also briefly explains why these patents have been
granted.

Background
Herbal medicines are used in many countries; unlike
chemical drugs, herbal preparations often consist of a
combination of materials. Life-threatening poisoning
may occur if toxic adulterants or substitutes are used
instead. In 1989, two individuals in Hong Kong suffered
serious neuropathy and encephalopathy after consuming
a broth made with the roots of Podophyllum hexandrum
(Taoerqi), a toxic herb mistaken as Gentiana rigescens
(Dianlongdan) [1]. In 2001, 63 people in the Netherlands
reported symptoms of general malaise, nausea, and vom-

iting 2 to 4 hours following consumption of an herbal tea
containing Illicium anisatum (Japanese star anise) [2]. Aristolochic acid nephropathy has also been reported in Hong
Kong [3], Korea [4], and Belgium [5] as a result of herbs
contaminated with aristolochic acids.
Herbal medicinal products of high quality are essential for
consumer confidence. Many countries and regions have
set up quality standard tests for imported herbal medicine. For example, 324 Chinese medicinal materials are
regulated by the Department of Health in Taiwan [6].

Herbal manufacturers must label their product with the
names of the herbs in the product, and products without
such labels are prohibited from entering Taiwan.
Herbal medicinal materials are traditionally identified by
their organoleptic or microscopic characteristics, including size, shape, color, odor, flavor, texture and other physical properties. Although the methods based on these
characteristics are simple, their accuracy strongly depends
on the experience of the inspector, who may or may not
be aware of the subtle differences in the structures among
related species. Chemical analysis is powerful but the
results are affected by the physiological and storage conditions of the herbs. Closely related species containing similar chemical components may also confuse the
identification.
DNA technology provides a useful and independent tool
to complement chemical analyses for the authentication
and quality assurance of medicinal materials. DNA technology offers four advantages: (1) DNA-based markers are
less affected by age and physiological conditions; (2) any
part of the herb can be collected for analysis; (3) only a
small sample is necessary for analysis; and (4) some DNA
regions may be species-specific, whereas others may be
family-specific.
The principles and techniques of DNA methods were
recently reviewed [7,8]. Therefore, only a brief account of
the popular techniques for DNA authentication is given as
an introduction.
A major approach in DNA authentication is wholegenome fingerprinting. The common methods include
random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [9], simple
sequence repeat (SSR) [10], amplified fragment length
polymorphism (AFLP) [11], and direct amplification of
length polymorphism (DALP) [12]. These methods do
not require any prior knowledge of the target DNA
sequence and, in general, allow for quick identification of
genetic polymorphism [13-16].
Owing to the processing procedures, DNA of herbal material is usually somewhat degraded. For accurate DNA fingerprints, attention must be paid to certain defined
regions of the genome. Approaches available include
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) [17-19] and sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR). The latter involves first
sequencing the polymorphic bands from the wholegenome fingerprinting and then using them as reference
markers. Multiplex PCR may be employed to examine several SCAR markers simultaneously [20,21].

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/4/1/21

DNA sequencing is the most definitive means for revealing the identity of an unknown sample [22]. For highthroughput authentication, DNA microarrays may be
used. The steps include designing specific probes for a species, fabricating them onto a support, hybridizing with
fluorescent-labeled fragments amplified from the
genomic DNA of the herbal mixture and reading the
hybridization signals with a scanner. A DNA microarray
has been established for the identification of a Dendrobium species from a medicinal formula containing nine
herbal components [23] and for the differentiation of
Dendrobium officinale from other Dendrobium species [24].
In this article, we first outline the procedures of patent
application for readers who are not familiar with the process. Then, we describe the existing patents for using DNA
methods to authenticate medicinal materials and illustrate how they overcome the limitations of the existing
technologies. We also evaluate their market potential and
suggest ways to improve them. We hope readers will
appreciate how existing DNA technologies may be
applied in novel ways for the authentication of medicinal
materials as well as opportunities for patent application.
Patents and the application process
For a United States (US) patent to be issued, an invention
must be novel, non-obvious, and useful [25]. Section 101
of Title 35 of the US Codes (35 USC §101) states that "
[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or
any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a
patent therefore, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title." Furthermore, " [a] patent may not be
obtained though the invention that is not identically disclosed or described ..., if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such
that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having
ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains" (35 USC §103). The patentee is granted the right to
exclude others from making, using, offering to sell or
importing the invention into the US for a period of 20
years from the date of filing the patent application. There
are three types of patents in the US, namely utility, design,
and plant patents. Patents for biotechnology are mostly
utility patents.

The process starts with filing an application with the US
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) (Figure 1). The
application should include a written description (also
known as specification) of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it in full, clear, concise and exact terms to enable a person skilled in the art to
make and use the invention. In addition, the application
must describe the best mode considered by the inventor

of carrying out the invention. The application should also
include at least one claim setting forth the metes and
bounds of the subject matter to be protected. The Office of
Initial Patent Examination of the USPTO reviews the
application to see if all initial requirements have been
met. The application is then assigned a serial number, and
an examiner from the relevant art unit of the USPTO is
assigned to assess the application [26]. The examiner will
assess the claims on their merits. If objections or rejections to some or all of the claims are raised, the applicant
will be given an opportunity to amend the claims and/or
refute the objections or rejections, until the examiner is
convinced that the claims are allowable. After receiving a
notice of allowance and paying an issue fee, the applicant
will receive a patent on the invention as defined by the
allowed claims.
A Chinese patent may be obtained by applying to the State
Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of the People's Repub-

lic of China [27]. Unlike in the US where the first person
who invents is honored, in China's system the first person
who invents and files an application for a patent is entitled to a patent. In the US, an inventor has one year from
the date of the first public disclosure of an invention to
file an application for patent protection, whereas China
does not usually allow such a grace period. Apart from
these differences, the US and China have similar criteria
for patentability regarding what is known as a utility patent. The Chinese Guidelines for Examination issued in
2006 by the SIPO uses the term "inventive step" instead of
"non-obviousness" for judging the patentability. In Article 22.3 of the guidelines, " [i]nventive step of invention
means that, as compared with the existing technology
before the date of filing, the invention has prominent substantive features and represents notable progress." An
invention is said to have prominent substantive features
if, "having regard to the prior art, it is non-obvious to a
person skilled in the art" (Guidelines for Examination). In

Chinese Medicine 2009, 4:21

other words, " [i]f the person skilled in the art can obtain
the invention just by logical analysis, inference or limited
experimentation on the basis of the prior art, the invention is obvious and therefore has no prominent substantive features" (Guidelines for Examination).
A utility patent in the US is equivalent to an invention patent in China. However, like many other countries, China
has what are known as utility model patents, which are
reserved for "any new technical solution relating to the
shape, the structure, or their combination, of a product,
which is fit for practical use" (Guidelines for Examination). Although a utility model patent is usually issued
much faster than an invention patent because of the less
stringent examination process, protection from a utility
model patent is only good for 10 years as compared to 20
years for an invention patent. The inventions described
later in this article probably cannot be protected by a utility model patent except for the matrix mill under US Patent 6063616.
To obtain patent protection in multiple countries, inventors may file an international application under the Patent
Cooperation Treaty. The United States and China are
among the approximately 139 contracting countries of the
treaty. After filing an international application, the applicant has a period of typically 30 to 31 months following
the priority date (usually the filing date of a prior application that the international application claims priority of)
to file national stage applications in any of the contracting
countries. An international search report and written
opinion are normally issued by an international searching
authority for the international application prior to the
timeline to enter a national stage. These reports cite any
prior art and give an initial evaluation on patentability of
the claims, so the applicant would have an opportunity to
determine if and where he or she wants to seek protection
of the invention. If applications are then submitted to
individual countries, they will be examined based on the
international written opinion and according to local patent laws and rules. Any patent later issued will be enforceable only within the country of issue.

as examples for explaining why some of these patents
have been allowed (Additional file 1) while other applications were abandoned (Additional file 2) so that the readers can appreciate the criteria.
Patents for extraction of nucleic acids
The first step in DNA extraction is to grind or cut the sample into small pieces. Traditionally, this has been achieved
by methods that use chemical, sonic wave, mechanical, or
physical pressure systems. Sometimes hazardous liquid
nitrogen or mortar and pestle are used. As such, these
methods are often expensive, require too much effort for
large-scale extractions, and provide low throughput. To
accelerate and simplify the extraction process, Weeden et
al. invented an innovative matrix mill (US Patent
6063616) that can isolate genomic DNA from numerous
samples simultaneously [28]. Samples are added into a
96-well plate and a micropestle composed of a ferrous
core coated with a non-reactive material being inserted
into each tube (Figure 2). The plate is then placed onto the
matrix mill, which provides electromagnetic energy for
the movement of the pestle inside the tubes and acts as the
random motion of a manual mortar and pestle. Studies
showed that this matrix mill gave excellent DNA extracts
for tissue types including pea, bean, cucumber, pepper
and broccoli. Up to 96 samples can be prepared in each
run, and the quality of DNA is sufficient for PCR. The
authors believe that adding a chilling device to the matrix

Since the 1990s, DNA techniques have become popular
for the authentication and quality control of Chinese
medicinal material. For the protection of intellectual
properties and opportunities for commercialization, patents have been applied for the extraction of DNA from
medicinal material, amplification of DNA from difficult
templates, generation of species-specific fingerprints and
sequences, and high-throughput detection and identification of unknown DNA. In this article, recent US and Chinese patents relating to the extraction and amplification
of DNA and the generation of DNA fingerprints and
sequences for Chinese medicinal materials are described

is first added into the well (1) of the assay plate (2). The assay
plate is then placed into the matrix mill with upper and lower
magnetic core and coil assemblies (3, 4) in proximity. The
grinding rod (5) is inserted into the well (1). Once alternating
current passes through the upper coil assemblies (3, 4) in the
frames (6, 7), the magnetically active grinding rod (5) begins
the maceration of the sample material within the well.

mill would be beneficial because the sample can then be
processed under low temperature to avoid the degradation of DNA and RNA samples. Reducing the size of the
micropestle would expand the capacity of the mill to a
384-plate format.
DNA with a high molecular weight that is free from contaminants ensures the success of molecular authentication. Generally, lysis buffer for DNA extraction comprises
buffering ions, surfactants, chelators and proteinase. Chelators such as EDTA can bind to the free divalent ions to
inhibit the enzymatic activities of some nucleases. Proteinase K digests the tissue or cell membrane and increases
the yield of extraction. However, this Ca2+-dependent
enzyme may not have a significant effect because divalent
ions in the buffer are tightly bound to the chelators. US
Patent 7214484 was issued for a lysis buffer that does not
require a high concentration of chelators, allowing proteinase K to effectively digest the protein molecules in a sample and resulting in an increase in the efficiency of cell
lysis [29]. This method is more effective in extracting DNA
from animal than herbal material, as the former has
higher protein content than the latter. To improve the
lysis buffer for DNA extraction, we propose modifying
proteinase K to make it less ion-dependent or replacing
proteinase K altogether with a proteinase that is ion-independent.
For DNA isolation, organic solvents such as phenol and
chloroform are commonly used. After centrifugation,
DNA stays in the upper aqueous phase, whereas protein
contaminants are denatured and partitioned either with
the organic phase or at the interface between the organic
and aqueous phases. The aqueous phase containing DNA
molecules is then aspirated. However, the aspirated aqueous phase is sometimes contaminated with organic solvent because the aqueous-organic interface is not very
stable. Non-polar phenolic compounds of the herbal
material may inhibit downstream reactions, such as PCR.
US Patent 5106966 was issued for an innovative DNA
extraction method using polyester silica gel in the extraction medium [30]. Before centrifugation, polyester silica
gel is placed in the bottom of the tube. This gel moves and
separates the aqueous phase from the organic phase after
centrifugation, acting as a barrier to permit decanting of
the aqueous solvent. This method produces 40% more
DNA than the one without polyester silica gel. Moreover,
the ratio of absorbance at 260-280 nm of the purified
DNA is consistently 1.8, which means the purified preparation is free from protein contamination.
Patents for the amplification of difficult templates
After extracting the genomic DNA of the medicinal material, the next step is to employ PCR to generate a DNA fingerprint or obtain a particular region for further study.

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/4/1/21

PCR is an enzymatic reaction that can amplify a defined
region of the template DNA from a tiny amount of source
material. It has become an indispensable technique used
in biological research and has broad applications in DNA
cloning, DNA sequencing, molecular phylogenetics, and
molecular diagnosis. The PCR patent was granted to Cetus
Corporation in 1987 [31] and later sold to Roche Molecular Systems. Since the invention in 1984, many related
patented techniques have been developed, such as directional cloning for inserting a gene in a correct frame [32],
multiplex PCR for amplifying multiple regions of
genomic DNA [33], reverse transcription PCR for amplifying a defined piece of RNA [34], and hot-start PCR for
increasing the specificity of the reaction [35]. Some of
these patented techniques have been adopted for the
amplification and cloning of DNA from medicinal material.
PCR may produce a negative result due to the presence of
inhibitors or the secondary structure of the template or
primer. The secondary structure of primers reduces the
efficiency or even inhibits the binding process. High GC
content of the DNA template in some medicinal materials
also increases the melting temperature and makes the
amplification process difficult. Some researchers tried to
solve the problem by increasing the denaturation temperature from the conventional 94°C to 98°C or extending
the denaturation time. Nevertheless, DNA polymerase
may lose its activity under prolonged elevated temperature conditions. As such, the reaction buffer must be modified to protect DNA polymerase from degradation. US
Patent 7150980 was issued for the use of proline, 2methyl-4-carboxy-5-hydroxy-3,4,5,6,-tetrahydropyrimidine THP(A) and 2-methyl-4-carboxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine THP(B) to increase the thermal stability of
DNA polymerases at high temperatures [36], whereas
THP(B) can lower the melting temperature of doublestranded DNA. US Patent 6783940 was issued for a technique that further improves the PCR condition by including sorbitol or sorbitol and DMSO in the PCR mixture,
which is effective for reducing the non-specific amplification [37]. Sorbitol at a concentration of 0.15 M results in
an increase in specific target DNA.
Hot-start PCR can increase the reaction specificity by
inhibiting the activity of DNA polymerase during the sample preparation step. In hot-start PCR, DNA polymerase is
bound to an antibody that is inactivated and dissociated
from the DNA polymerase by heat denaturation. The
major drawback is that the anti-polymerase antibody is
expensive and only specific to a particular polymerase. US
Patent 6403341 was issued for a method of inactivating
the DNA polymerase by keeping the concentration of
magnesium ions low [38], and this method is as efficient
as hot-start PCR. The magnesium ions added in the reac-

tion mixture are in precipitate form. Without magnesium
ions, the DNA polymerase is inactive and no non-specific
reaction occurs. Upon raising the temperature, magnesium ions are released from the precipitate. Magnesium
ions are mixed with various phosphates in a tube to form
precipitate. After precipitation, PCR components are
added into the tube and PCR is then performed. In our
view, this method may not be easy to reproduce as it is difficult to aliquot the precipitate accurately into individual
tubes. Researchers should find a form of sequestered magnesium ions that can be stored and aliquoted as a solution. Upon heating, the sequestered ions are then released
and the PCR reaction takes place.
The amplification success rate of PCR can be further
increased by finding a superior polymerase or a better formulated PCR buffer. Such improvements would enhance
the DNA amplification processes and may decrease the
amount of template required. The latter is relevant to the
amplification of DNA from medicinal materials, as in
many cases the DNA of processed material is difficult to
extract or highly degraded. Also, DNA extracted from
dried medicinal materials may be contaminated with phytochemicals that can inhibit the amplification process.
Improvements in the PCR buffer and DNA polymerase
may overcome such inhibition and increase the amplification success rate.
Patents for the generation of species-specific fingerprints
and sequences
Commercial ginseng products come in the form of powder or shredded slices, rendering authentication by morphological and histological methods unpractical.
Chemical analysis is limited by the available amount of
chemical markers, ginsenosides, which are significantly

affected by such factors as storage conditions, freshness of
products, and post-harvesting processing. The techniques
described in this section are patentable because they are
improved technologies that can solve the authentication
difficulties.
US Patent 5876977 was issued for a method of fingerprinting ginseng by taking advantage of the unique PCRRFLP patterns of different ginsengs [39]. The form or the
physical and chemical conditions of the sample do not
appear to affect the outcome of the method. The internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA of herbal
material is highly polymorphic between different species
and is amplified by primers that bind to the conserved
regions. The PCR products are then fragmented by
selected restriction endonuclease. After electrophoresis,
discrete and species-specific RFLP patterns are generated.
The ITS sequences of several medicinal species, including
Panax ginseng (Renshen), Panax quinquefolius (Xiyangshen),
and Codonopsis (Dangshen) species, have been patented.
More than one distinctive RFLP profiles can be generated
by digesting these DNAs with different restriction
enzymes, which makes the interpretation of results
straightforward. Chinese Patent 01102434 employs the
same approach to authenticate other herbal materials
[40]. The ITS sequences of 16 medicinal Dendrobium species and adulterant Pholidota cantonensi may also be beneficial to the horticulture industry. Patents for
authenticating high-value Chinese medicinal materials
are summarized in Table 1.
Besides the ITS region, 5S rRNA intergenic spacer (5S
rRNA) has also been employed to authenticate medicinal
material. US Patent 6569625 was issued for a method of
differentiating four medicinal Fritillaria species using this

DNA region [41]. 5S rRNA is amplified by PCR and then
sequenced. Each Fritillaria species has a unique spacer
sequence, with the highest similarity between Fritillaria
anhuiensis and Fritillaria puqiensis (97.48%). After digestion with EcoRI, fragments of 384 bp and 314 bp from Fritillaria cirrhosa and 460 bp and 123 bp from Fritillaria
thunbergii are obtained, while the PCR products of Fritillaria anhuiensis and Fritillaria puqiensis are not cleaved.
When using PCR-RFLP for rapid screening of species, the
amplified region should be chosen carefully. For example,
5S rRNA intergenic spacer is a highly variable region, but
there are many point mutations, insertions, and deletions
among different copies of the gene in some species. As a
result, the restriction profiles may not be consistent. We
think that looking at the ITS or chloroplast regions of Fritillaria species may be more beneficial.
PCR-RFLP has also been used to authenticate drugs from
animal sources such as the skin of donkey (Equus asinus
L.), which is the raw material for the production of Ejiao
used for treating anemia with dizziness, palpitation, muscular weakness; excessive menstrual discharge and tremors due to blood deficiency [42]. It is difficult to
distinguish between Ejiao made from donkey and that
from cow or horse because protein compositions from
these animals are similar; therefore, using mass spectrometry or enzymatic analysis would not be helpful. Chinese
Patent 03153838 was issued for a method of distinguishing Equus asinus from other domestic animals by amplifying partial cytochrome b gene regions (about 359 bp)
from the skin of donkey, horse, cow, and mule [43]. PCRRFLP profiles are generated by digestion of DNA with
HinfI, HaeIII, AluI, MboI, TaqI, and MseI. The resolution of
this method could be increased if the DNA sequences of
these animals were determined in order to provide more
information.
Another group has designed a testing kit for distinguishing Eriocheir japonica sinensis (hairy crabs) from Eriocheir
japonica hepuensis. Hairy crab is popular with the medicinal value of removing heat from the stomach and liver
and healing bone fractures [44]. Chinese Patent
01127215 was issued for a testing kit with a pair of specific primers and DraI restriction enzyme [45]. A 293-bp
DNA fragment is amplified with the specific primers and
then digested with DraI. For Eriocheir japonica hepuensis,
the DNA is cleaved at position 188 and two fragments are
generated. There is no DraI site in the corresponding DNA
of Eriocheir japonica sinensis, and therefore its DNA
remains intact after digestion.
Cordyceps is a composite consisting of the stroma of the
fungus Cordyceps sinensis, which parasitizes on the caterpillars of some moth. It is used to tonify the lung and kidney, arrest bleeding, and dissolve phlegm. Despite the

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/4/1/21

many adulterants in the herbal market, prior classification
methods based on configuration, physiology, or biochemistry could not provide an accurate and reliable classification of Cordyceps sinensis. Chinese Patent 99106135
and US Patent 6271003 were issued for a novel method
for distinguishing Cordyceps sinensis from seven closely
related fungal species [46,47]. The 18S rRNA region of
genomic DNA is amplified and the PCR products are
digested separately with four restriction enzymes. Based
on the generated fingerprints, CfoI produces restriction
fragments of 570, 300, and 50 bp in C. sinensis. Phytocordyceps ninchukispora also has three fragments, but the
sizes are different (830, 320, and 150 bp). Five fragments
are produced in Cordyceps militaris, and the PCR products
of five other fungal species are not cleaved. The 18S rRNA
gene was then sequenced and compared in US Patent
6251606 [48]. All Cordyceps sinensis specimens have the
same 18S rRNA gene sequence, which distinguishes them
from related species. As compared with PCR-RFLP, DNA
sequencing provides more information down to the base
level while PCR-RFLP is much faster and is more suitable
for screening. While the technology gives clear PCR-RFLP
fingerprints for the fungi, it may not be easy to apply to
Cordyceps, because both the 18S rRNA sequence of Cordyceps sinensis and the moth are amplified, and the resulting
PCR-RFLP pattern may be confusing. For improvement, it
may be necessary to design fungal-specific primers so that
only the fungal DNA is amplified. In addition, because the
18S rRNA gene is rather conserved, possibly leading to
inadequate resolution, other highly variable regions, such
as an ITS, should be considered.
Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is another
simple and fast DNA technique for generating fingerprints
for medicinal materials. To identify an unknown sample,
DNA from a known species is used as a standard control.
After electrophoresis, the identity of the sample can be
determined by matching it to the profile of a reference
sample. However, RAPD fingerprints may be affected by
the purity and integrity of the DNA template, type of DNA
polymerase, and thermocycler used. On the other hand,
polymorphic bands generated from RAPD are a good
starting point for performing SCAR (Figure 3). US Patent
6803215 was issued for the use of SCAR to differentiate
plant and animal medicinal materials, including Panax
and medicinal snakes [49]. SCAR requires only one PCR
step; thus, SCAR is more efficient than the PCR-RFLP
approach described in US Patent 5876977 [39]. Polymorphic regions of ginseng were first identified by RAPD or
direct amplification of length polymorphism (DALP),
and several sets of SCAR primers were then designed to
distinguish Panax ginseng and Panax quinquefolius and
their adulterants. For animal samples, polymorphic bands
that distinguished between the snake species Agkistrodon
actus, Bungarus multicinctus, and Zaocys dhumandes were

SCAR primers can be designed from a whole-genome fingerprint, such as RAPD analysis or comparison of the DNA sequences

among species
SCAR primers can be designed from a whole-genome fingerprint, such as RAPD analysis or comparison of the
DNA sequences among species. During RAPD, genomic DNA is amplified by a RAPD primer. A polymorphic band is
recovered from agarose gel and then sequenced. The RAPD band is turned into a species-specific SCAR marker.

first produced by RAPD. These bands were sequenced for
the design of SCAR primers, which are species-specific.
The primers do not amplify DNA of other snake species or
common domestic animals.
Chinese Patent 200410016240 was issued for a technique
that differentiates wild ginseng from cultivated ginseng
and adulterants. Two set of primers were designed based

on the polymorphic DNA generated by DALP [50]. The
first primer set only amplifies the genomic DNA of cultivated ginseng and produces a 174-bp PCR product. The
second primer set can detect wild and cultivated ginseng
and produces a 300-bp PCR product. These four primers
can be used in multiplex PCR, which greatly increases the
efficiency of the test.

SCAR primers can also be designed from an internal polymorphic site of the DNA (Figure 3). Chinese Patent
00134133 was issued for a process of generating SCAR
primers using this approach [51]. Radix et Rhizoma Rhei
(Dahuang) is the dried root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum, R. tanguticum, or R. officinale. Its indications include
fever with constipation, retention of feces, abdominal
pain, and jaundice caused by damp-heat. Chloroplast
intergenic spacer trnL-F of three genuine species and 10
closely related Rheum species were amplified by PCR
amplified, and the PCR products were sequenced and
aligned. At position 221, the nucleotide for the three genuine species is cytosine while that of the other Rheum species is adenine. A pair of specific primers was designed
based on this polymorphic site. The three genuine species
produce a single 300-bp band after SCAR and the other
species give a negative result. Similarly, Chinese Patent
200510031346 was issued for a SCAR sequence for differentiating between Gastrodia eleata (Tianma) and its adulterant Lycopus lucidus (Zelan) [52]. With increasing DNA
sequences available in the public sequence databases, we
have a convenient resource for primer design.

particular Ilex species is hybridized to the DNA of its own
species, a stronger signal is obtained.
Development after patent application
Patentable advancements have been made in DNA
authentication, ranging from the extraction of DNA to
high-throughput detection. In particular, inventions that
improve the existing protocols for DNA extraction and
PCR would have high market value because they can be
easily incorporated into existing products. In addition,
patented DNA sequences may be employed for designing
primers in testing kits or DNA microarrays. Substantial
investment will be needed for generating new types of
equipment, such as a new DNA extractor. In this case, a
patent or a patent application would be especially valuable in terms of securing financial support for developing
the technology. After applying for a patent, the inventor
would begin to seek for support to further develop the
invention. Nevertheless, the application may sometimes
be abandoned [54-58], if it is found to have little commercial interest.

Conclusion
In general, it takes time to identify species-specific SCAR
markers, but once found and specific primers designed,
authentication of unknown samples becomes simple and
routine. SCAR products are specific, as stringent conditions are used when amplifying the DNA. To further
improve the resolution and sensitivity of SCAR and DALP,
it is important to determine and use highly variable DNA
regions and fluorescent primers.
Patents for high-throughput detection and identification
of unknown DNA
DNA identification by PCR-RFLP relies on the presence of
restriction cutting sites in the amplified DNA sequence. In
the absence of an expected cutting site, which may result
from a sequence polymorphism, authentication of a specimen is not possible. Use of DNA hybridization may yield
results that are difficult to interpret because hybridization
signals may be low. US Patent 7297490 was issued for a
novel DNA microarray that provides a high-throughput
approach for authenticating Chinese medicinal materials
by making use of the variable ribosomal RNA sequences
for generating the array [53]. Three medicinal plants, Ilex
asprella, Ilex latifolia, and Ilex rotunda, were employed. ITS
regions of these samples were first sequenced and compared. Primers were designed for the amplification of the
polymorphic ITS-1 and ITS-2 regions. The amplified fragments are spotted onto a nylon membrane. To generate
the probe, the whole ITS-1 and ITS-2 sequences are amplified and labeled by DIG-High Prime. After hybridizing the
probes to the nylon membrane, signals are detected by
DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit. When the probe from a

While the demand for DNA authentication is still
restricted to endangered, toxic, or high-value medicinal
materials, with regulations that require more accurate
authentication of herbal materials and an increasing
demand for high-quality herbs, the market demand for
DNA authentication of medicinal materials will increase,
thereby increasing the number of patents for new technologies. Improvements to existing technologies are expected
to further advance the field of DNA authentication of
herbal materials.
