Abstract
To determine whether the novel porcine parvovirus type 4 (PPV4) recently reported in America is prevalent in
China, a set of specific primers was designed and used for molecular survey of PPV4 among the clinical samples
collected from various provinces of China between 2006 and 2010. The results showed that PPV4 is present in Chinese swine herds at a rate of 2.09% (12/573) among the clinical samples examined and 0.76% (1/132) among the
samples taken from healthy animals. We also noted that PPV4 was not detected in samples taken prior to 2009.
Analysis of the coding sequences showed that the Chinese and American PPV4 genome sequences are closely
related with greater than 99% nucleotide sequence identity. Similar to a previous study, viral genomes in head-totail configuration of various lengths of the non-coding region were detected. Our findings confirmed that PPV4 is a
unique recently discovered virus in pigs. Phylogenetically, PPV4 is most closely related to bovine parvovirus 2
(BPV2, which is not a Bocavirus and is not assigned to any Parvovirinae genus) and shares limited ORF1 (33.6%) and
ORF2 (24.5%) amino acid identity. With respect to genome structure and organization, PPV4 encodes an ORF3 in
the middle of the viral genome that resembles the Bocavirus genus. However, the PPV4 ORF3 encoded protein
shares minimal amino acid identity with the ORF3 encoded proteins of the Bocavirus genus.
Findings
The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
has classified the Parvovirinae subfamily of viruses into
five genera: Dependovirus, Bocavirus, Erythrovirus, Parvovirus and Amdovirus. Recently, two new genera, Hokovirus and Cnvirus, have been proposed. Hokovirus
includes a group of porcine and bovine isolates that
clustered with the human PARV4 and PARV5 viruses
[1,2] and Cnvirus includes the H-1 isolate from Myanmar [3] and a group of newly identified porcine isolates
from China that exhibit a distinct sublineage from the
Hokovirus [4,5]. In addition, there are two bovine isolates (BPV2 and BPV3) and one porcine isolate (PPV4)
that do not cluster with any member of the Parvovirinae
genera [6]. The genomes of the Parvovirinae members
are linear single-stranded DNA of about 5 kilobases that
contain terminal palindromic sequences. In general, the
genome encodes two major open reading frames (ORFs)
coding for the non-structural protein(s) located at the
5’-end and the capsid protein(s) located at the 3’-end.

An additional ORF3 located in the middle of the viral
genome was observed among viruses of the Bocavirus
genus (bovine parvovirus [BPV1], canine minute virus
[MVC], human bocavirus [HBoV], and, potentially, a
partially sequenced porcine boca-like virus [Pbo-likeV])
[7,8]. PPV4 is unique in that its genome nucleotide
sequence is most related to BPV2, but the coding capacity and genome organization are more related to
viruses of the Bocavirus genus [6]. Limited amino acid
identity, ORF1 (33.6%) and ORF2 (24.5%), exists
between PPV4 and BPV2. The ORF3 amino acid identity
among the three recognized Bocavirus members is 43.347.0%. Whereas the Pbo-likeV ORF3 shares 33.6-35.6%
amino acid identity with the recognized Bocaviruses, the
PPV4 ORF3 shares only 4.9-11.2% [6-8]. The ORF3 of
Pbo-likeV and PPV4 share low nucleotide identity (45%)
and amino acid identity (17.5%), which indicate PbolikeV and PPV4 are two distinct parvoviruses.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether PPV4
exists among swine herds in China by a PCR assay. A
total of 705 animals were examined. A sample was collected from each pig (573 sick animals and 132 healthy
animals) in 12 provinces of China from 2006 to 2010
(100 samples in 2006, 100 samples in 2007,100 samples

in 2008,281 samples in 2009,124 samples in 2010). The
sick pigs exhibited clinical symptoms that encompassed
trembling, fever, testicular atrophy, abortion and death.
The samples included 386 sera and 319 tissues from
various organs. Briefly, viral DNA was extracted using
a DNA/RNA extraction kit (catalog # DP315, Tiangen
Biotech Inc., Beijing, China). Based on the PPV4
genomic sequence (GenBank accession numbers:
GQ387499) [9], a pair of detection primers [PPV4-F (5’GGGCGAGAACATTGAAGAGGT-3’) and PPV4-R (5’TTGTGAGTATGGGTATTGTGT-3’)] targeting a 543
nucleotide sequence within ORF2 were used. The PCR
reaction was performed according to manufacturer’s
instruction (catalog # KT201-2, Tiangen Biotech Inc.,
China). The cycling program was as follows: pre-denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s,
53°C for 30 s and 72°C for 40 s, final extension for 10
min at 72°C. The PCR products were gel-purified and
cloned into the PCR2.1T/A vector (Invitrogen Corporation, California, U.S.A.). Nucleotide sequences
were determined using an AB-3730 automated DNA
sequencer and the results obtained were analyzed with
the BLASTx program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
blast/. The results showed that 12 out of 573 clinical
samples and 1 out of 132 healthy pig samples were
positive for PPV4. PPV4-positive pigs were not
detected among samples collected from 2006-2008.
Eight of the positive samples were collected in 2009
and the other five were collected in 2010 and they
came from five different breeding pig farms located in
three provinces of China. Although the overall detection rate was low (13/705 = 1.84%), the rate in each
positive farm was high: 37% (7/19), 25% (1/4), 40%
(2/5), 20% (2/10) and 50% (1/2). Among the thirteen
PPV4-positive samples identified, 10 samples were
from adult pigs (7 sows about seven months and 3
boars about four months old), two from a dead piglet
(about 8 weeks old) and one from a healthy piglet
(about 4 weeks old). The adult pigs were diagnosed
with reproductive failure, while the sick piglet had displayed fever and neurologic symptoms. Further analysis
showed that PPV4 DNA existed in the heart, serum,
lymph node, lung and kidney, with the heart containing the highest viral load (data not shown).
To explore whether there were any co-infecting
viruses present in our PPV4-positive pigs, we investigated the presence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus 2
(PCV2), classic swine fever (CSFV), PPV1, PPV2, PPV3,
pseudorabies virus (PrV) and porcine torque teno virus
(genogroups 1 [PTTV1] and 2 [PTTV2]) according to
the protocols previously described [1,3,9-11]. The results
revealed that all 13 PPV4-positive samples were coinfected with both PTTV1 and PTTV2, while 4 out of

13 samples (30.7%) were co-infected with PCV2. The
other viruses examined were not detected.
Three PPV4-positive pigs (2 sows and 1 boar) from
two farms in two provinces: Jiangsu (JS0910 and JS0918,
from the same farm) and Henan (HEN0922) were
selected for full-length genome sequence determination.
Seven pairs of primers (Table 1) (based on of GenBank
sequence GQ387500) [6] were designed and used to
determine the coding sequences, in the 5’ to 3’ orientation, from the beginning of ORF1, through ORF3, to the
end of ORF2. The nucleotide sequences obtained were
assembled using the Seqman software and aligned using
CLUSTALW of alignment software and a phylogenetic
tree was generated using MEGA 4.1 software [12] and
the neighbor-joining method [13].
Sequence analysis revealed that the JS0910 sample
yielded 2 variants, the JS0918 sample yielded 3 variants
and the HEN0922 sample yielded 2 variants. These
seven PPV4 genomes contained three major ORFs,
which included a putative replicase (ORF1), an ORF3 of
unknown function and a capsid gene (ORF2). The coding capacity of each ORF was identical to that of the
American PPV4 [6]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
these Chinese PPV4 genomes clustered with the American PPV4 genomes. Among the Chinese isolates, the
nucleotide sequence identity of ORF1 was 99.1- 99.3%,
ORF2 was 99.2-99.8% and ORF3 was 99.2-99.3%.
Between the Chinese isolates and the American isolates,
nucleotide identity of ORF1 was 99.7-99.8%, ORF2 was
99.2-99.8% and ORF3 was 99.7-99.8%. Among the
Chinese isolates, the amino acid identity of ORF1 was

Huang et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:333
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/333

98.9-99.3%, ORF2 was 99-100% and ORF3 was 99.399.6%. Between the Chinese isolates and the American
isolates, the amino acid identity of ORF1 was 99.8-100%,
ORF2 was 98.5-99% and ORF3 was 99.7-99.9%.
Previous work demonstrated that head-to-tail circular
or concatameric PPV4 genomes exist in tissues of the
infected animals [6]. Primers designed specifically to
detect head-to-tail covalently linked sequences used in
the previous study were employed to determined the
head-to-tail junction sequences of the seven PPV4 genomes obtained. PCR experiments yielded head-to-tail
products of four difference sizes. After sequence determination and assembly, it was noted that the sizes of the
seven genomes ranged from 5400 to5644 nucleotides (nt)
(GenBank accession numbers: GU978964-GU978968,
HM031134-HM031135). In comparison with the genomes of the American PPV4 (5780-5905 nt), all the
Chinese PPV4 genomes examined were smaller and the
deleted sequence in each genome was located between nt
5964-595 in the non-coding region. The 5400 nt genome
(GU978964, GU978968 and HM031134) was detected in
all 3 pigs that came from 2 different provinces and the
5644 nt genome (GU978965 and GU978967) was
detected in 2 pigs from the same farm. Interestingly, the
nucleotide deletions of the three 5400 nt genomes were
identical and the nucleotide deletions of the two 5644 nt
genomes were also identical.
In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated
that PPV4 existed in some breeding pig farms in
China, probably since 2009. Phylogenetically, the Chinese and American PPV4s are closely related and cluster in the same clade. They share greater than 99%
nucleotide sequence identity in all 3 ORFs. The American PPV4 was first identified among swine suffering
from an acute onset disease of high mortality in North
Carolina, USA during late 2005 [14]. Examination of
the farm records showed that the two PPV4-positive
Chinese farms had purchased swine from a common
source in North Carolina prior to the discovery of
PPV4. Since the Chinese and American PPV4s are very
similar with respect to nucleotide sequence and deletions in the non-coding region, it is possible that PPV4
was introduced into China through the importation of
PPV4-infected pigs from the U.S. This study also confirmed previous study [6] that circular or head-to-tail
concatameric PPV4 molecules were present in the the
diseased animals. The head-to-tail configured PPV4
genomes are likely generated via circularization of the
genome in which the left-end and right-end of the linear genome are covalently linked. It is not surprising
that some terminal nucleotides of the linear genome
may have been deleted during the circularization process, which is observed in this and previous studies.
Similar to that of a Dependovirus, adeno-associated

Page 3 of 4

virus type 2, the presence of head-to-tail configured
molecules in the infected animals suggests that PPV4
may be able to establish persistence in its host [15,16].
The fact that PPV4 was detected in diseased animals
with other co-infecting viruses, further investigations
are needed to determine the pathogenic capability of
PPV4 and surveillance studies are needed to determine
whether PPV4 could spread and become a serious
emerging swine pathogen.
