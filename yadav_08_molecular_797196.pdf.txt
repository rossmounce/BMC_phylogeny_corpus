Abstract
Umbre (UMB) virus was first isolated from India in 1955 and classified as Orthobunyavirus (Turlock
serogroup). Eight isolates of this virus, isolated from Culex mosquitoes were characterized on the
basis of partial glycoprotein (G2) gene. Twenty-six percent differences at nucleotide level while
17% differences at amino acid level were noted within different isolates. Phylogentic data shows
that this virus represents a distinct group within the genus Orthobunyavirus.

Findings
The viruses of Bunyaviridae family are spherical particles,
range 80 to 120 nm in diameter and share a common
genetic organization of three predominantly negative
stranded RNA segments (S, M and L). Based on antigenic,
genetic and ecological relatedness, the Bunyaviruses are
divided into five genera. The genus Orthobunyavirus
includes approximately 60 viruses, which are known to
cause disease in humans (Elliot, 1996). Virological surveillance of these viruses depends primarily on detecting
the viruses in arthropod vector populations in nature.
Although, serological test like immunoassays are available
for antigen detection for a few viruses, cross-reaction in
closely related viruses cannot be ignored (Artsob et. al.,
1984; Hildreth et. al., 1982).
Umbre virus (UMB) [strain G-1424] was first isolated
from Culex bitaeniorhynchus mosquitoes, collected in 1955
at Umbre, Kolaba district, Maharashtra State, India. The
virus has been registered in the International Arbovirus
Catalogue No. 43 (Dandwate et. al., 1969). During further
field investigations, seven more strains of virus were isolated from Cx. vishnui mosquitoes. Recent reports on Bunyaviruses via. Ganjam virus isolation from Maharashtra
(Joshi et. al., 2004) and antibody detection of Hantan

virus in India (Chandi et. al., 2005), has provided evidences that Bunyaviruses are circulating in this country
but their involvement in causing human and animal disease are not known yet. In the Gene Bank, only one
sequence of Turlock serogroup i.e. N gene of M'poke virus
is available.
UMB viruses used in this study are listed in (Table 1)
along with their geographical origin, host source and year
of isolation. The available eight strains of this virus was
procured from the virus registry of National Institute of
Virology, Pune and propagated in VeroE-6 cells. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed during 4th – 6th post
infection day. Infected cells were harvested, centrifuged
and supernatant was used for molecular characterization
of the virus.
RNAs were isolated using chloroform, isoamylalcohol
and further purified using RNAaid kit (Biogene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNAs were dissolved in 50 μl nuclease free water. Different sets of
primers were used to amplify partial N, L and M gene. Partial M gene of 570 bp could be amplified using primer pair
M14C and M619R, as described by Bowen et. al., (2001),
represents the nucleotide sequences of the N-terminal half

of the G2 glycoprotein. Superscript III single step RT-PCR
with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase kit (Invitrogen) was
used for amplification of partial M gene according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Amplified products were detected in 2% agarose gel after
staining with ethidium bromide in Tris/acetate/EDTA
buffer (TAE). A desired size of 575 bp product was purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), as per
manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of amplified
products were determined by using ABI PRISM BigDye
Terminator V3.1 cycle sequencing ready reaction kit
(Applied Biosystems). Amplification primers were used to
sequence the amplified products. Cycle sequencing PCR
program was used for 96°C-1 min, 96°C-10 sec, 50°C-5
sec and extension of 2 min at 60°C for 30 cycles.
The partial M gene sequence was curetted with the help of
KODON Software and aligned with known Gene Bank
sequences of Bunyamwera serogroup, California serogroup, and Kaeng Khoi viruses using clastal W program.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Mega 3.0 by
using neighbor-joining algorithm with thousand bootstrap values.
Partial M gene sequences showed maximum homology
with Bunyamwera serogroup virus. Nucleotide and amino
acid similarity within eight isolates varied from 74–100%
and 83–99% respectively. Isolate G1424 and 809365
come together with 6% and 1% difference of nucleotide
and amino acid respectively, while other six isolates club
together with 5% nucleotide and 4% amino acid differences (Figure 1). Nucleotide and amino acid homology in
UMB viruses ranged from 49–75% and 25–84% respectively with other Orthobunyaviruses. There were 26
amino acid conserved sites as compared to other
Orthobunyaviruses.

isolate [strain no. G 1424] and the last isolate [strain no.
809365] from India showed maximum similarity while
other six isolates club together. Phylogenetic analysis of
genetically characterized member of the genus
Orthobunya (345 bp of glycoprotein gene G2, data not
shown) are divides into six distinct lineage viz. Bunyamwera, Simbu, California encephalitis, Group C, Kaeng Khoi
(KK) and UMB virus. Comparison of 550 bp of partial M
gene showed four lineages, excluding Group C viruses and
Simbu group of virus (Figure 1). The genetic divergence
between these lineages suggests that UMB virus represent
a distinct group within the genus Orthobunya.
UMB virus strain G 1424 and 809365 not only highly
homologues on the genomic level but also in their cell
infectivity pattern. These two strains took more time to
show CPE in comparison of other six isolates. Complete
genome sequencing may shed light, why these two isolates are separate from other six, which club together
despite isolated from two different mosquito species.
Turlock and Umbre virus are distinct from each other
based on neutralization test (Calisher et al., 1984). Availability of more sequences of Turlock group may answer
about placement of this group of viruses. Bunyaviruses
being three segmented RNA viruses have the capacity to
reassort their segments into new genetically distinct
viruses, if the target cells are subject to dual infection. The
possibility of drift, shift and UMB virus evolution towards
an emerging disease pathogen cannot be predicted based
on partial sequences. Complete genome sequencing of
UMB virus can possibility suggest whether there is any
reassortment between three genes of this virus as known
for Ngeri, Batai and Jatobal virus (Briese et. al., 2006;
Yanase et. al., 2006; Saeed et. al., 2001).

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

UMB virus was isolated from two different species of
Culex mosquitoes i.e. Cx. bitaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui
which were collected from three different states. Both the
species have different host range and breeding habitats,
but the viruses obtained from these mosquito species
were not different on the genomic bases. The first UMB
