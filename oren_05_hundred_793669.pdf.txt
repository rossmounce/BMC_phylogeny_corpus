Abstract
A hundred years have passed since the description of the genus Dunaliella, the unicellular green alga
which is responsible for most of the primary production in hypersaline environments worldwide.
The present paper provides an historical survey of research on Dunaliella, from the early work in
the 19th century to the thorough taxonomic studies by Teodoresco, Hamburger, Lerche and others
from the beginnig of the 20th century onwards. It attempts to trace the origin of some of the most
important breakthroughs that have contributed to our present understanding of this alga that plays
such a key role in many hypersaline environments.

1. Introduction
A hundred years have passed since the description of the
genus Dunaliella, the unicellular green alga which is
responsible for most of the primary production in hypersaline environments worldwide. First sighted in 1838 in
saltern evaporation ponds in the south of France by
Michel Felix Dunal [1], it was named after its discoverer by
Teodoresco in 1905 [2].
In the century that has elapsed since its formal description, Dunaliella has become a convenient model organism
for the study of salt adaptation in algae. The establishment
of the concept of organic compatible solutes to provide
osmotic balance was largely based on the study of
Dunaliella species. Moreover, the massive accumulation of
β-carotene by some strains under suitable growth conditions has led to interesting biotechnological applications.
The present paper provides an historical survey of research
on Dunaliella, from the early work in the 19th century to
the thorough taxonomic studies by Teodoresco, Hamburger, Lerche and others from the beginning of the 20th

century onwards. It attempts to trace – often through quotations from the original articles – the origin of some of
the most important breakthroughs that have contributed
to our present understanding of this alga that plays such a
key role in many hypersaline environments.
Extensive additional information on the alga can be
found in a review by Ginzburg [3], in the multi-author
review edited by Avron and Ben-Amotz [4], and in my
monograph on halophilic microorganisms and their environments [5].

2. Reports on Dunaliella Prior to 1905
The first description of a unicellular biflagellate redcolored alga living in concentrated brines (Fig. 1) was
given in 1838 by Dunal [1], who reported occurrence of
the organism we know today as Dunaliella salina in the salterns of Montpellier, on the Mediterranean coast of
France. He named the organisms observed Haematococcus
salinus and Protococcus. The discovery of these algae was
made in the framework of an investigation, invited by the
Académie des Sciences, Paris, of the cause of the red

coloration of saltern brines. At the time it was widely
assumed that chemical and physical parameters are
responsible for the coloration of these brines. Dunal
refuted an earlier claim that the color is due to the brine
shrimp Artemia salina. The Académie then appointed a
committee to reexamine the matter, and this committee
confirmed Dunal's finding [6]; see also [7]. Another idea
brought forward during that period was that Artemia contributes to the color due to the partially digested and
decaying red flagellates ("Monas Dunalii") present in its
intestine [8]. Nowadays it is clear that, although β-caro-

tene-rich Dunaliella salina are indeed present in the saltern
ponds, most of the coloration of the crystallizer brine is
caused not by the algae but by red halophilic Archaea
instead [9,10].
In the course of the 19th century, Dunal's red flagellate
algae has been observed by other biologists as well in salt
lakes and other hypersaline sites in Crimea [11,12], Algeria [13], Lorraine, France [14] and Romania [15]. Different names were attached to the organism by each
investigator [1,8,11,13,15-20] (Table 1).

also can fill in certain still existing gaps in the knowledge,
and also because my results were obtained independently
of those of Teodoresco, I still would like to publish them.]
Teodoresco studied material collected from a Romanian
salt lake, while Hamburger worked with samples sent to
her from the salterns of Cagliari, Sardinia. Both authors
presented detailed drawings of the organisms (Fig. 2 and
3) and provided extensive information on its morphology, cell structure, reproduction, behavior and ecology. A
formal description of the genus Dunaliella, named in
honor of Dunal who had first seen these organisms in salterns in France almost seventy years earlier, and of the first
two species within the genus, D. salina and D. viridis, was
published in 1906 [20].

3. The Description of the Genus Dunaliella
The year 1905 saw the publication of two papers presenting in-depth descriptions of Dunaliella as a new genus,
one by E.C. Teodoresco from Bucharest [2] and the second
written by Clara Hamburger from Heidelberg [7]. Teodoresco's publication preceded that by Hamburger, who
only learned about the Teodoresco paper when finalizing
the writing of her own article [7]:
"Anfang März wollte ich an die Ausarbeitung meiner Notizen gehen, als ich am 10. März von Herrn Prof. Lauterborn eine Arbeit von Teodoresco mit dem Titel:
"Organisation et développement du Dunaliella, nouveau
genre de Volvocaceae – Polyblepharidée erhielt, welche as
Separatdruck aus dem botanischen Centralblatt soeben
versendet war. Dunaliella ist der von mir untersuchte
Organismus, den ich schon als Vertreter einer neuen Gattung erkannt hatte. Unsere Resultaten stimmten in vielen
Punkten überein, in anderen müssen meiner Ansicht nach
erst weitere Untersuchungen die entgültige Entscheidung
bringen. Da jedoch meine Studien, besonders bezüglich
des innern Baues eingehender sind (Teodoresco hat nur
lebendes Material untersucht) und ich auch einige noch
bestehende Lücken ausfüllen kann; da ferner alle meine
Resultate unbeinflußt von denen Teodoresco's erhalten
wurden, so möchte ich sie dennoch veröffentlichen."
[In the beginning of March [1905] I wanted to start to
work out my notes, when on March 10 I received from
Prof. Lauterborn a paper by Teodoresco entitled: "Organization and development of Dunaliella, a new genus of the
Volvocida – Polyblepharidae", which was just sent as offprint from the Botanisches Centralblatt. Dunaliella is the
organism that I had been investigating, and that I had
already recognized as representative of a new genus. Our
results corresponded in many respects, while in other
respects I am of the opinion that further investigations
will have to decide. However, because my studies, especially with respect to the internal structure, are more thorough (Teodoresco had studied only live material) and I

The papers by Teodoresco and Hamburger were soon followed by others. Noteworthy studies in the early years of
Dunaliella research are articles by Cavara [21], who
extended the study of the organism in the Cagliari, Sardinia salterns, a study of the algae in the Salton Sea, California [22], a series of ecological papers by Labbé based
on observations made in the salterns of Le Croisic on the
Atlantic coast of France [23-25], articles by Baas Becking
and coworkers, who collected specimens from all over the
world [26-28], and the taxonomic studies by Hamel [29]
and Lerche [30].

4. The Taxonomy of the Genus Dunaliella
Dunaliella is a genus of unicellar algae belonging to the
family Polyblepharidaceae. Its cells lack a rigid cell wall,
and they reproduce by longitudinal division of the motile
cell or by fusion of two motile cells to form a zygote.
Teodoresco [2,20] described two species: D. salina and D.
viridis. D. salina has somewhat larger cells, and under suitable conditions it synthesizes massive amounts of carotenoid pigments, coloring the cells brightly red. D. viridis
never produces such red cells. It is interesting to note that
in the early years there have been extensive discussions
whether indeed two species are present or whether the red
and the green cells represent different forms of the same
species. For example, Blanchard [13] and Hamburger [7]
considered the green cells as juvenile stages of the red
ones. Labbé [23,24] was of the opinion that differences in
salt concentration of the environment are responsible for
the different colors of the cells. Upon transferring of saltern brine samples to a lower salinity he grew a form of
Dunaliella adapted to fresh water and lacking the brownred pigment. His statements that:

foms that cannot revert to chlorophyll-containing forms,
and are colored by a hematochrome.]

have not withstood the test of time. We now know that
not all Dunaliella species produce massive amounts of carotene, and those that can, do so only under suitable conditions (exposure to high light intensities, nutrient
limitation, etc., see also section 6 below). Lerche [30] thus
saw that under suitable conditions all red clones became
green, but after several weeks they turned olive to yellowgreen and after several months they were red again.
Additional species were later added to the genus, especially thanks to the in-depth studies by Lerche [30] and
Butcher [31] (Table 2). Lerche investigated material collected from salt lakes in Romania and in California, as
well as the above-mentioned Cagliari salterns. She concluded that the former species D. viridis is heterogeneous
and should be split into several new species. Thus the species D. media, D. euchlora, D. minuta, and D. parva were
created. It must be stressed here that not all species mentioned tolerate the extremely high salt concentrations in
which D. salina and D. viridis are found in nature. Some
are typically marine organisms that were never reported to
occur in hypersaline environments.
An in-depth taxonomic treatment of the genus was given
in Massyuk's 1973 monograph [32]. She divided the
genus into two subgenera, Dunaliella (23 species) and
Pascheria (5 species), the latter consisting of freshwater
species only. Some of the species recognized by Massyuk
may eventually be found to be polymorphic forms of a
single taxon [33].
A species of considerable interest is Dunaliella acidophila,
isolated from acidic waters and soils in the Czech Republic and in Italy [34,35]. This is not a true halophile but an
acidophilic alga that grows optimally at pH values
between 0.5 and 2. In recent years it has become a popular
research object for the study of adaptation of life to low
pH environments [36]. Its taxonomic/phylogenetic affili-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/2

ation with the halophilic Dunaliella species has to my
knowledge never been verified.
Molecular phylogeny techniques have been applied to the
taxonomic study of Dunaliella from 1999 onwards. These
studies have encompassed the 18S rRNA genes and the
internal transcribed spacer regions, and have been based
on gene sequence comparisons as well as on restriction
fragment length polymorphism studies. Little correlation
was found between the molecular data and the morphological-physiological attributes used in older studies to
delineate species within the genus [37,38]. On the basis of
18S rRNA gene sequences, Olmos et al. [39] could differentiate between D. salina, D. parva and D. bardawil as species containing one, two and three introns, respectively,
within the 18S rRNA gene. The molecular studies have
made it clear that many culture collection strains are
probably misnamed, and that some unnecessary species
names may have been proposed in the past.

5. Life Stages and Sexual Reproduction in
Dunaliella
Dunaliella salina and some of the other species undergo
complex life cycles that encompass, in addition to division of motile vegetative cells, the possibility of sexual
reproduction. Fusion of two equally sized gametes to
form a zygote was documented in many of the early studies [7,20,29]. We thank a most detailed study of sexual
reproduction in Dunaliella to Lerche [30], who reported
sexual zygote formation in five of the six species studied
(D. salina, D. parva, D. peircei, D. euchlora, and D. minuta).
She reported zygote formation in D. salina to be induced
by a reduction in salt concentration from 10 to 3%. In the
process first the flagella touch, and then the gametes form
a cytoplasmic bridge and fuse. The zygote has a thick outer
layer. It can withstand exposure to freshwater and also survive prolonged periods of dryness. These zygotes germinate with the release of up to 32 haploid daughter cells
through a tear in the cell envelope [30]. It is well possible
that the cyst-like structures observed by Oren et al. [40] at
the end of a bloom of green Dunaliella cells in the Dead
Sea in 1992 were actually such zygotes. In this case, however, the formation of these rounded, thick-walled cells
took place at a time of an increase in water salinity. Lerche
[30] performed a series of elegant experiments in which
carotenoid-rich red cells were crossed with green cells,
enabling the investigator to follow the fusion of the two
parent cells to form a zygote. A few of her drawings to
illustrate the process are reproduced in Fig. 4. The possibility of formation of asexual resting cysts by D. salina was
indicated by Hamburger [7], a finding that was disputed
by Lerche. However, more recently, Loeblich [41] has
reported formation of such cysts in media of reduced
salinity (for a discussion see also [42]).

Some Dunaliella species can also develop a vegetative
palmelloid stage consisting of round non-motile cells.
Lerche [30] has documented this phenomenon in D.
salina cultures at lowered salinities, and Brock [43]
observed such palmelloid forms of Dunaliella in benthic
algal mats of Great Salt Lake, Utah.

6. Carotenoid Pigments of Dunaliella
The pigment responsible for the brightly red coloration
displayed by D. salina, often designated in the older literature as "hematochrome", was recognized already very
early as a carotenoid. As such it was identified by Blanchard [13], and Teodoresco [20], Lerche [30] and Ruinen
[44] confirm this identification based on the solubility of
the pigment in alcohol and in ether and on the blue color
formed in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid.
Before the modern electron microscope showed the β-carotene as granules between the thylakoids of the cell's single chloroplast, considerable differences of opinion
existed regarding the intracellular location of this red carotenoid pigment. Thus, both Teodoresco [2,20] and
Labbé [23] stated that the red pigment was distributed all
over the cells' cytoplasm. Relating to a different claim by
Hamburger [7], Teodoresco [20] wrote:
"je n'hésite pas à croire que ce pigment imprègne tout le
corps des zoospores, excepté, bien entendu, l'extrémité
antérieure, à l'endroit de l'insertion des flagellums."
[I don't hesitate to believe that the pigment impregnates
the whole body of the zoospores, except, of course, the
extreme anterior part, on the place where the flagella are
inserted.]
Likewise, Hamel [29] claimed that at elevated salt concentrations, D. salina forms "hematochrome" that penetrates
not only the "chromophore" (= chloroplast) but the
entire cytoplasm as well. On the other hand, Hamburger
believed the red pigment to be located as small droplets
(which is true, see e.g. [45,46]), but she was mistaken
about the location of the pigment:
"Er tritt in Form kleiner Tröpfchen auf, und ist, wie mir
sicher scheint, nur der äußeren Alveolarschicht des
Plasmas eingelagert, während das Chromatophor Träger
des grünen Farbstoffes ist. Die Bemerkung Teodoresco's
"hématochrome imprégnant non seulement le chromatophore, mais encore tout le corps des individus âgés",
stimmt mit meinen Beobachtungen nicht überein."
[It occurs in the form of small droplets, and is, as seems
sure to me, only deposited in the outer alveolar layer of
the plasma, while the chromatophore is the bearer of the
green pigment. The remark by Teodoresco that "the hema-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/2

tochrome that impregnates not only the chromatophore,
but also the whole body of adult individuals" does not
correspond with my observations.]
Baas Becking [27] correctly located the red-orange pigment in the chloroplast, and Leche [30] realized that the
carotene masks the chlorophyll, so that the chloroplast
can assume all shades from orange-red to yellow-green,
olive and green:
"Der rote Farbstoff ist in Form öliger Tröpfchen zwischen
den Wabe des Chloroplasten eingelagert und nicht wie
Hamburger (1905) annimmt, in der äußeren Alveolarschicht des Protoplasmas."
[The red pigment is located in the form of oily droplets
between the honeycomb structure of the chloroplast and
not, as Hamburger (1905) assumes, in the outer cytoplasmic layer of the protoplast.]

β-Carotene, the major carotenoid accumulated by D.
salina and D. bardawil, is a valuable chemical, in high
demand as a natural food coloring agent, as pro-vitamin
A (retinol), as additive to cosmetics, and as a health food
[47]. Some Dunaliella strains can accumulate very large
amounts of this carotenoid. Thus, as much as 13.8% of
the total dry organic matter in the D. salina community in
Pink Lake, Victoria, Australia, was estimated to be β-carotene [48]. Also in culture some strains may contain up to
10% and more of β-carotene in their dry weight, including
a large percentage of the 9-cis isomer [46]. Therefore the
biotechnological potential of Dunaliella as a source of βcarotene was investigated already relatively early. The first
pilot plant for Dunaliella cultivation for β-carotene production was established in the USSR in 1966 [49,50]. The
commercial cultivation of Dunaliella for the production of
β-carotene throughout the world is now one of the success
stories of halophile biotechnology [51-53]. Different technologies are used, from low-tech extensive cultivation in
lagoons to intensive cultivation at high cell densities
under carefully controlled conditions [54].
One of the methods used in such biotechnological operations to induce massive carotenoid accumulation is reduction of the growth rate by deprivation of nutrients. That a
high carotenoid content of the cells may be caused by
nutrient limitation as well as by high light intensities was
already reported by Lerche [30]:
"Da die Rotfärbung besonders in alten Kulturen auftrat,
lag die Annahme nahe, sie in Zusammenhang mit den
Ernährungsbedingungen und speziell mit dem Fehlen
eines oder mehrerer Stoffe zu bringen. Da Phosphor und
Stickstoff bei der pflanzlichen Ernährung häufig die Stoffe

sind, die im Minimum vorhanden sind, wurde das Augenmerk zunächst auf diese Stoffe gerichtet."
[As the red coloration occurred especially in old cultures,
it was reasonable to assume a correlation with the nutritional conditions and in particular with the lack of one or
more compounds. As phosphorus and nitrogen are in
plant nutrition often the substances present in limiting
amounts, we directed our attention first of all to these
substances.]

7. Population Dynamics of Dunaliella in Salt
Lakes and Salterns
Only few studies have been devoted to the quantitative
evaluation of Dunaliella populations in salt lakes and salterns, the dynamics of their appearance and decline, and
their contribution to the primary production in their habitats. Stephens and Gillespie (1976) reported measurements of the primary production in the south arm of
Great Salt Lake, Utah, performed in 1973 (salinity around
135 g/l). Post [56] reported that in the cold season, round
cyst-like cells of D. salina increased in numbers in the
Great Salt Lake, especially on the lake's bottom. In the
Dead Sea, green Dunaliella cells have been reported since
the 1940s [57]. The first quantitative estimates of the
Dunaliella population in the lake were made in 1964, and
showed very high numbers: up to 4 × 104 cells per ml of
surface water (sampling season not specified) [58]. Systematic monitoring of the population density at different
seasons and depths in the Dead Sea from 1980 onwards
have yielded a clear picture of the factors that determine
development of the alga in this unusual environment.
High concentrations of magnesium and calcium ions are
known to be inhibitory to Dunaliella since Baas-Becking's
earlier studies [27]. Dunaliella blooms therefore occur in
the Dead Sea only when during unusually wet winters the
upper water layers of the lake become sufficiently diluted
to enable growth, and when phosphate, the limiting
nutrient, is available. Such events have been observed in
1980 and again in 1992 [40,59].
Surprisingly, very little is known about the factors that
determine the dynamics of Dunaliella in saltern pond systems. It is therefore interesting to note that some of the
most in-depth studies on this topic were performed in the
early 1920s in the salterns of Le Croisic on the Atlantic
coast of France, where salt making is a seasonal operation.
Labbé [23,25] showed changes in the algal community
structure and related these to changes in salinity
("osmotic pressure; viscosity") of the brine, but he also
recognized the role of the light intensity and the water
temperature, as well as that of the pH. Based on the faulty
assumption that the smaller green and the larger red
Dunaliella cells are stages in the development of a single
organism (see section 4 above), he described an annual

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/2

cycle in which in the beginning of the winter few red
motile cells ("érythrospores") and smaller green motile
cells ("chlorospores") are present [24]. Dilution of the
water by winter rains triggers the formation of red cysts
("érythrocystes"), but the "chlorospores" develop rapidly,
conjugate, and form "chlorocystes". When the salt concentration increases in the summer season, red motile
cells start to appear, always accompanied by green cells:
"Peu à peu, les érythrospores provenant de chlorospores
prolifèrent, et leur dominance est fonction de la concentration saline."
[Gradually the "erythrospores" that are formed from
"chlorospores" proliferate, and their dominance is a function of the salt concentration.]

8. Cultivation and Salt Tolerance of Dunaliella
The first controlled experiments to evaluate the effect of
salinity on the growth rate of different Dunaliella isolates
were reported in the 1930s. Baas-Becking [27] observed
that D. viridis thrives equally well over the whole range of
1–4 M (6–23%) NaCl and over the pH range 6–9. He
found calcium and magnesium ions in high concentrations to be inhibitory. More detailed and well-documented experiments, using a variety of species and
isolates, were reported by Lerche [30]. She found most
isolates to grow optimally between 2 and 8% salt, with
very slow growth, if at all, at salt concentrations above
15% (Fig. 5). Between 0.47 and 1.22 divisions per day
were recorded under optimal conditions.
The nutritional requirements of different Dunaliella
strains were investigated in-depth by Gibor [60], Johnson
et al. [61], Van Auken and McNulty [62], and others, enabling the optimization of media to grow the alga. Optimal
salt concentrations for cultivation varies according to the
strain, with values reported for D. viridis around 6%, for
D. salina around 12% [42], while different Great Salt Lake
isolates had optima of 10–15% or even 19% salt [43,62].
A general trend, observed in all these studies, is that the
actual salinity of the environments from which the strains
had been isolated was always much higher than the salt
concentration found to be optimal in laboratory experiments. This may well reflect the fact that growth of an
organism occurs in a certain environment not necessarily
means that that environment is optimal for its development, but rather that the organism performs there better
than all its competitors.

9. Osmotic Behavior of Dunaliella Cells
Dunaliella cells lack a rigid cell wall, and the cell is
enclosed solely by a thin elastic plasma membrane. As a
result, the cells' morphology is strongly influenced by
osmotic changes. This was documented already in the

early days. The descriptions by Teodoresco [2] are very
exact here, and they deserve to be cited unabridged:

méchanique de la pression osmotique trop élevée par rapport à la densité diminuée du milieu ambiant."

"Ces zoospores sont dépourvues de membrane cellulosique; celle-ci est représentée par une enveloppe qui possède une certaine souplesse et une certaine extensibilité,
qui permet au corps de prendre les formes assez variées,
suivant la concentration de l'eau. A ce point de vue, le
genre Dunaliella diffère totalement de toutes les espèces de
Chlamydomonas ..."

[If to a drop of salt water one adds a larger drop of fresh
water, which leads to a sudden drop in concentration, the
zoospores not only round up, but in addition cease their
movements; the volume of the body increases and sometimes becomes twice as large, and finally the zoospore
bursts. The cause of this burst is not difficult to understand: it is the mechanical action of the too high osmotic
pressure in comparison to the decreased density of the
ambient medium.]

[These zoospores are devoid of a cellulose cell wall;
instead there is a cell envelope that possesses a certain
flexibility and a certain elasticity, which allows the body
to take quite different forms, in accordance with the [salt]
concentration of the water. In this respect the genus
Dunaliella differs completely from all species of
Chlamydomonas ...]

Lerche [30] likewise observed the osmotic changes that
occur when the salt concentration is changed. She noted
that when a drop of D. salina cells suspended in 20% salt
is flooded with distilled water, a large fraction of the cells
burst, but some cells survived the treatment.

and:

10. Intracellular Salt and Solute Concentrations
of Dunaliella

"Ainsi, si nous plaçons une goutte d'eau salée, contenant
des zoospores, sur le porte-objet, on constate, au microscope, qu'elles se présentent sous la forme mentionée plus
haut. Mais si nous laissons la goutte s'évaporer un peu, on
observe que le corps commence à s'allonger et à se
difformer ... ; si alors nous ajoutons à la préparation une
goutte d'eau douce, les zoospores s'arrondissent
brusquement .... Cette expérience, que j'ai répétée un trés
grand nombre de fois, m'a toujours donné les mêmes
résultats."

Marrè and Servetta ([63], as cited in [61]) described measurements of the freezing point of the cytoplasmic fluid of
D. salina to obtain information on the intracellular salt
concentration. The results indicated an apparent "salt"
concentration that exceeded the 3.9 M salt in which the
cells were grown. At the time it was postulated that NaCl
is taken up through the allegedly very permeable cell
membrane during salt upshock, followed by free water
flux to equalize intracellular and extracellular osmotic
pressures [63-65].

[Thus, when we place a drop of salt water that contains
zoospores [= motile vegetative cells] on a microscope
slide, one detects in the microscope that these present
themselves in the above-described form. However, when
we let the drop evaporate a little, one observes that the
body starts to elongate and to lose its shape. ... ; when we
then add to the preparation a drop of fresh water, the
zoospores suddenly round up. .... This experiment, which
I have repeated a great number of times, has always given
me the same results.]

That the salt concentrations within Dunaliella cells cannot
be that high, was convincingly shown by the enzymological studies by Johnson et al. (1968), who demonstrated
that some of the key enzymes of the algal metabolism
such as pentose phosphate isomerase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
and phosphohexose isomerase, are strongly inhibited by
NaCl. We now know that the intracellular ionic concentrations of Dunaliella are very low indeed. Using lithium
ions as a marker for the extracellular water space to estimate the intracellular volume, the intracellular Na+ concentrations, both in cells grown in 0.5 M and in 4 M NaCl,
was found not to exceed 100 mM [66]. Such low intracellular Na+ levels are achieved by the activity of a Na+/H+
antiporter in the cytoplasmic membrane [67], as well as
by direct electron transport-coupled Na+ extrusion [68].

The phenomena described above are illustrated in Fig. 2,
drawings 9–29 and 30–31, respectively. Teodoresco further writes:
"Si à une goutte d'eau salée on ajoute une goutte plus
grande d'eau douce, ce qui amène une abaissement
brusque de la concentration, les zoospores non seulement
s'arrondissent, mais encore cessent leurs mouvements; le
volume du corps augmente et devient parfois deux fois
plus grand et à la fin la zoospore éclate. La cause de cet
éclatement n'est pas difficile à comprendre: c'est l'action

The enigma of the apparent incompatibility between the
low intracellular ionic concentrations and the need for
osmotic equilibrium of the cells' contents with the external medium was solved with the discovery that the cells
accumulate photosynthetically produced glycerol as
osmotic, "compatible" solute. It is interesting to note that

the first experiments in which the effects of glycerol on
Dunaliella were tested had already been performed by Teodoresco [20], almost hundred years ago. He examined the
effect of glycerol and other non-ionic compounds that
normally cause plasmolysis. He observed that D. salina
cells temporarily lose their motility when suspended in
50% glycerol, but that motility is rapidly restored when
the glycerol concentration is then slightly lowered in a
humid environment. With 75% glycerol results were
largely similar, except that a large fraction of cells died,
and in 100% glycerol only few cells survived.

inside the cell. The causes of the low glycerol permeability
of the Dunaliella membrane are still not fully understood.

The first indications that glycerol is accumulated by
Dunaliella to provide osmotic balance can be found in a
short paper published in 1964 by Craigie and McLachlan
[69]. They incubated D. tertiolecta with 14CO2, then
extracted the cells with ethanol, separated the neutral fraction containing soluble carbohydrates and related compounds using ion exchange procedures, and characterized
the compounds by two-dimensional paper chromatography and autoradiography. When the salinity of the
medium was increased 100-fold from 0.025 to 2.5 M, 94fold more radioactivity was found in the neutral fraction.
Glycerol amounted to 56, 76, and 81% of the radioactivity
of the neutral fraction extracted from cells incubated in
0.025, 0.5, and 2.5 M NaCl, respectively, most of the
remainder probably consisting of soluble polysaccharides. In a subsequent study, Wegmann [70] confirmed
that the proportion of the radiolabel from 14C-bicarbonate that ends up as glycerol increases with increasing salt
concentration up to 2.8 M. He postulated that "The glycerol formation is considered to be a protective mechanism
for the survival of Dunaliella in its natural habitat".

11. Proteomics Approaches to the
Understanding of Salt Tolerance in Dunaliella

The role that glycerol plays in the salt adaptation of
Dunaliella was firmly established by the studies of BenAmotz and Avron [71] and Borowitzka and Brown [72].
The concept of "compatible solutes", a term coined by
Duncan Brown to indicate solutes that not only contribute to the osmotic status of the cell but also maintain
enzyme activity under conditions of low water activity,
was largely based on the study of the function of glycerol
in Dunaliella.
Intracellular glycerol concentrations in Dunaliella can be
very high indeed: cells grown in 4 M NaCl were reported
to contain approximately 7.8 M glycerol inside, equivalent to a solution of 718 g l-1 glycerol in water [73]. Maintenance of such a high concentration requires special
properties of the cell membrane in view of the fact that
most biological membranes are relatively permeable to
glycerol. It has been established that Dunaliella possesses
a membrane with an unusually low permeability for glycerol [74,75], and this enables the cells to keep the glycerol

Attempts have been made to exploit the high concentrations of glycerol accumulated by Dunaliella as the basis for
the commercial production of this compound. Although
technically the production of glycerol from Dunaliella was
shown to be possible [51,52,76] economic feasibility is
low, and to my knowledge no biotechnological operation
presently exists that exploits the alga for glycerol
production.

A versatile organism such as Dunaliella that can adapt to a
wide variety of salt concentrations can be used as a convenient model to study the formation of specific proteins
as a function of changes in medium salinity. Such proteomic approaches have led to some interesting observations in recent years.
A number of such studies were directed to the detection of
changes in the protein content of the cytoplasmic membrane, whose outer side is exposed to the medium salinity, when the cells are shifted from low to high salinity.
Two membrane proteins were strongly induced by salt
upshock, one with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa
[77] and one of 150 kDa [78]. These proteins have been
purified and characterized. The 60 kDa protein is a carbonic anhydrase that apparently helps the cell to take up
carbon dioxide in concentrated brines in which the solubility of gases is decreased [79]. The 150 kDa protein is an
unusual transferrin-like protein, involved in the transport
of iron into the cell [80].
With a study published in 2004 by Liska et al. [81],
Dunaliella research has entered the era of modern proteomics. Comparison of protein patterns of low-and of
high-salt-grown cells were compared on two-dimensional
gels led to the identification of 76 salt-induced proteins.
Among the proteins up-regulated following salinity stress
were key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, enzymes involved
in starch mobilization and in redox energy production,
regulatory factors in protein biosynthesis and degradation, and a homolog of bacterial Na+-redox transporters.
The results indicate that Dunaliella responds to transfer to
a high salinity by enhancement of photosynthetic CO2
assimilation and by diversion of carbon and energy
resources for synthesis of glycerol. This beautiful study is
a worthy conclusion of the first century of Dunaliella
research, and provides us with a preview of the kind of
information that may be expected to be obtained in the
coming years, using approaches of genomics, proteomics
and systems biology.
