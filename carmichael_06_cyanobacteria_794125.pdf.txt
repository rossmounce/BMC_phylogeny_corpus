Abstract
Background: The Salton Sea (SS) is the largest inland body of water in California: surface area 980
km2, volume 7.3 million acre-feet, 58 km long, 14–22 km wide, maximum depth 15 m. Located in
the southeastern Sonoran desert of California, it is 85 m below sea level at its lowest point. It was
formed between 1905 and 1907 from heavy river flows of the Colorado River. Since its formation,
it has attracted both people and wildlife, including flocks of migratory birds that have made the
Salton Sea a critical stopover on the Pacific flyway. Over the past 15 years wintering populations of
eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) at the Salton Sea, have experienced over 200,000 mortalities. The
cause of these large die-offs remains unknown. The unique environmental conditions of the Salton
Sea, including salinities from brackish freshwater at river inlets to hypersaline conditions, extreme
daily summer temperatures (>38°C), and high nutrient loading from rivers and agricultural drainage
favor eutrophic conditions that encourage algal blooms throughout the year. A significant
component of these algal blooms are the prokaryotic group – the Cyanophyta or blue-green algae
(also called Cyanobacteria). Since many Cyanobacteria produce toxins (the cyanotoxins) it became
important to evaluate their presence and to determine if they are a contributing factor in earedgrebe mortalities at the Salton Sea.
Results: From November 1999 to April 2001, 247 water and sediment samples were received for
phytoplankton identification and cyanotoxin analyses. Immunoassay (ELISA) screening of these
samples found that eighty five percent of all water samples contained low but detectable levels of
the potent cyclic peptide liver toxin called microcystins. Isolation and identification of
cyanobacteria isolates showed that the picoplanktonic Synechococcus and the benthic filamentous
Oscillatoria were dominant. Both organisms were found to produce microcystins dominated by
microcystin-LR and YR. A laboratory strain of Synechococcus was identified by PCR as being closest
to known marine forms of this genus. Analyses of affected grebe livers found microcystins at levels
that may account for some of the acute mortalities.
Conclusion: The production of microcystins by a marine Synechococcus indicates that microcystins
may be a more common occurrence in marine environments – a finding not recognized before this
work. Further research should be done to define the distribution of microcystin producing marine
cyanobacteria and to determine exposure/response effects of microcystins and possibly other
cyanotoxins in the Salton Sea. Future efforts to reduce avian mortalities and remediate the Salton
Sea should evaluate vectors by which microcystins enter avian species and ways to control and
mitigate toxic cyanobacteria waterblooms at the Salton Sea.

Background
Beginning in the 1990's, massive avian and fish epornitics
have occurred in the Salton Sea and over 200,000 eared
grebes have died [1]. The largest single epizootic occurred
in 1992 when an estimated 155,000 birds, primarily eared
grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), died from an undiagnosed
cause. The cause of these massive grebe epornitics remains
unknown, although several diseases such as avian botulism and avian cholera have been diagnosed [2]. Algal
biotoxins, especially those produced by dinoflagellates,
have also been listed as a possible contributing cause [3],
but none of the known dinoflagellate toxins has been
identified to date. Preliminary results from analyses of
phytoplankton samples and eared grebe tissues collected
at the sea in the early 1990's identified microcystins produced by cyanobacteria [[4,5], internal reports to USGS].
Eared grebes winter on the Salton Sea, therefore the epornitic usually occurs annually during the late winter and
early spring. Eared-grebe tissues collected from bird mortalities in the Salton Sea during 1992 – 94 had the cyanotoxin – microcystin – in concentrations high enough to
cause acute toxicity. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) measured values of microcystins, in 25
samples of liver, gizzard and upper gastrointestinal tract
showed levels of microcystin in liver as high as 700 ng/g.
This is well above the known levels of microcystin in liver
that could cause acute lethality (about 200 ng/g) [6].
Forty-nine water samples of phytoplankton, provided by
the US Fish and Wildlife Service, collected in 1995–96,
from the Salton Sea, contained levels of microcystins that
ranged from negative to 2 ppb [Carmichael, internal
reports to the USGS]. These levels are low and not likely
to cause acute toxicity. However the toxin was associated
with an organism smaller than 5 microns. These results
suggest a small planktonic cell or picoplankton (i.e. the
fresh/brackish/marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus)
may be present in the Sea that produces microcystin.
Small planktonic cyanobacteria are known to produce
microcystins [7]. This background data formed the basis

for the hypothesis of this project: Microcystins contribute
to the eared grebe mortalities on the Salton Sea and that a
significant source of organism(s) producing microcystins
is to be found in the picoplankton.
The Salton Sea has salinities that vary from freshwater/
brackish water at the major river outlets to hypersaline
conditions in the sea proper, extreme daily summer temperatures (>40°C), and high nutrient loading (eutrophic
conditions) from rivers and agricultural drainages which
encourages algal blooms throughout the year [8]. These
algal blooms could produce biotoxins that contribute to
the massive fish and avian mortalities at the Salton Sea. In
addition very little is known about algal species that survive under the existing conditions of Salton Sea. The combination of extreme summer temperatures, various saline
water conditions, and nutrient loading provide a unique
opportunity to investigate algal species in the Salton Sea
area. Because very little is known about these algal species,
and their biotoxins, there is high potential for new species
and biotoxin identification that may contribute to an
understanding of the high fish and avian mortalities. The
purpose of this study is to collect water samples for the
identification of algal species and biotoxins (cyanotoxins
only), and to determine the presence of cyanotoxins in
eared grebe tissues.
Bloom and mat-forming cyanobacteria in fresh, brackish
and marine waters produce a wide variety of toxins
including hepatotoxins, neurotoxins and dermatotoxins
(Table 1). Hepatotoxins are the most frequently found
cyanobacterial toxins in fresh and brackish waters worldwide. The most common group, the microcystins and
nodularins, are cyclic peptides consisting of seven or five
amino acids respectively. About 70 different structural
variants of microcystins and a few nodularins are known.
They vary in potency from highly toxic to non-toxic
depending on the specific chemical structure, though
most are very toxic [4,5,9].

Microcystins have been characterized from all of the most
cosmopolitan cyanobacteria genera including Anabaena,
Microcystis, Oscillatoria, Planktothrix, Nostoc, Anabaenopsis
and Hapalosiphon while nodularin is found in the brackish
water species Nodularia spumigena. An alkaloid hepatotoxin cylindrospermopsin is produced by Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Umezakia natans, Raphidiopsis curvata and
Aphanizomenon ovalisporum [10].
Three groups of cyanobacterial neurotoxins are known: (i)
anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a, which mimic the effect
of acetylcholine, (ii) anatoxin-a(s), which is an anticholinesterase and (iii) saxitoxins, which block nerve cell
sodium channels. Anatoxin-a has been found in Anabaena, Oscillatoria and Aphanizomenon, homoanatoxin-a
in Oscillatoria, anatoxin-a(s) in Anabaena, and saxitoxins
in Aphanizomenon, Anabaena, Lyngbya and Cylindrospermopsis. Sixteen confirmed saxitoxins from cyanobacterial
samples have been reported, some of which (the decarbamoyl-gonyautoxins) may be chemical break-down
products in some species.
In marine waters, benthic cyanobacteria such as Lyngbya,
Oscillatoria and Schizothrix may produce toxins causing
severe dermatitis among swimmers in contact with cyanobacteria. Aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxins are protein kinase C activators and potent tumor promoters.
Lyngbyatoxin A exposure has caused severe oral and gastrointestinal inflammations in humans. Trichodesmium sp.
occurring in tropical seas are known to contain an as yet
uncharacterized neurotoxin. Though comparatively
poorly studied, cell wall components, particularly
lipopolysaccharide endotoxins (LPS), from cyanobacteria
may contribute to human health problems associated
with exposure to mass occurrences of cyanobacteria.
Cyanobacteria are also known to produce several other
bioactive compounds, some of which are of medical inter-

est, as well as compounds toxic to other cyanobacteria,
bacteria, algae and zooplankton.
The cyanotoxins are collectively responsible for continued
widespread poisoning of wild and domestic animals and
human fatalities. Avian mortalities from cyanotoxins have
been reported since the early 1900's [11]. More recent
reports of microcystin induced avian mortalities are from
great blue herons [12] and flamingos [13]. While these
events in themselves document the continued concern for
cyanotoxins it is the emerging business of fresh and
marine aquaculture organisms that could be affected most
in the United States. Anthropogenic inputs from agriculture, industry, and municipal wastes coupled with heavy
nutrient loading of use waters by the aquaculture industry
are stimulating blooms of toxigenic cyanobacteria in fresh
and marine aquaculture farms. Cyanotoxins particularly
microcystins have already had significant impacts on
selected aquaculture organisms including salmon,
stripped bass, shrimp and catfish (Table 2). The most
well-defined is the loss of Atlantic net-pen reared salmon
from microcystins produced by as yet unknown organisms [14]. These losses have continued since 1991 and
have caused salmon losses in the state of Washington
[Carmichael unpublished data].

Results
ELISA analyses of the waterbloom field samples showed
that almost all had measurable levels of microcystin but
that no sample had microcystin levels that exceeded more
than 100 µg/L. This was due to the presence of salt which
contributed to the dry weight levels and to the mixed biomass in which not all was toxigenic cyanobacteria. Two
examples of the ELISA-microcystin values found are given
in Table 3 (low and high end of the microcystin values).
The PPIA assay did not respond well to the presence of salt
in these samples and results were not satisfactory for
reporting. It is possible that with more work the sample

Not all phytoplankton were identified in the water samples. Emphasis was given to the toxigenic cyanobacteria. A
summary of the main phytoplankton found in the water
samples is given in Table 4. These cyanobacteria are similar to those reported in other work on phytoplankton in
the Salton Sea. Wood et al. [15] also listed Oscillatoria and
Synechococcus as being very common in their samples
which were obtained during January and June of 1999.
Their work and that of others looking at Salton Sea phytoplankton did not investigate for the presence of cyanotoxins such as the microcystins.
Selected phytoplankton samples from almost all shipments were plated onto agar plus medium and cultured
for isolation of cyanobacteria that may be cyanotoxin producers. During the course of this project 100 samples were
plated and approximately 150 unialgal cultures made.
The isolates were dominated by the filamentous Oscillatoria and the picoplanktonic Synechococcus. Because the

duration of the study was relatively short cultures tested
were those that responded quickly to the particular culture
conditions in our facilities. The culture types found in our
study were again similar to those obtained in a study by
Wood et al. [15]. Of these cultures 50 of the better growing isolates were processed and tested by ELISA for microcystin. Thirty four of the 50 cultured isolates were positive
for microcystins. Values were low and ranged from detectable (0.147 µg/L) to 1 µg/L. Four of these 34 cultures were
identified as Synechococcus and all four were positive for
microcystins by ELISA and LC/MS. Only strain SS-1, of
these four strains, was identified as Synechococcus by PCR.
LC/MS analyses of selected cultures was also used to confirm the presence of microcystin production. Since the
picoplankton have potential to be a significant source of
microcystin year round in the Salton Sea the presence and
type of microcystin in these cultures was analyzed. Figure
1 and 2 shows that microcystin-YR and LR, respectfully,
were present in strain SS-1 of Synechococcus while strain O1 of Oscillatoria contained microcystin-LR (Fig. 3).
Cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences available from
GenBank and those examined in the study were aligned
using the multiple sequence alignment tools in CLUSTAL
W version 1.7 [16]. This was followed by conversion to a
distance matrix. The distance matrix was used to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4) by the neighbor-joining
(NJ) algorithm of CLUSTAL W version 1.7, with multiple
substitutions corrected and positions with gaps excluded.
The seed number for random number generation and the
number of bootstrap trials were set to 111 and 1000,
respectively.

culturing, microcystin analyses and generation of the dendrogram show that microcystin producing Synechococcus
was a member of the Salton Sea phytoplankton during the
course of this study. From the dendrogram results and
comparison with other GenBank gene sequences we
found that the Salton Sea Synechococcus strain tested is
closer to marine strains of Synechococcus than to freshwater strains of this genus. This is significant since it shows
that marine cyanobacteria can produce Microcystins, a
finding not demonstrated until this study. This has implications for the possible presence of microcystins in other
marine environments and may make microcystin a
marine HAB as well as a freshwater HAB toxin.

Five of the 20 shipments contained eared grebe tissuesliver, intestine and stomach contents. Table 5 gives the
values for microcystin in these tissues as measured by
ELISA. Compared with other cases of microcystin poisoning the amounts found in these eared grebe livers are in
the range for acute toxicity and possibly acute-lethal toxicity. For example the average microcystin value in 52 liver
samples from 39 human victims who died from microcystin exposure during dialysis was 223 ng/g [6]. In addition
intraperitoneal dosing of mice showed that 125 ng/g of
microcystin-LR was detectable by ELISA in the livers of
mice exposed to a lethal intraperitoneal injection (100 µg/
kg).

Microcystin types in selected liver samples were analyzed
by LC/MS. Mass peaks indicative for microcystin-LR and
YR were identified although the sensitivity was not low
enough to confirm their presence by LC/MS-MS.

Discussion
The cyanotoxin group microcystins should be considered
as a possible contributing cause of grebe morbidities and
mortalities in the Salton Sea and efforts to remediate the
Salton Sea water quality should take this into account.
Our study did not include controlled exposure studies to
grebes and this is an obvious need for future research in
order to determine the role of cyanotoxins in these toxicities. We also did not investigate the possible routes by
which microcystins vector into grebe livers and intestinesanother important study that should be undertaken.
Finally the finding that all cultured strains of the picoplankton Synechococcus produces microcystin is important
in itself but that in addition the PCR based genetics places
it within the marine Synechococcus cluster is even more sig-

nificant. Clearly more work is needed to extend this finding and clarify if marine Synechococcus producing
microcystin are widespread in the Salton Sea and in other
marine systems. Salinity levels may be a significant factor
in selecting for the microcystin producers. In a study on
the Swan River Australia, Orr et al. [17] demonstrated that
laboratory cultures of microcystin producing Microcystis
aeruginosa were more tolerant to high salt concentrations
and were preferentially selected for, as salt levels were
increased in the culture media.
Efforts to reduce salinity and improve water quality in the
Salton Sea should consider that the genera of cyanobacteria currently in the sea are not high producers of microcystins. If salinities are lowered without also managing
levels of key nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus
other genera of cyanobacteria that produce higher levels
(acute lethal) of microcystins may be selected for. These
genera could include Microcystis and Anabaena. Waterblooms of these genera are typically more intense and

would present a higher risk from cyanotoxin (microcystins, anatoxins, cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxins)
exposures.

Conclusion
An investigation to determine the role of cyanotoxins in
grebe mortalities and morbidities on the Salton Sea was
started in November 1999 and ended in April 2001. Water
sampling dates varied but samples were received from
every month except May, June and July of 2000. Twenty
shipments were received over this 18-month period. Fifteen of the shipments contained water and phytoplankton samples while six contained grebe tissue samples (one
shipment contained both water and tissue samples).
Water samples containing cyanobacteria at numbers giving a visible color to the water samples (approx 105 to 107
cells/ml) were lyophilized and analyzed for microcystins
by ELISA. Approximately 85% of 247 samples were positive for microcystins. Concentrations of microcystins were
typically less than 100 µg/gdw. This concentration is generally less than the needed to cause acute lethal toxicity
from ingestion of bloom samples by mammals.
Throughout the sampling period the majority of water
samples were dominated by the filamentous genus Oscil-

latoria and the picoplanktic genus Synechococcus. Isolation,
culture and ELISA testing for microcystin of 50 strain isolates found that microcystins were produced by all strains
– although at low levels (<1 µg/gdw). The genera producing measurable levels of microcystin included mainly Synechococcus and Oscillatoria. Other positive microcystin
genera included Gloeocapsa, Phormidium, Aphanothece and
Lyngbya.
PCR 16S rRNA analyses was done on one strain of Synechococcus, SS-1. Results confirmed that this strain was Synechococcus and comparison with a marine cluster of
Synechococcus supports a conclusion that this Synechococcus strain is more similar to marine than to freshwater
members of this genus. All four Synechococcus isolates
were shown by ELISA and LC/MS to produce the microcystins-MCYST-LR and MCYST-YR.
Microcystins were detected by ELISA in the majority of
liver and intestine samples from grebes collected due to
morbidity or mortality. The concentrations of microcystins were not always high enough to account for acute
lethal toxicity (< 50 ng/g) but a significant number of liver
samples did contain microcystin levels high enough to
account for acute lethal toxicities (>50 ng/g).

Although the concentration of microcystins in the water
samples and in strain isolates of cyanobacteria were not
high enough to account for acute lethal toxicity, levels in
grebe livers often did suggest acute or acute lethal toxicity
could occur. This suggests that microcystins accumulated,
by an as yet unknown vector(s), in grebe tissues to levels
that could be lethal.

Methods
Sample collection, shipment and handling
Water samples were collected by personnel from the
Salton Sea Wildlife Refuge, as defined by the needs of the
project, the work schedule for the Salton Sea Wildlife Refuge personnel and at times weather and other logistical
conditions. Collections started in November 1999 and
ended in April 2001. Sampling dates varied but samples
were received from every month except May, June and July
2000. Twenty shipments were received over this 18month period. Fifteen of the shipments contained water
and plankton samples while six contained grebe tissue
samples (one shipment contained both water and tissue
samples). Grebe necropsies and tissue shipments were
done by SS Refuge personnel and personnel at the
National Wildlife Health Center-USGS in Madison, Wisconsin (Chris Franson) after collection by Salton Sea personnel. Control grebe tissue samples were arranged by
Chris Franson and were collected at Mono Lake California
during October 2000.

Sample Kits used to collect and ship the toxigenic algae
samples, contained:
1. (1) shipping cooler
2. large liner bag (for lining inside of cooler) and cable-tie
for securing it closed

3. 500 ml-Nalgene sample bottles
4. zip-lock bag (for enclosing sample report form)
5. ice-pack
Sample collection locations
During the time that shipments 1–3 were made a transect
system was used to collect samples. These transects were
set by Salton Sea personnel and covered river inlets, open
waters and near shore areas. Later it was determined that
most phytoplankton was to be found near areas of river
inlets where salinity was lowest. This was also the areas
where bird mortalities were typically highest. This resulted
in 4 sample sites: A=Alamo River, N=New River, O=open
water and 1 location in the north, W=Whitewater River.
Figure 5 gives the overall view of sample sites on the
Salton Sea for this project.
Sample receipt and processing
1. Samples were logged in and then stored at 4°C for phytoplankton analyses and at -80°C in preparation for
lyophilization, extraction and toxin analyses. A typical
treatment regime for these samples was as follows: 1)
Samples were logged in and sample location and conditions were noted. 2) Samples were split, with most of the
sample being lyophilized and a small amount kept back
for phytoplankton examination and identification of
major cyanobacteria present. 3) Since most of the dry
weight of a sample was salt, only visible green or green
brown samples were used for microcystin analyses. 4) All
samples that had identifiable cyanobacteria in them, by
microscopic observation, were placed into either tubes
with liquid culture (CT medium plus salt) or onto agar
plates containing CT medium plus salts. Other cyanobacteria growth media were tested initially including BG-11,

River, O = Open water, W = Whitewater River.

ASM-1 and Z-8 but the CT media plus salt was found to
give the best overall growth results.
Taxonomy of Salton Sea cyanobacteria isolates
Cultured isolates were examined on a Nikon Optiphot
phase microscope with phase and fluorescence optics.
Taxonomy, based on morphological characters, was determined from reference to Komarek and Anagnostidis [18],
Komarek and Anagnostidis [19], Desikachary [20] and
Carpenter [21].
Culture of laboratory isolates
Isolates were made by streaking water or sediment sample
on plates composed of CT+ medium and agar. Colonies
were visually grouped by observation with a dissecting
scope and 2–5 representatives of each type of colony were
lifted from a given plate via micropipette and transferred
to liquid CT+ medium in a 10 ml test tube. From the test
tube cultures, representatives of each type were transferred
to a 4L flask of CT+, aerated and maintained under 24
hour illumination. Cultures were harvested before senescence, spun down in a Sorvall centrifuge at 5000 rpm, the
medium was poured off and the pellet was rinsed with
dionized water to help remove salt. The pellet was transferred to a stainless steel pan, frozen and subsequently
freeze-dried. CT medium content is as given by Watanabe
and Ichimura [22]. The + refers to the addition of NaCl to
the medium (7 g/L).

Detection of microcystins
The most common of the cyanotoxins, likely to be found
in this study, are the cyclic peptide hepatotoxic microcystins and nodularins. Rapid and sensitive methods now
exist for detecting and monitoring these toxins in environmental samples (water, cells, sediment and animal tissue). This includes a sensitive polyclonal antibody
immunoassay, developed by FS Chu at the Univ. of Wisconsin, and adapted by An and Carmichael [23] and Carmichael
and
An
[24].
This
enzyme-linked
immunosorbant assay (ELISA) is sensitive to ppb and the
antibody cross reacts with most of the known microcystins. This chemical assay is complimented by a colorimetric enzyme activity assay [23] that measures the
inhibition of microcystin against protein phosphatase 1
and 2A. Inhibition of PP1 and 2A is the specific mechanism of action for microcystins and is directly related to
microcystins toxicity. These two assays can be used to
monitor and quantitate microcystins in all the various
studies outlined in this proposal.

ELISA assay for the cyclic peptide microcystins (MCYST)
and nodularin (NODLN). The method is based upon the
polyclonal antibody method described by Chu et al.
1989, 1990 and as adapted by An and Carmichael
[23]and Carmichael and An [24]. The level of sensitivity
for microcystin/nodularin using this method is about 0.5
ng/ml. Values below or near this level are not considered
significant. Fifty microliters (50 µl) of sample containing
500 µg of algae is used for the assay. Serial dilutions of 101-10-4 (in duplicate) are used to run the assay.
Samples are run on a PP1 or 2A inhibition assay. The
cyclic peptide liver toxins, microcystin and nodularin,
have been shown to be specific and potent inhibitors of
protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A). Inhibition of these enzymes has been shown to be correlated
with the ability of these toxins to be tumor promoters,
especially liver tumor promotion. The assay is therefore
useful in combination with the ELISA assay (which tests
for presence of the compounds – not all of which are bioactive) as an activity assay (to measure actual toxic effect).
The assay is about 1000 times more sensitive than the
HPLC or mouse bioassay. Assay of PP activity was done by
measuring the rate of color formation from the liberation
of P-nitrophenol from P-nitrophenol phosphate using a
Molecular Devices Corp., Vmax kinetic microplate reader,
Palo Alto, CA. [25].
Preparation of samples for ELISA and LC/MS
Microcystin analysis
Freeze dried cells were extracted in methanol at a ratio of
1 g dry weight cells to 50 mL methanol. Extracts were sonicated for 30 s and placed on a rotating table overnight.
After filtration through a glass fiber filter (1.6 µm pore

size), the supernatants were evaporated to dryness in a
Speedvac. Extracts were resuspended in 5 mL of reagent
grade water and passed through a solid phase extraction
column (Isolute, IST, Glamorgan, UK) containing 500 mg
C18(EC). The column was washed with 5 mL of 20% (v/
v) methanol and microcystins were eluted with 10 mL of
80% (v/v) methanol. The later fraction was evaporated to
dryness in a Speedvac, resuspended in 1 mL of 10% (v/v)
methanol, and subjected to ELISA and LC/MS analysis.

Extraction of tissues
Liver or intestine samples (0.5–1.0 g) were homogenized
in 10 mL of hexane (Power Gen 125 tissue homogenizer,
Fisher Scientific Pennsylvania, USA) at 15000 rpm using a
7 mm saw tooth generator probe (Fisher Scientific, Pennsylvania, USA). After homogenization approximately 1 ml
pf ethanol was added to the sample to break up emulsion
formation. The sample was slowly shaken for about 0.5 hr
on a orbital shaker. After this time the hexane layer was
removed, dried with a stream of air or nitrogen and reconstituted in 0.5 ml of 35% MeOH. Preparation of this sample for separation of the microcystin-containing fraction
was by Isolute C18 packing/3 ml reservoir cartridge. The
100% MeOH fraction from this cartridge was dried under
a stream of air and reconstituted in 1 ml of 5% MeOH.
This fraction was used in the ELISA and LC/MS analyses
[26].

Ten mg of lyophilized or fresh cells (harvested at exponential phase and washed three times with distilled water)
were mixed with microbeads in a 2 mL screwtop polypropylene vial (1:1 with volume), and broken with a MiniBeadbeater (Biospec Products, USA) at 5000 rpm for 1
min, The solution was then suspended in 0.5 ml of a lysing solution containing archromopeptidase 0.5 mg + lysozyme 0.75 mg/mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0.
The samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Fifty µl
of 10% Tris-SDS solution (SDS in 1 M Tris, w/v) was
added and the solution was well mixed. Samples were
then incubated at 60°C for 5 min. Lysates were then
extracted twice with 0.2 mL of water-saturated phenol and
0.2 mL of chloroform. After centrifugation (15,000 rpm,
10 min) the upper layer was removed and 50 µL of RNase
solution (RNase 1 mg + RNase T1 400 units)/mL of 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 was added. This was kept at 37°C
for 20 min. This was followed by a treatment with 50 µL

amplification
Based on cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences the
two primers for amplification and sequence were; F1 (5'
TAACACATGCAAGTCGAA3'), and newly designed
R4N(5' CCTACCTTAGGCATCCCC 3'). The latter has a
sequence showing high specificity to the family Nostocaceae, which was checked using a BLAST database search
[26]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was
done in a 80 µl reaction mixture using 10–20 ng genomic
DNA, 0.05 units/µl Ampli Taq DNA polymerase, 10 ×
buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and
0.05 µM of primers. The reaction was run in a Techne
Thermal Cycler (Progene, UK) with one cycle of 94°C for
5 min.; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30s, 50°C for 30s, 70°C for
1 min, and finally 72°C for 3 min.

Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences available from
GenBank and those found in the present study were
aligned using CLUSTAL W version 1.6 [27]. This was followed by conversion to a distance matrix. The distance
matrix was converted to a phylogenetic tree using the
neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm of CLUSTAL W version
1.6, with multiple substitutions corrected and positions
with gaps excluded. The seed number for random number
generation and number of bootstrap trials were set to 111
and 1000, respectively.
