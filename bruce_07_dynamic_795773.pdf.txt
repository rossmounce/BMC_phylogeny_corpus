Abstract
Background: Expression profiling of embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation in the presence of
serum has been performed previously. It remains unclear if transcriptional activation is dependent
on complex growth factor mixtures in serum or whether this process is intrinsic to ES cells once
the stem cell program has been inactivated. The aims of this study were to determine the
transcriptional programs associated with the stem cell state and to characterize mesoderm
differentiation between serum and serum-free culture.
Results: ES cells were differentiated as embryoid bodies in 10% FBS or serum-free media
containing BMP4 (2 ng/ml), and expression profiled using 47 K Illumina(R) Sentrix arrays. Statistical
methods were employed to define gene sets characteristic of stem cell, epiblast and primitive
streak programs. Although the initial differentiation profile was similar between the two culture
conditions, cardiac gene expression was inhibited in serum whereas blood gene expression was
enhanced. Also, expression of many members of the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family of transcription
factors changed dramatically during the first few days of differentiation. KLF2 and KLF4 co-localized
with OCT4 in a sub-nuclear compartment of ES cells, dynamic changes in KLF-DNA binding
activities occurred upon differentiation, and strong bio-informatic evidence for direct regulation of
many stem cell genes by KLFs was found.
Conclusion: Down regulation of stem cell genes and activation of epiblast/primitive streak genes
is similar in serum and defined media, but subsequent mesoderm differentiation is strongly
influenced by the composition of the media. In addition, KLF family members are likely to be
important regulators of many stem cell genes.

Background
Embryonic stem (ES) cells isolated from the inner cell
mass of the early mammalian blastocyst-stage embryo
retain pluripotency when cultured on mouse embryonic

fibroblasts (MEFs) in the presence of leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF) [1]. In the absence of LIF and MEF attachment,
ES cells spontaneously differentiate into multi-cellular
aggregates termed embryoid bodies (EBs). Although the

spatial complexity of organogenesis is not established
during EB maturation, the dynamics of gene expression
closely mimic those which characterize early stages of
mouse development [2-5]. Thus, ES cell differentiation is
an excellent model system for the discovery of genes
involved in developmental processes.
Many studies have attempted to identify genes that define
the stem cell state by mining for genes co-expressed in ES
cells and various other stem cell populations such as
hematopoietic and neural stem cells [6,7], or ES cells and
trophoblast stem cells [8]. Some of these studies have
been criticized because they were unable to define a similar cohort of stem cell genes [9]. Also, this approach is
likely to find co-expression of 'housekeeping' genes that
are irrelevant to the stem cell state. More recently,
dynamic expression profiling during ES cell differentiation has been undertaken using various EB culture techniques [10,11] and the addition of exogenous growth
factors [7]. Most of these studies followed differentiation
for a short time period (up to 6–8 days) due to inherent
limitations of liquid or adherent cultures cell differentiation systems.
Various platforms have been used to determine gene
expression profiles, including differential display, SAGE
[12] and slide micro-arrays, such as those provided by
Affymetrix, Agilent and Compugen. In this study we
employed Illumina® Sentrix Mouse-6 oligo bead arrays
[13], which have ~47 K probes that are largely based on
the MEEBO set of transcripts, plus ESTs discovered as part
of the FANTOM2 transcriptome project [14], some alternatively employed exons, and a small subset of non-coding transcripts. This is a new, rich and sensitive platform
for expression profiling [15].
ES cells were differentiated in methylcellulose cultures,
which allowed consistent EB development over 16 days in
either serum [2,16] or defined serum-free media containing BMP4 (2 ng/ml), termed serum-freeB4L hereafter [17].
The dynamics of loss of stem cell gene expression and activation of epiblast and primitive streak gene expression
programs were similar in serum and serum-freeB4L but QT
clustering revealed a significant difference in mesoderm
outcomes from day 6 onwards. In particular, cardiac gene
expression was greater in serum-freeB4L whereas activation
of the blood program was enhanced in serum.
High expression levels of Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family
members: Klf2, Klf4, Klf5 and Klf9 was detected in undifferentiated ES cells, and confirmed by quantitative real
time RT-PCR, indirect immuno-fluorescence and DNAbinding assays. Expression was down regulated rapidly
upon differentiation and a different set of Klfs: Klf3, Klf16
and Klf1/Eklf, were activated upon ES cell differentiation.

Also, KLF-binding sites were markedly over represented in
the proximal promoters of most stem cell specific genes,
suggesting possible direct regulation by KLFs. We suggest
a model in which the balance between self-renewal and
differentiation is regulated by competitive occupancy of
the proximal promoters of key stem cell genes such as
Zfp42/Rex-1, Nanog, Pou5f1(Oct4), Lefty1 and Lefty2, and
others such as the Klf genes themselves.

Results
Differentiation of ES cells in serum and serum-freeB4L
culture
The directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into
desirable cell types will depend upon the addition of specific growth factors to defined media and reproducible
physical conditions of culture. To establish a baseline for
such studies, we undertook a comparison of murine ES
cell differentiation using an embryoid body (EB) methylcellulose culture system containing either 10% FBS [2] or
a chemically defined BSA-based media containing 2 ng/
ml of BMP4, termed serum-freeB4L [17]. Triplicate experiments were performed in which ES cells were harvested
after feeder depletion, and set up in parallel EB cultures in
serum versus serum-freeB4L. RNA was collected at regular
intervals up to 16 days, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a panel of genes representing defined stages of
development to establish the robustness of the culture system (Figure 1), and expression profiling was performed
using Illumina® Sentrix Mouse-6 bead arrays (see Methods
and [13]).

Changes in gene expression were extremely reproducible
across ES differentiation experiments with overall correlation of global gene expression for biological replicates in
the order or 0.95–0.96. Approximately 30% of the probes
were differentially expressed at one or more stages of EB
differentiation as determined by one-way Welch ANOVA
with multiple testing corrections using the Benjamini and
Hochberg False Discovery Rate algorithm (7,967 probes
with a p-value of < 0.01 by Welch t-test) (Figure 2A).
To mine for genes with similar patterns of expression
across the time course, hierarchical clustering was performed on the 7,967 probes and represented graphically.
A large percentage of these (~30%) displayed highest
expression in undifferentiated ES cells and subsequent
reduced expression over time (labeled stem in Figure 2B).
A second major cluster showed marked induction after
~day 4–6 of differentiation (labeled mesoderm in Figure
2B).

stem cell state by comparing expression profiling data

matopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and neural stem cells
[6,18]. We used two alternative approaches to identify
specific stem cell specific gene expression. Firstly, genes
with dynamic expression patterns which correlated
closely with Oct4, Sox2 or Nanog expression profiles (Pearson correlation > 0.9) were determined as previously
described [6,7]. Second, genes rapidly down regulated ≥3
fold by day 3 of differentiation, a time point where ES cell
clonogenicity decreases dramatically, were determined.
Not surprisingly there was very little overlap between
these gene lists, primarily because Oct4 and Nanog expression persists during EB differentiation longer than many
other stem cell genes (Figure 1). Full lists of genes ranked
according to similarity of expression (Pearson correlation
>0.9) with expression patterns for Oct4, Nanog or Sox2 are
provided in Additional files 1, 2, 3, respectively.

development in vivo, with transcripts detected in the epiblast and later in the primitive streak, before it becomes
further restricted to primordial germ cells [10,28]. 779
genes with a similar pattern of expression to Oct4 (Pearson correlation of > 0.9) were identified (Additional file
1). As expected this list also includes many well known
stem cell genes such as Sal-like 1, nodal, chromobox
homolog 7 (Cbx7), Dnmt3b and Sprouty homolog 4 [19].
We also mined for stem cell genes by looking for similarity (Pearson correlation of > 0.9) with Nanog and Sox2
gene expression profiles. These provided overlapping but
not identical sets of putative stem cell specific genes
(Additional files 2, 3). Full data for the 16 days of differentiation can be interrogated and mined for specific differentiation outcomes via Signet (Login_Bruce) (see
Methods).

Only fifty-nine genes were down regulated ≥3 fold by day
3 of EB differentiation (Table 1). Many of these have been
identified as stem cell markers by other groups using alternative strategies [6,7,19]. Information was compiled on
their known expression patterns and/or gene knockout
phenotypes via literature searches as referenced in Table 1.
Insufficient space exists to discuss every gene and most
have been previously identified as ES cell enriched transcripts. Osteopontin is secreted by osteoblasts in the bone
marrow niche where it is thought to play an important
role in the maintenance of HSC quiescence and maintenance of 'stemness' [20]. It has also been discovered by
other groups as a strong marker of ES cells and is regulated
directly by the key stem cell transcription factors, Oct4
and Sox2 [21]. Thus, osteopontin is likely to be a useful
marker of ES cell pluripotency and may play autocrine or
paracrine roles in maintenance of stemness. The second
most rapidly down regulated gene was estrogen related
receptor β, Esrrb, which had previously been identified as
a stem cell specific gene and shown to be critical for maintenance of the stem cell state [19]. F-box 15 (Fbxo15), a
member of the large F-box family of genes [22] was also
rapidly down regulated. Fbxo15 is known to be highly
expressed in ES cells, is regulated by Oct4 and Sox2, but is
dispensable for ES cell self-renewal [23]. Recently, the
stem cell specificity of this locus was used to screen for
cDNAs capable of transforming mouse fibroblasts into ES
cell populations [24]. Other notable rapidly down regulated genes included the nodal inhibitors Lefty-1 and
Lefty-2, and Zfp42/Rex-1, which are also well established
as stem cell markers [19].

Tightly co-ordinated waves of gene expression suggest
sequential activation of epiblast, primitive streak and
mesoderm differentiation programs
Many alternative differentiation programs occur simultaneously during ES cell differentiation. Therefore, it is difficult to find gene syn-expression patterns that identify
specific programs using standard clustering methods. An
alternative approach is to search for expression patterns
that closely resemble genes of known function. For example, the T box gene, brachyury, is a well characterized specific marker of the primitive streak [29]. Brachyury
expression is transient in vivo, a feature recapitulated during ES cell differentiation [2]. Using qRT-PCR, brachyury
was induced ~1000 fold from D0 to day 4 and then rapidly silenced to baseline levels by D6 (Figure 1). The
dynamics of brachyury expression were similar between
serum and serum-freeB4L media (Figure 1 and 3A), but
serum-free media was unable to support brachyury induction in the absence of BMP-4 (data not shown). Thus,
BMP4 (or related factors in serum such as activin) is essential for mesoderm generation. Thirty genes were identified
with a similar expression pattern to brachyury (Pearson
correlation >0.9) (Table 2) including many genes with
established expression or critical functions during primitive streak formation, such as Mix1 [30], Lim1 [31], Sp5
[32] and eomesodermin [33]. Transient expression of many
of these 'streak-specific' genes was validated by qRT-PCR
(Figure 3B and data not shown). In all cases there was a
close correlation between the qRT-PCR results and the
profiling data (Figure 3A).

Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 are not included in Table 1, even
though each is required for the maintenance of ES cell
pluripotency [25-27] due to their persistent expression
during the first 3 days of EB differentiation (Figure 1 and
5A, and Additional file 1). Indeed, Oct4 expression is
known to persist beyond the inner cell mass stage of

Interestingly, four novel transcripts were identified in this
list (Table 2). One of these, 8430415E04Rik, was detected
by two independent probes, strongly supporting its
'streak-specific' expression; by qRT-PCR there was ~50
fold induction from day 2 to day 3 of differentiation and
a decrease to near baseline levels by day 6 (Figure 3B). The
gene contains 24 exons, and the full length cDNA encodes

for a protein of 868 amino acids (Figure 3D) which is
highly conserved in vertebrates (Additional file 4). It has
little homology to other proteins apart from three predicted HEAT domains or armadillo domains (grey shading
in Figure 3D). Drosophila armadillo interacts with β-catenin via its HEAT/armadillo repeat [34], which suggests
the protein encoded by 8430415E04Rik may also be
involved in protein-protein interactions.
The list of primitive streak genes in table 2 is smaller than
that previously published [10] due to the very stringent
criteria used to determine brachyury-like patterns of
expression. Thus, to find further genes characteristic of
epiblast, early and late primitive streak programs, probes
were identified which were transiently up and down regulated at least two fold with peak expression at day 2, 3 or
4 of EB differentiation. Gene lists were combined (102
Illumina probes) and clustered into epiblast, early, mid
and late streak groups plus a unique group in which
expression was very transient at day 3 of differentiation

(designated 'brief' at the bottom of Figure 3C). Also, lists
were generated by searching for similarity of dynamic
expression profiles to known genes which are accepted
specific markers of specific stages of mouse development.
For example, Fgf5 is specifically expressed in the epiblast
[35], and Wnt5a is expressed in the late primitive streak
[36]. The Fgf5-like (epiblast) list includes the methyltransferase, Dnmt3b, which was massively up-regulated in the
first 2 days of EB differentiation (Additional file 5) and is
known to be essential for mesoderm differentiation [37].
This list also includes Pim2, Zic2, Wnt8a, the SP1 (and
possibly SP5) cofactor Crsp2, and Irf1. The Wnt5a-like
(late primitive streak) list contains 76 genes including
many homeobox genes (Hoxb2, Hoxd1, Hoxb6 and Hox8/
Msx2), Cdx2, Hand1, Tbx3, Bmp4 and the VEGF receptor
Flt1 (Additional file 6). Many are expressed at E10 of
mouse development in the remnants of the primitive
streak [36], suggesting the Wnt5a-like list includes many
genes known to pattern the embryo following formation
of the germ layers. There is a significant overlap between

* More than one independent illumina probe for these genes were identified

the genes we identified as being epiblast-, early and late
streak-specific and those recently identified using a similar
EB differentiation system and Affymetrix arrays [10], and
by other groups [2,38]. In addition, there are addition
novel RIKEN cDNAs in these lists, which are likely to
encode for interesting proteins worthy of further study
(Additional files 5, 6).
Following the primitive streak wave of gene expression
there was a dramatic activation of many genes (Figure 2A).
Many of the most highly induced genes, such as globin
genes, heme synthesis enzymes and haematopoietic transcription factors, are known to be expressed in the blood.
qRT-PCR for globin genes confirmed > 10,000 fold induction between days 3 and 8 with a steady decline thereafter
(Figure 1). Other mesoderm and endoderm programs are
also activated at this stage, so it is difficult to mine for
these different outcomes.

Enhanced cardiac gene expression and reduced
erythropoiesis in serum-freeB4L EB culture
Overall there were very strong similarities between ES cell
differentiation in serum and serum-free cultures supplemented with 2 ng/ml BMP4. For example, all 29 of the
primitive streak gene set, as defined from serum-containing cultures, were also expressed transiently and to a similar level in serum-freeB4L media (Figure 3A). Genes
differentially expressed at each EB time point (Day 1–16)
were pooled and subjected to QT clustering to find sets
differentially expressed between serum and serum-freeB4L
EB culture. Using a minimal cut-off of five genes per
group, nine gene sets were identified; seven showed
higher expression in serum and two showed higher
expression in serum-freeB4L (Table 3 and Figure 4).

The genes in set 9 were expressed more highly in serumfreeB4L media from day 6, and genes in set 8 showed up-

regulation at day 12 and 16 in the absence of serum (Figure 4). Both sets are comprised almost exclusively of cardiac-specific genes such as myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7),
myosin light chain 7 (Myl7), the cardiac isoform of αactin (Actc1), troponin (Tnnc2), tropomysin (Tpm2), the
nicotinic cholinergic receptor (Chrng), and cardiac muscle
fast twitch 1 specific ATPase (Atp2a1) (Table 3). Further
interrogation of the array data revealed a cohort of cardiac
transcription factors, including ISL1, MEF2C, Bop/Smyd1
and Hand2 [39], which were transiently up regulated 1.4
to 3.5 fold in serum-freeB4L media compared to serum at
day 6 (Signet Login_Bruce). Importantly, this elevated cardiac gene expression program correlated with increased
numbers of spontaneously beating EBs in serum-freeB4L
media (data not shown). Enhanced expression (~100
fold) of Actc1, Myl4 and Myl7 in serum-freeB4L media compared with serum-containing media was confirmed by
qRT-PCR (Figure 1). Taken together, this data strongly
suggests cardiac muscle cell differentiation is either inhibited in serum or enhanced by the addition of BMP4 to
serum-free culture.
The genes in set 2 were expressed in both serum and
serum-freeB4L conditions immediately following primitive
streak formation, but expressed to higher levels and
slightly earlier in serum (Table 3 and Figure 4). Many of
these genes are globins (both embryonic and definitive)
suggesting erythropoiesis is activated more robustly in the
presence of serum (See Discussion). Alas2, a gene encoding the erythroid specific isoform of the first and rate limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway, and the
erythroid specific transcription factor, p45-NF-E2 are also
in set 2 [40]. qRT-PCR for α- and βh1-globin confirmed
more rapid expression in serum versus SFB4L media (Figure 1), suggesting factors in addition to BMP4 enhance
activation of the blood program from a similar primitive
streak platform.
The genes in set 3 were expressed at a similar time in
serum but expressed at very low levels or not at all in
serum-freeB4L media. Again, this set is highly enriched for
erythroid specific genes such as alpha hemoglobin stabilising protein (Ahsp) [41], Glycophorin A, erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF/Klf1) [42] and mitochondrial solute
carrier protein (mitoferrin) [43] (Figure 4 and Table 3).
Genes in sets 1 and 5 are activated more robustly at late
time points in serum cultures. Most of these are specifically expressed in macrophages. Together, these results
suggest delayed and less robust primitive haematopoiesis
occurs in SFB4L culture compared with serum, an observation confirmed by less robust erythroid cell generation
and 'redness' of the EBs from day 6–10 of differentiation
(data not shown).

Rapid changes in Kruppel-like factor gene expression upon
ES cell differentiation
Three Kruppel-like factor genes, Klf2, Klf4 and Klf5, were
rapidly down regulated during the first few days of EB
development (bold type in Table 1). All are members of
the KLF family of transcription factors which are characterized by a similar C-terminal domain of three C2H2 zinc
fingers which confers binding to CACC box elements in
promoters and more distant regulatory elements [44,45].
Klf2 and Klf4 have N-terminal transcriptional action
domains and act primarily as transcriptional activators,
whereas Klf5 is best known as a transcriptional repressor
[46]. Until recently, Klf2 and Klf4 were considered to have
restricted expression patterns [47,48] with gene knockout
animals showing late developmental defects in vasculogenesis and skin differentiation, respectively [49,50].
Recently however, Klf4 expression was noted in ES cells
[19,51], and forced expression was shown to enhance
Oct4 expression and promote self-renewal [51].

qRT-PCR confirmed the rapid down regulation of Klf2,
Klf4 and Klf5 in both serum and serum-freeB4L differentiation conditions, although Klf5 expression was down regulated more slowly (Figure 5A and 5B, and Table 4). Klf2,
Klf4 and Klf5 were all re-induced from day 3–5 of differentiation as mesoderm and endoderm developmental
pathways are activated (Figure 5A and 5B). Sixteen of the
17 known KLFs were examined in detail throughout the
entire differentiation time course (Table 4). Klf9 was also
steadily down regulated (>10 fold) between ES cells and
day 5 EBs in serum and serum-freeB4L media (Figure 5B).
Klf3, a well characterized transcriptional repressor [52] via
its ability to recruit the co-repressor, CtBP [53], displayed
an interesting biphasic expression pattern with initial
rapid down regulation then re-induction from days 5–6
(Figure 5B). In contrast, Klf16 displayed little change in
expression levels over the 16 days of EB maturation (Figure 5B).
Klf2 and Klf4 co-localize with OCT4 in the nuclei of ES
cells (Figure 6A). Interestingly, all three proteins were
found to preferentially reside in a nuclear sub-compartment (possibly nucleoli for transcription factories), suggesting possible co-involvement in a protein complex or
network. Also, endogenous KLF2 was detected by specific
CACC box DNA-binding activity in undifferentiated ES
cells, which was lost upon EB differentiation (Figure 6B).
In contrast, endogenous ES cell KLF4 DNA binding activity was not detected using the p18INK4c promoter CACC
box sequence, although recombinant KLF4 was shown to
bind to this probe (data not shown). SP1 and SP3 are
ubiquitously expressed CACC-box binding proteins,
which are dominant in ES cell nuclear extracts (Figure 6B).
We hypothesize KLF2, KLF3, KLF4, KLF5 and KLF6 compete with SP1 family members for DNA binding to key cis

elements in various stem cell genes to regulate expression
in positive and negative fashions (see Discussion).
Enrichment of KLF-binding cis elements in the proximal
promoters of stem cell specific genes
To investigate whether Kruppel-like factors might directly
regulate stem cell gene expression, and therefore play a
role in the maintenance or loss of 'stemness', the presence
of KLF transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within the
proximal promoters of all genes in Table 1 was determined. Although a position weighted matrix (PWM) for
KLF4 binding site specificity has been published [54], this
site does not resemble the CACC box sequences known to
bind other KLFs. Since KLF4 has identical DNA-binding
residues in each of its three C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers
to other members of the Kruppel-like factor family [45], it
should bind to similar sequences. Based on the crystal
structure of the zinc fingers of Zif268 and SP1 bound to
DNA [55,56], and testing of specific binding of CACC box
variants to recombinant KLF1, KLF3 and KLF17
[45,52,57,58], a generic KLF TFBS has been proposed.
Although a SELEX experiment for KLF1 binding has not
been published, experiments from our group suggest a C
at position 1, an A or C at position 3, an A at position 5,
and an A, T or C at position 9 of the 9 bp consensus provides enhanced affinity for KLF1 binding. Taken together,
these studies have enabled the development of a PWM
(called here KLF-A) that should predict KLF4, KLF2 and
other KLF TFBSs (see Methods and Additional file 7).

Clover [59] was used to determine if defined TFBSs were
statistically over-represented in the stem cell lists. We
searched for PWMs for KLF-A, KLF4 [54], octamer,
extended octamer, nanog, and Oct-Sox binary sites as well
as negative control sites (gata-1 and E-box) in sequences 2
kb upstream of the TSSs of stem cell genes (Table 1), versus 2 kb of sequences upstream of the entire murine transcriptome (See Additional file 7 for details of PWMs).
There was significant over-representation of KLF-A TFBS
within the first 2 kb of promoter sequences from the stem
list gene list (p value of < 0.01) (Figure 7A), as well as
over-representation of octamer sites and extended Oct4binding sites as defined from ChIP-PET data [60]. No statistically significant over-representation of KLF4 [54],
NANOG, GATA1 or E-box TFBSs were identified. All genes
in the rapidly down regulated gene list have at least one
KLF-A type CACC site, or octamer or Oct4 [60] TFBS. A
full list of the promoters with highlighted sites is available
on request. Together, this data strongly suggests direct
transcriptional regulation of many stem cell genes by
KLFs.
The Zfp42/Rex1 gene promoter is presented as an example
of output from the Clover program (Figure 7B). It contains five KLF-A, one octamer and three OCT4 TFBS. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/365

two CACC box elements within the first 250 base pairs of
the TSS represent classical extended KLF-binding sites
[42,61]. These regions are the same as previously reported
[62] although their functional importance has not been
determined. Interestingly, two of the three KLF-A TFBS
were evolutionarily conserved between the mouse and rat
gene promoters (Figure 7C). Also, two further conserved
CACC sites at -1.4 and -1.5 kb were identified within 500
bp of extended evolutionary conservation (>70% identity) (Figure 7C). This might act as a KLF dependent
enhancer. Most of the stem cell genes in list 1 have conserved CACC box elements in their promoters [63-66]. In
some cases these have been reported to bind the ubiquitous SP1, but our Clover analysis suggests they are also
likely to bind KLFs (see Discussion).

Discussion
Expression profiling of murine ES cell differentiation was
undertaken over a 16-day time course. We compared gene
expression in methylcellulose cultures containing serum
versus chemically defined media containing LIF (1 U/ml)
and low concentrations of BMP4 (2 ng/ml) [67]. The Illumina® Sentrix Mouse 6 bead array provided a sensitive and
detailed platform for analysis of dynamic gene expression.
Using various data mining approaches, lists of stem cellenriched genes and genes that are induced during the in
vitro equivalent of epiblast and primitive streak stages of
differentiation were generated. In combination with other
ES cell profiling studies [7], our detailed expression data
provides a useful resource for future reverse genetic
approaches (i.e. siRNA knockdown) to study the function
of these genes during ES cell differentiation and in vivo
development. We also found a number of previously
uncharacterized cDNAs (RIKEN clones) which could play
important roles during development.
Importantly, the loss of pluripotency, measured by Oct4
gene expression, was comparable between serum and
serum-freeB4L EB culture, following a predicted decrease
over the first 6 days. Surprisingly, Oct4 gene expression
gradually increased following day 6, an observation independent of the cell lines used (data not shown). It remains
undetermined if expansion of Oct4 positive ES cells persists as undifferentiated populations within our EB culture
system. Previous studies have identified the development
of Oct4 positive primordial germ cells (PGC) following
12 days of ES cell differentiation [68-70], suggesting the
Oct4 profile may alternatively represent the expansion of
non-ES cell populations. Although the expansion of some
undifferentiated ES cells is possible, the array profile does
not suggest global persistence or up-regulation of ES gene
expression late in the EB program. Also, markers of mesoderm induction such as brachyury and Mixl, do not show
persistent up-regulation following peak expression at day
4, suggesting EBs are unlikely to harbour cells which are

delayed or arrested from entering the differentiation program.
We found significant differences in cardiac gene expression during EB differentiation in serum and serum-freeB4L
culture. Our current understanding of cardiac development provides possible insights into this observation.
Briefly, in vivo studies have revealed BMPs secreted from
the anterior lateral plate, and ill-defined signals from
anterior primitive endoderm, are key inducers of cardiac
development [71-73]. The administration of recombinant
BMP2 or BMP4 to chick explant cultures induces cardiac

differentiation in non-cardiogenic mesoderm [71] and
Bmp2 knockout animals develop cardiac abnormalities
[74]. Conversely, Wnts secreted by the neural tube are
strong suppressors of cardiogenesis. Together, these
opposing signals act to establish the borders of the heart
field [71,75]. By mimicking the environment that establishes cardiogenesis in vivo, assays capable of directing cardiomyocyte production from ES cells have been
established. BMPs can efficiently enhance the cardiac program when added to EB culture [76,77], whereas BMP
inhibition drastically suppresses this outcome. In our
hands cultures supplemented with BMP4 (2 ng/ml) sup-

ported cardiomyocyte maturation (as determined by
expression of cardiac specific genes) with greatest expression detected at Day 8–10. This correlated with increased
numbers of spontaneously beating EBs, and the timing of
initial spontaneous contractions during murine embryogenesis [78]. The cardiac program was significantly
reduced in culture containing 10% serum, an observation
supported by a number of other studies [79,80]. This suggests the constituents of serum are inhibitory to cardiomyocyte development. Although a detailed assessment of
cardiomyocyte differentiation was not the focus of this
analysis, the array output, qRT-PCR profiles and morphological observations described supports the usefulness of
this assay in future investigations. In addition, the defined
constituents of serum-freeB4L media provides an excellent
opportunity to identify additional recombinant factors
required to further expand cardiac progenitor cell production from EBs.
In contrast, the hematopoietic program was more pronounced within EBs grown in 10% serum than BMP4
alone (Figure 1 and 4). In particular, EKLF (Klf1) expression was significantly reduced in serum-free media supplemented with BMP4 (2 ng/ml) compared with serum
(Figure 5A and Table 4). EKLF is essential for regulation of
a large cohort of erythroid specific genes [81,82], many of
which were identified in sets 2 and 3 (Figure 4). Thus, it is
likely that reduced EKLF expression in SFB4L media directly
results in inhibition of a cascade of erythroid gene expression. Previous work showed the addition of BMP (at 5 ng/
ml) to serum-free ES cell culture induces EKLF expression
and restores hematopoietic cell differentiation [83].
Although a weak hematopoietic program was observed in
SFB4L culture, the concentration of BMP4 used was less
than that used by Adelman et al. Thus, we suggest a robust
cardiac (anterior-ventral mesoderm) gene expression program is induced by low conentrations of BMP4 (or other
BMPs), whereas a robust blood gene expression program
(posterior-ventral mesoderm) requires >2 ng/ml of BMP4
or additional growth factors. Recently, mesoderm derived
progenitor cell populations for hematopoietic and cardiac
lineages were studied during EB development using ES
cells in which GFP is targeted to the brachyury locus [80].
Within day 3.25 EBs, GFP+Flk1+ cells were shown to represent hematopoietic precursors, whereas GFP+Flk1- cells
were significantly enriched for cardiac progenitor populations. It would be interesting to determine if the ratio of
Flk1+/Flk1- within the brachyury positive population is
altered between our two culture conditions.
A number of the Kruppel-like factor family of transcription factors were dynamically expressed in the first few
days of ES cell differentiation. It was initially surprising to
find highly enriched Klf2 and Klf4 expression in ES cells,
since both are considered markers of terminally differen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/365

tiated cell types such as skin [50], gut [84], vascular
smooth muscle [49,85] and lymphocytes [86]. However,
recent evidence suggests KLFs may regulate stem cell function, since Klf4 is enriched in ES cells [19] and forced overexpression within these cells can maintain pluripotency in
the absence of LIF [51]. Furthermore, Klf4 can bind the
Lefty1 gene core promoter co-operatively with Oct4 and
Sox2 [65]. Although Lefty 1 and 2 are best characterized as
repressors of nodal, acting to regulate left-right patterning
[87], our results and those of others, suggest a possible
redundant role for lefty proteins during the maintenance
of ES cell pluripotency [65]. Similarly to the Oct4 expression profile, many of the KLF family members also
increased in expression late in the differentiation program. As mentioned, the KLFs are expressed in diverse tissues during development. It is therefore expected that the
profiles obtained reflect the generation and early specification of mesoderm and endoderm cells following primitive streak gene activation at day 4.
Based on the likely identical binding specificity of the KLF
family, established transcriptional activation and repression roles of certain family members [44], and bioinformatic evidence of a high prevalence of KLF TFBSs in many
stem cell genes, we propose KLF competition for occupancy of these CACC box elements might determine selfrenewal versus differentiation of ES cells. According to this
model, high levels of KLF2 and KLF4 expression in undifferentiated ES cells would lead to occupancy of CACC box
elements in promoters of stem cell genes such as Pou5f1/
Oct4, Nanog, Esrrb, Zfp42/Rex1, Lefty1 and Lefty2. Furthermore, the Klf2 and Klf4 genes themselves have CACC box
elements in their proximal promoters (Figure 7A), suggesting a positive feedback loop within ES cells is likely.
Interestingly, gene knockout and lentiviral shRNA gene
knockdown of Klf2 or Klf4, does not lead to an obvious
stem cell defect [19,49,50,85], suggesting these two KLFs
may have functionally redundant roles during the maintenance of pluripotency. Future analysis of KLF2/KLF4 double knockout ES lines or the knockdown of both proteins
using RNAi technologies will be necessary to validate this
hypothesis. Upon ES cell differentiation, down regulation
of Klf2 and Klf4 was very rapid, whereas down regulation
of Oct4 and Nanog was delayed for one to two days. We
suggest loss of KLF2 and KLF4 binding to Pouf1/Oct4,
Nanog, Esrrb and perhaps other stem cell promoters, could
be directly responsible for their down regulation. Moreover, Klf5 was down regulated more slowly, and Klf3 was
up-regulated in the first two days of differentiation, suggesting these KLFs may function primarily as transcriptional repressors at the Pouf1/Oct4, nanog, Zfp42 and Esrrb
gene promoters. Once this differentiation driving transcription network is activated we suggest KLF3, KLF5 and
KLF9 can accelerate loss of the stem cell state by directly
repressing expression of the Klf2 and Klf4 genes them-

selves. Therefore, a combination of cross regulation of
transcriptional outputs, and competition for occupancy of
key stem cell promoters by KLF proteins with differing
biochemical properties but identical DNA-binding capacities, may determine self-renewal versus differentiation
outcomes. Again validation of this model requires functional analysis. It is important to note we have not proven
occupancy of stem cell gene promoters by the KLFs in vivo.
Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) experiments in
ES cells and differentiated populations are essential to validate this model, however ChiP grade antibodies are not
currently available.

derm derived cardiac and haematopoietic transcripts.
These results support the use of defined serum-free
approaches for the directed differentiation of ES cell commitment. Expression of many KLF family members were
enriched in ES cells and rapidly down regulated upon differentiation. KLF2 and KLF4 were co-localisation with
OCT4 in ES cell nuclei and KLF transcription factor binding sites were over-represented within the promoters of
the putative ES cell gene list (p < 0.01). Taken together,
this data strongly suggests KLF family members regulate
the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency.

Methods
This scenario is not necessarily limited to ES cell differentiation. A similar program may take place in many adult
stem and progenitor cells populations. Certainly competition between Klf4 and Klf5 has been suggested to regulate
cell growth [88], and Klf1 and Klf3 compete for binding
and have opposing effects in blood cells [89]. Furthermore, an imbalance between occupancy of key stem cell
or proliferation gene promoters by KLFs, with differing
activating and repressing functions, could be responsible
for the development or progression of many common
forms of cancer. For example, loss of hetero-zygosity for
Klf4 and Klf5 has been found in colon, stomach, breast,
prostate and liver cancers [90,91].

Conclusion

ES cell culture, embryoid body formation and
immunohistochemistry
W9.5 ES cell differentiation was performed as described
(Bruce et al., Differentiation, in press). For immuno-fluorescence, feeder depleted W9.5 ES cells were seeded onto
sterile gelatin-coated glass cover slips in ES cell media,
fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min then washed in PBS. Cover
slips were boiled in 10 mM citric acid (pH 6.4) for 10 min,
washed in PBS and permeabilized in 0.18% triton X-100
in PBS for 10 mins. For OCT4/KLF4 detection, the cover
slips were blocked in 1% BSA then incubated with rabbit
polyclonal antibody raised against OCT4 (Abcam
#ab19857) and goat Anti-mouse KLF4 (R&D Systems
#AF3158) overnight at 4°C, then incubated in goat antirabbit Alexa-488 (1:400) (Molecular Probes #A11008)
and donkey anti-goat Alexa-647 (1:400) for 1 hour. For
co-detection of OCT4/KLF2, the Zenon Rabbit IgG labelling kit was used (Molecular Probes #Z-25308). 1 μg of
KLF2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz SC-28675)
was labeled with Alexa647 Fab fragment following the
manufacturer's instructions. Cover slips already stained
for OCT4 (Alexa488) were incubated with labeled KLF2
for 1 hr then washed and post-fixed in 4% PFA to ensure
strong signal detection. DAPI 1:5000 (Molecular Probes
#D3571) was used to detect nuclear localization. Cover
slips were mounted on SuperFrost® Plus slides (MenzelGlaser) with VectaShield mounting media (Vector Laboratories H-1000). Confocal microscopy was performed on
LSM 510 META Carl Zeiss microscope system.

Defining the genetic regulation of ES cell self renewal and
differentiation will be instrumental for the development
of future cell based therapies. Using 47 K Illumina® Sentrix
bead arrays, the differential expression of genes during 16
days of ES cell differentiation was determined. Hierarchical gene clustering and correlation statistical analyses lead
to the identification of a small cohort of genes which
define the stem cell state. Historically, ES cell differentiation is achieved in culture media containing 10–15% FBS.
A direct comparison between ES cell differentiation in
serum and a serum-free media was undertaken. Surprisingly, global gene expression profiles were comparable
between culture conditions, with the exception of meso-

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and real-time RT-PCR
data analysis
Total RNA was made using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and
cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of DNase1-treated total
RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and oligo-DT12–15
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using the
Applied Biosystems SYBR-green dye system and 7500 Real
Time Cycler in 96-well plates. Cycling variables were as
follows: 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes, then
40 cycles of 15-second denaturation at 95°C and 1minute at appropriate annealing temperatures, optimized

In addition to the proposed complex transcriptional interplay between KLFs and stem cell gene promoters, direct
protein-protein interactions and protein networks involving KLFs are possible. We showed sub-nuclear localization
of KLF2 and KLF4 with OCT4 in ES cells (Figure 6A), and
KLF4 can co-operate with OCT4 and SOX2 to drive expression of the Lefty1 core promoter [65]. Also, very recent
biochemical purification of NANOG-interacting proteins
discovered KLF4 as part of a NANOG-OCT4 network in ES
cells (Stuart Orkin, personal communication). This is also
consistent with the ability of KLF4 to co-operate with
OCT4, SOX2 and c-MYC to drive de-differentiation of
fibroblasts into ES-like cells [24].

for each set of primers based on dissociation curves (Additional file 8). Expression levels were normalized to HPRT
as determined from the ratio of delta CT values. Mean of
relative expression ± SD was determined from three biological replicates. Sequencing of gel-purified amplicons
was performed to ensure correct product amplification.
Micro-array hybridization and analysis
Expression profiling was performed using Sentrix Mouse6 Expression BeadChip arrays from Illumina®. RNA was
assessed for integrity using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100
and RNA integrity (RIN) scores above 9.5 were present in
all samples. Amplification was performed with 500 ng of
total RNA using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Ambion) with a 12 hour in vitro transcription
reaction period. The quantity and quality of biotin-UTP
incorporated cRNA was also assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Amplified cRNA (1500 ng per array) was
hybridized to Mouse-6.v1 BeadChip arrays according to
the manufacturer guidelines and detected with Fluorolink
Streptavidin-Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences). Arrays were
scanned using the Illumina BeadStation Scanner. The raw
intensity values obtained for the scanned array images
were compiled using the proprietary BeadStudio v1.5.1.3
software and imported into GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 (Agilent). A mouse Illumina probe set was defined in the
GeneSpring Workgroup using the Illumina targetIDs as
the unique identifiers and annotated according to array
content files supplied by illumina®. Data normalization
was performed by first setting all measurements less than
0.01 to 0.01, then applying per chip normalization to the
50th percentile, and per gene normalization to the
median.

From an interpretation which included the three FBS
experiments, a non-parametric Welch ANOVA (where variances were not assumed equal) was performed on all
46,120 probes to find a subset of genes whose expression
varied significantly throughout the differentiation time
course. A Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate
multiple testing correction was applied to reduce the
number of false positives. This yielded a set of 7,967
probes that showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in expression by Welch t-test. This approach simplified running the data mining algorithms to find synexpression patterns by removing genes such as housekeeping genes which did not display differential expression, or
genes which did not reach a threshold of expression at any
time points.
Genome interpretations were generated in GeneSpring
GXv7.3.1 (Agilent) in which the mean relative expression
level for each gene was represented at each time point relative to the average of all time points. A number of statistical approaches were used to find syn-expression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/365

patterns. A Pearson correlation (between 0.9 and 1.0) was
performed to find genes with similar expression profiles
to Pouf1/Oct4, nanog, sox2, fgf5, wnt5 and brachyury. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the gene by gene
and group by group 'tree' algorithm within the GeneSpring (Agilent) program. This compares each probe with
every other in the lists to generate similarity statistics and
a tree representation of similarity based on a Pearson correlation. Also, quality threshold (QT) clustering [92] was
used to define distinct subsets of co-expressed genes. The
entire data set for the experiments is available via GEO as
well as via our instance of Genespring (contact corresponding author).
Electro-mobility gel shift assays (EMSA)
Nuclear extracts were made from undifferentiated ES cells
and embryoid bodies grown for four days in 10% serum.
Electromobility gel shift assays (EMSA) were performed as
previously described [61] using double stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to an extended CACC site
in the p18INK4c promoter (sense strand 5'-gttgggcggggcgtgggcggggcc-3') (Tallack, et al., submitted). Supershifts were performed with specific antibodies raised
against SP1 (Santa Cruz SC-059x), SP3 (Santa Cruz SC644x), KLF2 (Santa Cruz SC-28675), KLF3 [52] and KLF4
(Santa Cruz SC-12538x).
Bioinformatic searches for CACC sites and other over
represented elements in promoters of stem cell genes
The data-mining tool Biomart (accessed via Ensembl
release 36 of the mouse genome), was used to collate 2 kb
of sequences upstream of the transcriptional start sites
(TSSs) of all genes listed in Table 1. The Clover program,
run via the MotifViz web interface [59], was used to search
for over-representation of position weighted matrices
(PWMs) for octamer [93], Oct4 [60], Oct-Sox [60], KLF4
[54], E-box, GATA-1 [94] and CACC (KLF-A) elements in
these promoter sets. The PWMs are listed in Additional
file 7. The ECR Browser [95] was used to determine phylogenetic conservation of cis elements between mouse, rat
and human genomes.
