Abstract
Bacteria are simple and cost effective hosts for producing recombinant proteins. However, their
physiological features may limit their use for obtaining in native form proteins of some specific
structural classes, such as for instance polypeptides that undergo extensive post-translational
modifications. To some extent, also the production of proteins that depending on disulfide bridges
for their stability has been considered difficult in E. coli.
Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms keep their cytoplasm reduced and, consequently,
disulfide bond formation is impaired in this subcellular compartment. Disulfide bridges can stabilize
protein structure and are often present in high abundance in secreted proteins. In eukaryotic cells
such bonds are formed in the oxidizing environment of endoplasmic reticulum during the export
process. Bacteria do not possess a similar specialized subcellular compartment, but they have both
export systems and enzymatic activities aimed at the formation and at the quality control of
disulfide bonds in the oxidizing periplasm.
This article reviews the available strategies for exploiting the physiological mechanisms of bactera
to produce properly folded disulfide-bonded proteins.

Background
The success of recombinant protein expression in E. coli
depends mainly on the capability of avoiding unproductive interactions of newly expressed polypeptides. Such
interactions lead to aggregation of folding intermediates
instead of yielding native proteins. The efficiency of the
process can be increased by favoring conditions that stabilize folding intermediates and promote the formation of
mature structure. Several strategies may help in preventing
protein aggregation by masking hydrophobic patches on
their external surfaces. These include the introduction of
chaperone molecules, adding detergents, or co-expressing
interacting sub-units of larger complexes. Once the conditions have been optimized for keeping the folding intermediates monodispersed, it becomes crucial to speed up

the folding process to reach stable native structures and
avoid the accumulation of metastable configurations that
remain potentially prone to aggregation. Foldases and isomerases may strongly enhance the folding (Fig 1).
The attention of this review will be focused on the technically available solutions to improve the bacterial expression of proteins that rely on disulfide bond formation to
reach their native state. Such cys-cys bridges block folding
units into stable conformations by linking residues in a
covalent manner and their formation is necessary for a
protein to achieve its stable tertiary structure.

Alternative strategies consider promoting the formation

cytoplasm to reach a mild oxidative environment (Figure

improving the yields of functional target proteins.

Unfolded proteins can be translocated into the periplasm
post-translationally (Sec mechanism) or co-translationally
(SPR mechanism), according to their specific leader
sequences. SecB is the physiological chaperone involved in
stabilizing unfolded proteins bound to Sec translocation
machinery, but the activity of other cytoplasmic chaperones
like DnaK can be beneficial. Once in the periplasm proteins
folding is mediated by the Dsb oxidases/isomerases, by chaperones such as Skp, DegP and FkpA, and by peptidyl-prolyl
isomerases such as SurA, PpiA, and PpiB. Double mutant
strains, in which the thioredoxin/glutaredoxin reductase
(trxB-, gor-) pathway is silenced, are characterized by the
presence of an oxidizing cytoplasm, compatible with the folding of proteins that need disulfide bridges for stabilizing their
structure. Cytoplasmic accumulation of correctly folded
disulfide-dependent proteins is improved by disulfide isomerase DsbC co-expression and cytoplasmic chaperone
(DnaKJE, GroELS, ClpB). Finally, proteins provided with a
Tat export leader sequence first fold in the cytoplasm and
then are tanslocated into the periplasm. Chaperones like
DnaKJE, can stabilize the precursor in the cytoplasm and
chaperones such as SlyD and TorD support the pathway efficiency probably binding to the export leader peptide.

Finally, protein aggregates can be first dissolved in chaotropic solutions to reach monodispersity and later be used
as a starting material for oxidative refolding processes. A
flowchart of the different alternatives is reported in Figure
2.

Periplasmic expression
The most intuitive method to exploit E. coli for recovering
folded disulfide-bond dependent recombinant proteins is
to direct the translated polypeptides to the bacterial periplasm. There are clear physiological reasons for such an
approach: the periplasm, in contrast to the cytoplasm, is
an oxidizing compartment and it hosts enzymes catalyzing disulfide bond formation and their isomerization, as
well as specific chaperones and foldases [1-3]. However,
the necessity of translocating nascent polypeptides
through the inner membrane introduces a delicate step
since there is only a limited number of available gates for

ment. In eukaryotic cells, the oxidative environment in
which disulfide bonds are preferentially formed is the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, polypeptides
expressed in the reducing cytoplasm need to be directed to
ER to complete their folding. The correct targeting to the
subcellular compartment is mediated by signal peptides
fused to the protein amino terminus that are removed
after the import into the organelle. Prokaryotes share with
eukaryotic cells the reducing cytoplasm, but do not have
structures resembling the ER. Instead of it, they possess an
oxidizing periplasm to which pro-peptides with an extra
N-term export peptide can be translocated. Therefore,
eukaryotic protein expression in bacteria periplasm is possible following the substitution of the ER with a bacterial
signal sequence for periplasm translocation.

Expression is optimized and protein folding directed either in
the cytoplasm or in the periplasm. Once folded in the cytoplasm, proteins can accumulate in the same cell compartment, or be exported to the periplasm by the Tat-pathway,
or be secreted to the medium by the type I secretion system.
Unfolded proteins can be translocated post-translationaly
(Sec) or co-translationaly (SPR) into the periplasm and accumulate there, leak to the medium, or be exposed on the
outer membrane. Precipitated proteins can be recovered
into native structure by means of oxidative refolding.

Choice of the suitable secretion leader peptide
In the absence of an N-terminal signal peptide for periplasmic secretion, recombinant polypeptides expressed in
bacteria accumulate in the cytoplasm. The fusion to suitable leader peptides allows for the translocation of
unfolded precursors into the periplasm by either the Sec
(relatively slow, post-translational translocation) or the
SRP (fast, co-translational translocation) system [13,14],
even in the case of aggregation prone proteins such as
PNGase and large molecules like full-length immunoglobulins [15,16]. The search for optimal leader peptides to use in combination with recombinant proteins
has been initially undertaken by comparing the efficiency
of natural signal sequences identified in the precursors of
bacterial periplasmic proteins, including the leader peptides from spA, phoA, ribose binding protein, pelB, ompA,
ompT, dsbA, torA, torT, and tolT. Furthermore, both synthetic sequences and the phage pIII leader peptide were
used [6,9,17-22]. Initially, the approach was not systematic and no clear preference for any among them was
apparent, although ompT resulted preferable when coupled to overexpression of chaperones involved in the stabilization of intermediates translocated through the Sec
export machinery [23].

Mechanism of protein oxidation in the periplasm
Spontaneous protein oxidation in extracytoplasmic compartments is extremely slow and is incompatible with cell
activity. Therefore, it is necessary that the disulfide bond
formation is enzymatically catalyzed. Periplasmic protein
oxidation is regulated by the five members of the Dsb protein system (DsbA, B, C, D, G) [1,2]. With the exception
of DsbB, these proteins belong to the thioredoxin protein
superfamily and are involved in both disulfide-bond formation and rearrangement. Specifically, the soluble monomer protein DsbA donates its disulfide bond to newly
synthesized polypeptides (Figure 3) that are folding intermediates and need disulfide bonds to reach their native
structure. Interestingly, DsbA binds its substrates by
hydrophobic interactions using a chaperone-like recognition mechanism specific for partially unfolded proteins
[27]. Such substrate-independent chaperone-like activity

Periplasm

Modulation of the expression level
Considering the potential danger of having an overcrowded cytoplasm, some authors proposed that protein
secretion could be effectively modulated at the translational level by modifying the Shine-Dalgarno sequence
[4]. Other authors found that the crucial tuning region
starts upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno region and spans
approximately twenty nucleotides downstream of the initiation codon (translational initiation region) [5]. Coherently, also other parameters influencing the expression
rate have been evaluated in relationship with the production of disulfide-bond dependent proteins, such as
growth medium, plasmid origin of replication, and
expression promoters. For instance, the expression features of tac, uspA, uspB, T7, trc, lacUV5, malK, pm/xylS
have been investigated to achieve high product yields by
preventing protein precipitation and cell lysis [6-12].
However, data have been collected under different experimental conditions and, therefore, they are not comparable, preventing the identification of surely preferable
systems.

sequences, even though further unknown biophysical features may be critical. The physiological necessity of the
SRP pathway as an alternative to the post-translational
secretion meditated by the Sec route is required to avoid
premature folding of the proteins in the cytoplasm. The
biotechnological implication of these conclusions is that
poor periplasmic accumulation of rapidly folding recombinant proteins may be the consequence of their non-productive cytoplasmic (mis)folding that prevents efficient
translocation and correct periplasmic folding. Therefore,
the choice of the leader peptide may make the difference
in terms of secretion efficiency, as demonstrated for thermodynamic stable proteins [25,26].

return, is reduced by cytoplasmic thioredoxin.

seems to have a general stabilizing effect on passenger
proteins fused to DsbA mutant deprived of its oxidoreductase activity and, therefore, it has been successfully
used as fusion partner even for the production of cytoplasmic proteins [28].
DsbA active site is regenerated by the transfer of electrons
to the DsbB integral membrane protein, whose activity is
crucial in maintaining DsbA in its active state (Figure 3)
[27,29-32]. The DsbA/DsbB mediated oxidative process is
very efficient, but may result in incorrect cysteine pairing
and in trapping the target protein in non-native conformations. Therefore, a quality control mechanism for the
rearrangement of the disulfide bonds was initially postulated and later identified. DsbC and DsbG are the isomerases that scramble incorrect cystin bridges and, therefore,
play a key-role in the periplasmic protein folding process
(Figure 3) [33-36]. The active cysteines of DsbC and DsbG
must remain reduced in an oxidizing environment to be
functional. This condition is achieved by the action of the
integral inner membrane DsbD. Such protein constantly
reduces the isomerases by transferring to them the electrons made available by the cytoplasmic thioredoxin [3741]. Similarly to DsbA, both DsbC and DsbG have chaperone activity. Since misfolding could be a direct consequence of incorrect disulfides, DsbC/DsbG chaperone
activity favors the recognition and interaction with substrates necessiting disulfide isomerization [1,42]. Such
homodimer isomerases are V-shaped and use the structure
flexibility of the cleft embodied by the two arms to bind
unfolded structures of various sizes. Their adaptability
allows the recognition of largely heterogeneous substrates
and explains the elevated efficiency of bacterial DsbC/
DsbG in isomerasing also heterologous proteins [1].
Although the two routes of keeping DsbA oxidized and
DsbC/DsbG reduced have been always considered strictly
separated [1], recent data indicate a possible direct cooperation between DsbA and DsbC [43], and chimeras of
DsbA and DsbC proved to be able to serve both as oxidase
and as isomerase, thus reconciling the competing pathways leading to DsbA oxidation and DsbC reduction [44].
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that DsbA can be
mutated to become an isomerase by adding a linker with
peptide binding capacity and that provides a dimerisation
domain. These characteristics prevent its immediate oxidation by DsbB and allow substrate recognition and binding [45]. Such results will probably simplify the
biotechnological applications of Dsb proteins in vitro.
Use of Dsb proteins for biotechnological purposes
The relevance of the Dsb protein family for the correct
folding of disulfide-bond dependent proteins in the E. coli
suggested that boosting such molecular machinery could
result in increased yields of correctly folded recombinant

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/26

constructs. The accumulation of a functional scFv was
positively affected by co-expression of DsbA, B, C, D [46],
both DsbAB and DsbCD overexpression improved the
production of active horseradish peroxidase [47], whilst
co-expression of DsbA and DsbC increased the yield of
functional human plasma retinol-binding protein [48].
Fusion to DsbA increased the accumulation of few mg/L
culture medium of active bovine enterokinase and human
pro-insulin, a polypeptide stabilized by three disulfide
bonds [49,50]. However, in the case of Ragi bifunctional
inhibitor, a protein with five overlapping disulfide bonds,
DsbA activity resulted in the accumulation of non-native
intermediates, whilst the availability of DsbC significantly
increased the yield of the native protein both in vitro and
in vivo [51]. Again, the overexpressoion of DsbA, B, C, D
and DsbCD, but not DsbAB, increased the accumulation
of active nerve growth factor beta [52] and DsbC was the
key foldase also for enhancing the production of horseradish peroxidase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
although its synergistic effect with DsbA, B, and D was
detectable [53,54]. These results were confirmed by experiments performed with plasminogen activator and a scFv
[55,56] and seem to indicate that the isomerase DsbC
activity could be the limiting factor for the correct folding
of at least part of the recombinant proteins expressed in
the E. coli periplasm.
The different responses observed when using eukaryotic
substrates and DsbA or DsbC overexpression might be
explained by examining the structure of each single substrate protein. DsbA couples cysteines as soon as they are
available and, therefore, only disulfides between consecutive residues are formed. As a consequence, DsbC activity
is not necessary for proteins in which only disulfide bonds
between consecutive cysteines are present in the native
structure [57]. In contrast, bond scrambling is DsbCdependent. The correlation between the presence of nonconsecutive disulfides and DsbC-dependence for achieving the correct folding has been demonstrated for
eukaryotic as well as for bacterial proteins [51,58]. However, although the bacterial RNaseI is a natural DsbC substrate with three consecutive and one nonconsecutive
disulfide bonds [59], it is possible to artificially tune the
periplasm redox potential to achieve conditions that
allow DsbA to correctly catalyze the bond formation
between the nonconsecutive residues [60].
The pivotal role of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases in supporting the correct folding of disulfide-bond dependent
proteins is conserved in Gram-negative bacterial periplasm [61]. Interestingly, functionality seems to be
retained also by phylogenetically distant proteins, such as
endoplasmic reticulum disulfide isomerase from mammalian and yeast since, despite the low sequence homology, a marked structural similarity exists [62-64]. This

observation led to successful engineering of human
disulfide isomerase in the E. coli periplasm and even in the
Gram-positive Bacillus brevis, with consequent functional
restoration in dsbA mutants and yield improvement of
functional proteins [65,66].
Coexpression of periplasmic chaperones and foldases
The process leading to correct protein folding in the E. coli
periplasm is mediated by the activity of proteins belonging to several classes and that often have partially overlapping functions (Fig 1). There are peptidyl-prolyl
isomerases and chaperones such as SurA, FkpA, PpiA,
PpiD, and Skp, and chaperone/proteases such as DegP
[67-73]. FkpA and SurA overexpression contributed to an
increase in the accumulation of functional human plasma
retinol-binding protein [48], FkpA, DegP, DsbA, and
DsbC rescued the activity of lipase B [74], and both the
chaperone and protease activities of DegP were necessary
to enhance the yields of penicillin acylase [71,75].

The prolyl-cis/trans isomerase activity of Ppi apparently
catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the recombinant antibody folding represented by the isomerization of proline
95 (Kabat numbering) [76]. Its coexpression increased the
solubility of scFvs and Fab fragments [77-79], but this
enzyme was also successfully used as a fusion partner for
recombinant antibody expression [4,80]. Similarly,
fusions to FkpA resulted in increased yields of functional
recombinant antibodies [81,82].
Effect of cytoplasm chaperones on periplasmic protein
accumulation
The mechanisms by which cytoplasmic chaperones can
help periplasmic folding are less clear. In a few cases such
molecules were directly secreted to the periplasmic space,
as was the case of DnaJ and Hsp25 that increased the
yields of native plasminogen activator [83]. Probably such
molecular chaperones had an unspecific stabilizing effect
on folding intermediates, but no sound rationale supports
the strategy of boosting the periplasm with cytoplasmic
chaperones, instead of using periplasmic ones. In contrast, the idea of overexpressing cytoplasmic chaperones
in the cytoplasm might be justified by the consideration
that nascent polypeptides are translocated as unfolded
intermediates into the periplasm by the Sec/SRP systems
and, therefore, their potential aggregation must be prevented (Figure 1). SecB is the natural chaperone that binds
polypeptides to be secreted post-translationaly. Apparently, SecB possesses specificity for 9-residue sequence
motifs enriched in aromatic and basic residues [84]. The
presence of these motifs within recombinant proteins
may considerably influence their chances to be correctly
delivered to the periplasm by the SEC system. However,
the overexpression of other chaperones could compensate

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/26

for poor SecB binding to non-specific substrates. They
might unspecifically recognize and stabilize unfolded
polypeptides in the cytoplasm, as suggested by the observation that chaperone overexpression in the cytoplasm
was beneficial for the accumulation of some periplasmic
proteins [85]. Different combinations have been tested,
such as DnaKJE (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE) that increased the
accumulation of functional scFvs against domoic acid and
the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol [56,86]. DnaKJ co-expression prevented the formation of inclusion bodies of CorA
and improved the periplasmic accumulation of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [87,88]. In contrast, cytoplasmic chaperone overexpression failed to improve the
yields of horseradish peroxidase [47].
The accumulation rate of SecB, the physiological chaperone for the Sec system, is apparently efficiently tuned by
the effective amount of potential substrates and, consequently, its exogenous overexpression was not considered
necessary [13,89,90]. However, in at least one case higher
periplasmic accumulation of heterologous proteins was
detected as a consequence of cytoplasmic SecB overexpression [91]. Other authors found that the overexpression of
SecB and DnaKJ was beneficial in promoting recombinant
accumulation of human proteins in the periplasm, but
only in combination with signal sequence optimization
[92].
Advantages and limitations of fusion constructs
The problem of stabilizing the folding intermediates has
been addressed also by fusing the target polypeptide to
protein carriers. Periplasmic EETI-II, erythropoietin, and
scFv production was increased by fusions with maltosebinding protein and immunoglobulin-constant domain,
whilst human proinsulin and pepsinogen yields were
enhanced by fusions with ecotin, a trypsin inhibitor that
could favor target protein accumulation by reducing its
degradation [93-96]. A double ecotin-ubiquitin tag has
been recently engineered. It should allow both the stabilization of the passenger proteins and their recovery with
their authentic amino terminus [12].

It must be underlined that protein fusion always carries an
inherent risk of resulting in soluble but incorrectly folded
target protein. For instance, fusions of maltose binding
protein and some scFvs resulted in higher periplasmic
yields, but the antibodies were not functional, whilst the
fusion to alkaline phosphatase stabilized both production
and activity [97]. Alkaline phosphatase has been often
used as a fusion partner for recombinant antibodies. It is
not only useful for enhancing the production but, dimerizing, it increases the avidity of the immunoproteins for
their substrate and allows their direct detection by enzymatic assay [97-100].

Microbial Cell Factories 2009, 8:26

Protein A or single and tandem repeats of its B- and Zdomains were successfully used for expressing and purifying a scFv and human proteins such as proinsulin and
coagulation factor VII [9,101-105]. Fusion to barnase
resulted in correct folding of ICK and McoEeTI, but the
construct was directed to the culture medium [106,107].
Other fusion partners, especially in combination with
recombinant antibodies, were considered not for facilitating folding and increasing yields, but to obtain reagents
more suitable for the final applications. A biotinylationconsensus sequence has been fused to Fab fragments to
obtain streptavidin-affine immunoconstructs [108], GFP
has been fused to scFvs for recovering immunuofluorescent reagents [109], and fusion to nuclear import/export
sequences have been used to direct scFvs to specific subcellular localizations [110].
Effect of chemical chaperones
A positive effect of low molecular weight additives (chemical chaperones) supplemented in the culture medium
was sometimes observed in terms of yields of periplasmic
expressed proteins. Sorbitol addition to the culture
medium resulted in higher accumulation of a functional
scFv [46], glycine betaine and sucrose were beneficial for
the folding of immunotoxin and cytochrome c550
[111,112], whilst L-arginine and ethanol increased the
yields of human pro-insulin, plasminogen activator, and
a scFv [50,83]. Also the supply of reduced glutathione,
alone or in combination with DsbC overexpression,
increased the accumulation of disulfide-dependent proteins [51,83].
Twin-arginine translocase pathway
Although the Sec and SRP systems are responsible for
translocating most of the proteins into the periplasm, bacteria possess another mechanism -the twin-arginine translocase (Tat) pathway- that enables the transport of folded
proteins across the inner plasma membrane (Figure 1)
[113]. E. coli genome encodes some tens of proteins with
a signal-peptide capable of interacting with Tat machinery
[114] and such export route has been exploited for recombinant expression as well [115,116]. The overexpression
of all the tatABC genes expressing the proteins involved in
the transport increased the translocation of a fluorescent
reporter [117]. Also the overexpression of the cytoplasmic
chaperone DnaK seems particularly useful in increasing
the efficiency of the Tat pathway at both physiological and
protein overexpression-induced stress conditions
[118,119]. Such effect could be a consequence of the
DnaK role in facilitating the substrate folding into native
structures. Another explanation considers that virtually all
Tat leader peptides contain recognition sequences for
DnaK [120,121]. Therefore, Santini et al. [122] proposed
that DnaK sequesters the protein intermediates in the

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/26

cytoplasm by masking their leader peptide until the folding is complete.
Other chaperone-like proteins as SlyD and TorD have
been reported improving Tat efficiency [118,123,124].
Interestingly, scFvs correctly folded in the cytoplasm
(intrabody mutants or wild type constructs expressed in
trxB-gor- cells) were efficiently transported by the Tat system [125,126].
High throughput selection of suitable clones
Protein accumulation varies from cell to cell inside a population and, therefore, strategies for selecting the most
productive clones are relevant. Similarly, it may be necessary to identify, within large bacteria cultures expressing
clone libraries, the few cells producing proteins/antibodies with desired features. Flow cytometry represents a
powerful methodology since it enables a quick and thorough screen of large numbers of constructs and it has been
successfully applied for selecting proteins, recombinant
and full-length antibodies accumulated in the periplasm
[127-132]. Several approaches have been described, all
referring to the same principle of labeling proteins accumulated in the periplasm to enable the isolation of the
productive bacteria. In the simplest protocol, proteins
accumulate directly in the the periplasm, otherwise
recombinant antibodies are anchored to the periplasmic
side of the inner membrane through a lipoprotein
domain, or full-length antibodies, secreted and folded in
the periplasm, are captured through their Fc domain by an
anchoring fusion construct consisting of the Z-domain of
the Protein A and an inner membrane lipoprotein
[129,132]. The outer membrane is successively permeabilized to form spheroplasts and the recombinant proteins/
antibodies are labeled by binding to fluorescent antibodies/antigens. Finally, the cultured bacteria are sorted by
flow cytometry according to the expression and affinity of
the produced constructs. Such approach may become a
paradigm for efficiently screening tagged proteins and
antibodies expressed in the periplasmic space.
Periplasmic inclusion body formation
Despite the periplasmic quality control and the observation that the FkpA chaperone activity seems to be effective
in suppressing inclusion body formation [133], proteins
can aggregate also in this cellular compartment. The simple overexpression is already sufficient to induce the accumulation of the bacterial beta-lactamase protein inclusion
bodies into the periplasm [134,135]. Similarly to what
was observed in cytoplasmic aggregates, the proteins
trapped in periplasmic inclusion bodies may partially preserve their physiological activity [135] and induce stress
response [136]. There are relatively few papers reporting
the accumulation of heterologous protein inclusion bodies in bacterial periplasm [8,75,137-139]. However, the

Page 6 of 18

Microbial Cell Factories 2009, 8:26

number might be underestimated because cell fractionation is rarely undertaken and negative results are often not
communicated. From the available information it seems
that construct instability is often present in engineered
polypeptides. For instance, both the addition of unpaired
cysteines and sub-optimal length or composition of the
linkers connecting the variable domains may be strongly
detrimental for the scFv yields [140,141]. Jeong and Lee
systematically tried to alleviate heterologous protein precipitation in the periplasm by analyzing the effect of bacterial strain, growth temperature, expression vector
features (signal peptide, promoter, codon usage optimization, linker compositions), and DsbA co-expression, but
general conclusions require further studies [8,142].
Induced accumulation of periplasmic proteins into the
culture medium
The recovery of periplasmic proteins is usually achieved
by disruption of the outer membrane by osmotic shock.
Such purification protocol has the advantage of limiting
the contamination with cytoplasmic material. However,
as an alternative it has been also proposed to induce the
lysis of the outer membrane to recover the target protein
directly from the culture medium avoiding a cumbersome
purification step (Figure 2). The most investigated solution is based on the expression of Kil protein, a bacteriocin that induces periplasmic protein release through
induced membrane solubilization [143,144]. Lysis can be
induced by regulating the Kil protein expression with a
stationary-phase or a temperature inducible promoter
[145,146] and the strategy was successfully used to
recover from the medium interleukin-2, beta-glucanase,
and streptavidin [144,145,147]. Also the co-expression of
the TolA protein has been proposed for inducing the
external membrane permeabilization [17].

The accumulation of proteins in the culture medium, and
specifically of recombinant antibodies, expressed for
being secreted into the periplasm has been often observed
[148,149]. The reasons remain unknown and cell lysis
does not seem to be always involved in the protein leakage. However, it has been shown that several different factors such as growth conditions, inducer concentration,
and aminoacid substitutions can tune the leakage of scFvs
and have been proposed as means to regulate scFv partition between periplasm and medium [149,150]. The
influence of the expression level on protein leakage from
the periplasm to the growth medium has been directly
demonstrated comparing different promoters [10].

Cytoplasmic expression
Early observations indicated that the disulfide bridges in
both Î²-lactamase and alkaline phosphatase precursors
expressed in E. coli were formed only after their translocation and processing in the periplasm and that it was pos-

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/26

sible to prevent their oxidative folding by trapping the
precursors in the cytoplasm [151,152]. These results were
explained by the presence of a reducing cytoplasm and an
oxidizing periplasm in bacteria. Furthermore, they indicated that no protein requiring the formation of disulfide
bonds for reaching its native structure can be produced in
a functional form in the cytoplasm. The correlation
between presence of disulfide bonds and native, functional structures was exploited by Beckwith and co-workers in their pioneering attempt to identify mutations that
enabled the formation of active alkaline phosphatase in
bacteria cytoplasm. It turned out that alkaline phosphatase folded correctly when expressed in bacteria hosting mutations that blocked the reduction of cysteines in
the cytoplasm by silencing the activity of the thioredoxin
reductase [153]. The preliminary model indicated that
NADPH was the source of reducing potential used by
thioredoxin reductase to reduce oxidized thioredoxin.
However, the data suggested that another thioredoxin-like
protein could be involved in a parallel reducing route. The
search for complementary reducing mechanism(s) led to
the identification of a second thioredoxin and of glutathione oxidoreductases, all involved in the mechanism
aimed at reducing cytoplasmic cysteines [154,155]. The
apparent redundancy of the reducing machinery is probably due to the necessity of obtaining the maximal electron
transfer efficiency between protein pairs with varying
redox potentials [156]. Under physiological conditions
the directionality of the electron flux is maintained. However, it was shown that thioredoxin acts as a reductase
only when it remains constantly reduced by the thioredoxin reductase activity. In contrast, it can catalyze substrate oxidation when exported to periplasm and oxidized
by DsbB [157,158]. Also glutaredoxin 3 can catalyze
disulfide bond formation in the periplasm, but its activity
depends on oxidized glutathione availability rather than
DsbB [159]. A similar process has been already demonstrated in eukaryotic cells [160] and its existence may also
be hypothesed in the bacterial cytoplasm wherethe environment becomes oxidized as a consequence of impaired
reducing activities.
Summarizing, it is possible to obtain an oxidizing cytoplasm in a cellular system in which glutaredoxin activity is
abrogated by gor- mutation, and both thioredoxin 1 and 2
are kept oxidized as a consequence of thioredoxin reductase mutations (Figure 1). Reduced glutathione, necessary
to preserve cell viability, is produced by the disulfide
reductase activity of mutated peroxiredoxin AhpC
[161,162]. Interestingly, AhpC reductase activity does not
significantly influence the oxidizing condition of the cytoplasm in trxB-, gor- cells [162]. Such observation prompted
to investigate the biotechnological potential of both single (trxB-) and double (trxB-, gor-) mutant strains -now
commercialized with the names of AD494 and Origami

(Novagen), respectively- for the cytoplasmic expression of
recombinant proteins with multiple disulfide bonds in
their native structure. The encouraging data obtained in
the first attempts [163] were further improved by combining cytoplasmic oxidation conditions and cytoplasmic
accumulation of DsbC isomerase (Figure 1) [164].
Recently, a new expression strain has become available.
SHuffle (New England BioLab) is trxB-, gor- as the commercial Origami (Novagen), but overexpresses cytoplasmic DsbC and is spectinomycin selectable, allowing the
transformation with the majority of the currently used
vectors. Although no literature is available so far, it is
expected that the SHuffle combination of oxidizing conditions and isomerization capability would strongly
improve the correct folding of disulfide bond-dependent
proteins in the E. coli cytoplasm.
The method of expressing disulfide-bond-dependent proteins in oxidized cytoplasm was validated by several
groups and progressively optimized. The collagen prolyl
4-hydrolases yield was higher in the cytoplasm of trxB-,
gor- bacteria than in the periplasm of the corresponding
BL21 wild type strain [165]. The oxidized cytoplasm
allowed the accumulation of functional IgG-like extracellular domain receptor [166], Ig2 domain of neurolin
[167], lipase B [168,169], chitinase [170], and anti-freeze
proteins [171]. Furthermore, the correct formation of
disulfide bonds in the cytoplasmic milieu has been
proved in recombinant oxalate oxidase [172], peanut
allergen Ara h 2 [173], and Stereum purpureum endopolygalacturonase [174].
A specific class of disulfide-bonded proteins: the
recombinant antibodies
As a consequence of the constantly increasing importance
of recombinant antibody expression, a significant effort
has been dedicated for optimizing their production in
bacteria. Although few antibodies are stable in the
absence of disulfide bonds and can be directly expressed
as intrabodies in the reducing cytoplasm of host cells
[175-179], the structure and the functionality of most of
them strictly depends on correct cys-cys bridges.

Recombinant antibodies in scFv format have one intrachain disulfide bond for each variable region, those in Fab
format have a further inter chain bond. A scFv fragment
fused to a consensus peptide for obtaining in vivo site-specific biotinylation, a bivalent Fv antibody fragment fused
to molybdopterin synthase to induce its oligomerization,
and some Fab fragments were successfully produced in
the cytoplasm of trxB-, gor- cells [180-182]. Camelidae
recombinant antibodies in VHH format possess one intrachain disulfide bond between framework residues and

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/26

may have a further one to constrain the CDR3 loop. Also
these antibodies and have been successfully produced in
the cytoplasm of trxB-, gor- bacteria [183].
Stabilizing role of chaperones and DsbC isomerase
Chaperones and isomerase can facilitate the target protein
folding by impairing non-productive aggregation of folding intermediates and have been often co-expressed. The
cytoplasmic overexpression of the periplasmic chaperone
Skp and of DsbC isomerase, as well as of the molecular
chaperones GroELS and trigger factor, significantly
improved the yields of recombinant antibodies [184],
whilst the cytoplasmic co-expression of Skp and FkpA
were ineffective in rescuing fibrolase venom, in contrast to
the beneficial effect of DsbC [185]. The work of other
groups confirmed that the cytoplasmic co-expression of
DsbC in trxB-, gor-bacteria was advantageous for the functional cytoplasmic accumulation of recombinant antibodies in both scFv and VHH format [183,186]. In such
conditions the oxidizing environment favors the formation of the cys-cys bridges inside the polypeptide sequence
and the isomerase apparently improves the yields of correctly folded antibodies by exchanging the cysteine residues involved in non-native pairing. The strategy of
coupling cytoplasm oxidative conditions and isomerase
activity was optimized by Yuan et al. [187] who overproduced thioredoxin fusions of calobin venom in the presence of cytoplasmic trapped DsbC. Co-expression of
DsbC, GroELS and, at lower extent, of trigger factor
resulted in higher yields of a functional scFv against the
receptor c-Met [188], whilst the recombinant co-expression of a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase from Pyrococcus
improved yields and functionality of recombinant Fab
fragment [189]. A well-documented review addressing the
specific problem of the recombinant antibody expression
in prokaryotes has been published by Arbabi-Ghahroudi
et al. [190].
Thioredoxin overexpression
The cytoplasmic accumulation of thioredoxin as a consequence of its recombinant overexpression in wild type
bacteria was proposed for increasing the yields of coexpressed eukaryotic proteins without disulfide bonds in
their native structure [191]. Similarly, the precipitation of
eukaryotic disulfide-bond independent proteins in the
bacteria cytoplasm was prevented after their fusion to
thioredoxin [192]. Cytoplasmic expression of thioredoxin
fusions rescued also polypeptides that failed to correctly
fold in the periplasm [187], plant viscotoxins, and porcine pepsinogen A, although these proteins contain multiple disulfide bridges [193,194]. The reasons as to why
thioredoxin can stabilize its passenger proteins in wild
type bacteria is not well understood, although its contribution to scFv folding might be due to its chaperone prop-

Microbial Cell Factories 2009, 8:26

erties [195], since a catalytic cysteine thioredoxin mutant
was still effective in supporting both disulfide bond formation and functionality of the target protein [196].
In contrast, there is a logical reason for overexpressing
cytoplasmic thioredoxin in double mutant trxB-, gor-bacteria since such enzyme can act as an oxidant when it operates in an oxidized milieu [157]. Therefore, it can actively
contribute to maintain oxidizing conditions in the cytoplasm. Fusions between recombinant scFvs and thioredoxin 1 expressed in trxB-, gor- bacteria resulted in
increased cytoplasmic yields [196], correct folding of a
scFv against the c-Met receptor [188], and of the first
domain of the multiple Kazal-type inhibitor LEKTI, a
polypeptide that contains two disulfide bridges in its
native structure [197]. Both the His- and GST-fusions of
BSPH1, a protein containing 2 fibronectin type-II
domains each consisting of 2 disulfide bonds, aggregated
when expressed in the cytoplasm of trxB-, gor- bacteria, but
their fusions with thioredoxin resulted insoluble and
active proteins [198].
Carriers used to improve protein correct folding
Other proteins have been used as fusion partners and
showed positive effects on folding and functionality of
recombinant proteines accumulated in bacteria cytoplasm. Carboxyterminus fusions to maltose binding protein stabilized several scFvs independently on the
cytoplasm redox conditions [199], although less efficiently than thioredoxin [196], whilst fusion to NusA was
strictly necessary to yield another functional scFv and
APRIL in the cytoplasm of trxB-, gor- cells [200,201]. Sumo
has also been proposed as solubilizing carrier for
disulfide-bonded proteins, but the structural quality of
the recovered proteins has not been investigated
[202,203]. However, in a recent report it has been shown
that a scFv against VEGF-165 was soluble and active when
expressed fused to sumo [204].
Minimal redox conditions compatible with disulfide bond
formation
Although the rational background for the expression of
disulfide-bond dependent proteins in double mutant
strain trxB-, gor- is generally accepted and such strain has
been successfully exploited, alone or in combination with
the expression of foldases/chaperones, the usefulness of
the single trxB- mutation remains unclear. The glutathione
oxidoreductase is still functional in such bacteria and its
activity should be sufficient to keep the cytoplasm partially reduced [156]. Consequently, disulfide bond formation should be at least partially impaired. In practice, only
minimal amounts of all expressed scFvs remained soluble
and functional in the cytoplasm of trxB- (AD494) cells
[109] and the advantage over controls was limited also in

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/26

the presence of thioredoxin co-expression [205]. A direct
comparison between AD494 and trxB-, gor- bacteria clearly
indicated an advantage in using the double mutant [196].
In contrast, the same cells resulted significantly more efficient than conventional XL-Blue cells in producing an
anti-progesterone scFv [206]. However, data concerning
the oxidation state of this antibody are not reported.
Information concerning folding features or functionality
is limited also in other cases in which proteins were successfully produced in the cytoplasm of AD494 cells. However, at least in the case of the scorpion neurotoxin Lqq-V
and fibronectin II-2 domain from MMP-2, the proteins
were both functional and correctly folded [207,208]. Furthermore, the trxB- strain, in combination with DnaKJ coexpression, allowed the production of biological active
human SPARC in the cytoplasm [209]. In the case of a serpin domain, AD494 cells did not improve the total
amount of soluble recombinant protein accumulated in
the cytoplasm with respect to wild type bacteria, but it was
correctly folded and active, whilst the protein expressed in
the control cells did not form the essential disulfide bonds
[210]. GroELS co-expression further increased the serpin
domain solubility. In some cases, the combination of
AD494 cells and thioredoxin fusions significantly
improved the expression of functional target proteins.
Leishmania chitinase, the extracellular domain of human
thyrotropin receptor, and the disintegrin domain of jararhagin venom were purified, in large amounts, as soluble
and active proteins [211-213].
In contrast, it has been reported that a pro-urokinase
fusion with thioredoxin expressed in AD494 (DE3) strain
accumulated in inclusion bodies, even when the system
was supplemented with disulfide isomerase and chaperonines [214]. However, there is scarce access to negative
results that would help in understanding the factors regulating disulfide bond-dependent protein expression in the
cytoplasm of wild type and mutant strains.
Protein engineering
A time-consuming but definitive approach for avoiding
trial-and-error attempts in identifying the optimal cytoplasmic expression conditions to yield functional proteins
with disulfide bonds is the generation of mutants that
maintain a stable structure even in the absence of cys-cys
bridges [215]. Such protein engineering efforts were particularly successful in the case of recombinant antibodies.
Various strategies of mutation and molecular evolution
have been used to generate disulfide-independent stable
scFvs starting from a reduction-sensitive precursor
[175,216-218]. Intrabodies were recovered from libraries
in which CDR variability was introduced by hypermutation of a naturally disulfide bond-independent VHH or
scFv backbone [219,220], and by selecting natural intra-

Microbial Cell Factories 2009, 8:26

bodies by biopanning [186,220-222]. Such molecules are
valuable tools with great application potentiality for intracellular immunization [179,223,224].
The substitution of critical residues in both the framework
and in the CDRs has also been used to improve the periplasmic accumulation of recombinant antibodies
[150,225-227].
Outer membrane-bound proteins
Expressing secreted proteins anchored on the external side
of bacteria membranes [228] has been initially considered
to render them accessible for external binders rather than
to produce material for purification purpose. Avirulent
bacteria displaying peptides corresponding to pathologyrelated antigen determinants on their surface were
designed as vaccine tools [229-231]. They succeeded in
stimulating immunological reactions [229-234], but the
externally anchored peptides were not thoroughly characterized at structural level and, therefore, it cannot be ruled
out that immunoresponse was promoted by partially
unfolded antigen domains.

However, more recent data show that correctly folded
fusions of outer membrane transporters and both scFv
and VHH recombinant antibodies were efficiently translocated on the outer bacteria surface [235,236]. Once displayed, anchored proteins can be automatically released
into the medium by cleavage of a specific sequence recognized by a membrane protease like OmpT [233,237].
Several bacteria transporter proteins have been used to
develop vectors in which they are fused to the proteins of
interest [238,239], such as FliC [240], pullulanase [241],
OprF [242], OprI [243], PhoE [229], MisL [237,244,245],
and cytolysin [234].
Exposing the protein to the outer bacteria surface is a particularly valuable approach when the proteins can be
directly used in such format. For instance, enteric coronaviruses were successfully neutralized in cultured epithelial
cells treated with E. coli expressing fusions of IgA protease
beta domain from Neisseria gonnorrhoeae with specific
scFvs [246]. An adhesion domain of intimin has been
used as an anchoring partner for exposing both proteins
and peptide libraries on the surface of the bacteria outer
membrane. The resulting bacteria were suitable for cell
sorting and used to identify epitope-specific antibodies
[247,248].
Type I (extra cellular) secretion pathway
The type I secretion pathway is used by Gram-negative
bacteria to transfer toxins and exoenzymes provided of a
carboxyterminus export signal directly from the cytoplasm to the external medium [249-251]. These proteins

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/26

are devoid of disulfide bridges but the work performed by
Fernandez and co-workers demonstrated that fusions of
the secreted protein alfa-haemolysin C-domain and antibody fragments devoid of periplasm export signal peptide
were efficiently secreted in oxidized and functional form
[252-254]. Functional alfa-haemolysin fusions of both
scFvs and VHHs were recovered from the culture medium
[252-255] and hemolysin-fusion of Shiga toxin B subunit
[245] was able to induce host immunoreaction in inoculated rabbits.
Oxidative refolding of denatured proteins
Despite the great effort made by several groups for obtaining native proteins with correctly folded disulfide bridges
in bacteria, many attempts failed and target proteins accumulated as precipitates. This observation prompted other
groups to turn the disappointing results into an opportunity of pulling together large amounts of proteins and
developing oxidative refolding strategies.

The methodologies available for protein refolding have
been thoroughly reviewed [256-258] and here only
parameters that are of specific interest for the disulfide
bond-dependent proteins will be briefly presented.
Two common requisites for a refolding buffer are the presence of a redox couple and of alkaline pH. The redox couple (GSH/GSSG, MESNA/diMESNA, heteroaromatic
thiols) is necessary to activate the cys residues [259-261],
whilst the alkaline pH facilitates the nucleophilic attackdependent disulfide bond formation [262]. Low temperature generally prevents non-productive contacts of metastable folding intermediates and can improve the final
yields [263]. Non-productive interactions have been also
successfully limited by modifying the reduced thiol
groups before starting the refolding process. The cysteines
of denatured proteins are first S-sulfonated or transformed into mixed disulfides and then the disulfide
bonds are formed in the presence of a suitable redox system [259,264]. Surfactants and polyethylene glycol also
showed stabilizing properties [265,266], whilst a dynamic
redox environment, in which the conditions pass progressively from reductive to oxidative, has been proposed to
maximize disulfide bond shuffling [267]. However, also
simple dilution was effective for refolding heavy chain
single domains [268].
An interesting recent paper shows the contradictory effect
that stabilizing molecules may have on the refolding of
disulfide-bond dependent proteins [269]. L-arginine is
known to slow down the refolding process while suppressing hydrophobic interactions. Both these factors
have been usually interpreted as an advantage for efficient
refolding. However, although hydrophobic aggregation is
prevented, the accumulation of intermediates with free

Microbial Cell Factories 2009, 8:26

cysteines leads to the formation of intermolecular
disulfide bonds and the formation of progressively larger
oligomers in an arginine-concentration dependent manner.
Productive oxidative refolding can be improved by different means. Chromatography allows separating the target
protein from contaminants that can interfere during folding and has been successfully used to achieve the refolding
of thioredoxin-scFv fusion proteins [270]. Furthermore,
binding unfolded protein to a substrate impairs the physical interaction amongst single molecules and their refolding can be performed in a sort of "independent microenvironment" in which aggregation-driving contacts are
prevented. Optimization is necessary with respect to salt
concentrations to avoid protein-matrix interactions. Oncolumn refolding was successfully performed by using
metal affinity chromatography, as in the case of ribonuclease A [260], chemokines [271], and Î±-glucosidase
[272], ion-exchange substrates, as for bovine serum albumin [273] and alfa-lactalbumin [274], or by using zeolite
[275,276].
Different classes of proteins can contribute to an increase
in the refolding yields of native proteins (Figure 1).
Thioredoxin supported the productive refold of both
reduced denatured and oxidized but incorrectly paired
disulfides of pancreatic RNase, citrate synthase and alphaglucosidase [195,277]. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase was
beneficial for the refolding of Fab fragments [278], whilst
the disulfide isomerase, alone or in combination with
quiescin-sulphydryl oxidase and glutaredoxin, facilitated
the oxidative folding of ribonuclease A and riboflavin
binding protein [279-281]. The fusion to the chaperone
SlyD had a positive effect on the refolding of the ectodomain E1 of Rubella virus [282]. DsbA, peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase, and GroEL minichaperone were immobilized on
an agarose gel to refold the scorpion toxin Cn5 [283],
immobilized DsbA, DsbC and GroEL minichaperone
were effective in refolding single-chain fragments [284],
disulfide isomerase was beneficial for ribonuclease and
lysozyme refolding [285], and DnaK in combination with
trigger factor or disulfide isomerase helped the functional
folding of scFv alone and fused to a toxin domain
[286,287]. The availability of ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE
improved the refolding efficiency of the cysteine-rich protein gloshedobin [288]. Finally, high-pressure has also
been used to prevent the formation of nonnative disulfide
bonds [289].

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/26

is the trial-and-error strategy. However, the comprehension of the physiological mechanisms involved in the protein folding and aggregation allowed for more rational
solutions that simplified the selection of the conditions to
be used in the trial panel (Figure 2).
Robust tools, such as oxidizing mutant strains or plasmids
for the overexpression of chaperones and foldases, are
now available and several successful expression alternatives have been described. There is still no certainty that a
specific disulfide-bond dependent protein will be
expressed in a functional form in bacteria, but a series of
rational approaches can easily be compared. Once optimized the construct DNA sequence and the expression
conditions, the main choice is between cytoplasmic and
periplasmic folding and accumulation of the target protein. It will guide the selection of opportune leader
sequences and suitable bacteria strains. Finally, the purification strategy will request further modification if the proteins are to be recovered from inclusion bodies, total
lysate, periplasmic fractions, or culture medium.
At the end of this review, it becomes apparent that there is
a large amount of information missing concerning the
accurate description of the molecular mechanisms
involved in protein folding, translocation and molecular
quality control. There is also a huge gap between the theoretical knowledge and the results of protein production,
as these are only sometimes in agreement with the hypothetical expectations and the apparent irrationality of
some successful conditions may seem as if it were a "magical" activity. In contrast, what we are missing is a coherent system for the comparison of experimental data that
remain anecdotal unless precisely annotated. Our understanding of why some conditions work in one case, but
not in another, will substantially increase when a sufficient amount of homogeneous and comparable data will
be available for bioinformatic analyses [290]. Data organization and their direct accessibility would help in extrapolating the information necessary to improve the
identification of optimal strategies for each specific class
of polypeptides. Therefore, the future collective endeavor
should be addressed at rationalizing rather than accumulating data. One example to follow for future attempts
might be the public repository Refold database http://
refold.med.monash.edu.au/ that lists the successful methods for refolding of proteins [291].
