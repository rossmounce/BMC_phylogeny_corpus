Analysis on the reconstruction accuracy of the
Fitch method for inferring ancestral states
Jialiang Yang, Jun Li, Liuhuan Dong, Stefan Grünewald*

Abstract
Background: As one of the most widely used parsimony methods for ancestral reconstruction, the Fitch method
minimizes the total number of hypothetical substitutions along all branches of a tree to explain the evolution of a
character. Due to the extensive usage of this method, it has become a scientific endeavor in recent years to study
the reconstruction accuracies of the Fitch method. However, most studies are restricted to 2-state evolutionary
models and a study for higher-state models is needed since DNA sequences take the format of 4-state series and
protein sequences even have 20 states.
Results: In this paper, the ambiguous and unambiguous reconstruction accuracy of the Fitch method are studied
for N-state evolutionary models. Given an arbitrary phylogenetic tree, a recurrence system is first presented to
calculate iteratively the two accuracies. As complete binary tree and comb-shaped tree are the two extremal
evolutionary tree topologies according to balance, we focus on the reconstruction accuracies on these two
topologies and analyze their asymptotic properties. Then, 1000 Yule trees with 1024 leaves are generated and
analyzed to simulate real evolutionary scenarios. It is known that more taxa not necessarily increase the
reconstruction accuracies under 2-state models. The result under N-state models is also tested.
Conclusions: In a large tree with many leaves, the reconstruction accuracies of using all taxa are sometimes less
than those of using a leaf subset under N-state models. For complete binary trees, there always exists an
equilibrium interval [a, b] of conservation probability, in which the limiting ambiguous reconstruction accuracy
equals to the probability of randomly picking a state. The value b decreases with the increase of the number of
states, and it seems to converge. When the conservation probability is greater than b, the reconstruction accuracies
of the Fitch method increase rapidly. The reconstruction accuracies on 1000 simulated Yule trees also exhibit
similar behaviors. For comb-shaped trees, the limiting reconstruction accuracies of using all taxa are always less
than or equal to those of using the nearest root-to-leaf path when the conservation probability is not less than
1 . As a result, more taxa are suggested for ancestral reconstruction when the tree topology is balanced and the
N
sequences are highly similar, and a few taxa close to the root are recommended otherwise.

Background
Ancestral state reconstruction attempts to predict properties of ancestral proteins, genes and even whole genomes in a given phylogeny according to data of extant
species. This approach to understanding protein functions and evolution was first proposed by Pauling and
Zukerkandl in their seminal work [1]. Thereafter, with
the increasing availability of biological data it has
become a technique of growing importance in

investigating the functions and origins of genes and proteins [2-9].
Parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) are the two
most popular criteria utilized to reconstruct ancestral
states when the phylogenetic tree representing the evolutionary history of a character is known [6,10]. Parsimony methods minimize the total number of
hypothetical substitutions along all branches of the evolutionary tree. The Fitch method was the first parsimony
method for inferring ancestral states [11]. It is a linear
time algorithm and is accurate for taxa with highly similar sequences. The method was later modified by Sankoff to account for different rates of substitutions among

states [12,13]. The reader is referred to a survey book
[14] for reviews of parsimony methods and their variants. In contrast to parsimony methods, ML methods
choose a state to be the ancestral state such that the
observed states could have been evolved from it with
maximum likelihood. ML inference of ancestral
sequences was pioneered by Yang, Kumar and Nei [15]
and by Koshi and Goldstein [16]. Later, a widely used
variant of ML method called the Bayesian approach was
introduced by Huelsenbeck and his coworkers [17,18].
The reader is referred to [6] and [19] for reviews of ML
methods and their variants.
Due to the extensive usage of ancestral reconstruction
methods, it has become a significant scientific endeavor
to study their reconstruction accuracies. These accuracies
of different methods have been either estimated by statistical simulations [20,21] or calculated precisely by theoretical analyses [22-27]. For example, under a 2-state JukesCantor model, several recurrence systems for calculating
the reconstruction accuracies of the Fitch algorithm were
presented for a given phylogenetic tree [22,24,25,27]. It
was shown in these studies that the reconstruction
accuracies depend largely on the topology of the phylogenetic tree. Thus, reconstruction accuracies and their
asymptotic properties on the number of leaves were also
analyzed for extremal trees like complete binary trees
and comb-shaped trees (or rooted caterpillars) [25,27].
However, by far most theoretical analyses have been limited to 2-state models. More effort should be made to
study the reconstruction accuracies under higher-state
models as there are 4 states for DNA sequences and even
20 states for protein sequences.
In this paper, we study the ambiguous and unambiguous reconstruction accuracy of the Fitch algorithm for
reconstructing the root state under N-state evolutionary
models. We first present a general recurrence system for
calculating the reconstruction accuracies on any given
phylogenetic tree. We developed software that implements this system. As pointed out by Li et al. [24], more
taxa are not necessarily better for the reconstruction of
ancestral states. Our recurrence system and software
can be used to select good subsets of taxa to reconstruct
ancestral DNAs, proteins, or other characters.
After that, we restrict the analyses to 3 extremal evolutionary trees under the N-state Jukes-Cantor model,
namely equal-branch complete binary tree, equal-branch
comb-shaped tree and Hennigain comb-shaped tree
[24,28]. It is clear that for the equal-branch trees the
substitution probability along any branch is the same
and is denoted by p, thus the conservation probability is
q: = 1 - (N - 1)p. As examples, we analyze reconstruction accuracies and their asymptotic properties on the
number of leaves for N = 2, 4, 5, 20. We also compare

Page 2 of 9

the limiting ambiguous and unambiguous reconstruction
accuracy of using all taxa with those of using a nearest
root-to-leaf path. Finally, 1000 Yule trees with 1024
leaves are generated by the software Mesquite [29] and
analyzed to simulate real phylogenetic trees.
From the studies, we observe several interesting properties for the reconstruction accuracies under N-state
models. First, for equal-branch complete binary trees,
there always exists an equilibrium interval [a, b] of conservation probability q such that, with the number of
leaves tending to infinity, the ambiguous reconstruction
1
accuracy converges to N , the reconstruction accuracy
of randomly picking the ancestral state from N possible
states. For example, the equilibrium interval for
complete binary trees is ⎡ 1 , 7 ⎤ under the 2-state
⎢8 8⎥
⎣
⎦
Jukes-Cantor model [22,25,27]. However, a becomes 0
when N ≥ 3. We calculate b for N = 2, ..., 25 and find
that b decreases slowly with the increase of N. The
reconstruction accuracies for 1000 Yule trees exhibit
similar behaviors. Second, for any equal-branch combshaped tree, the limiting reconstruction accuracies using
the nearest root-to-leaf path are always greater than
those using all taxa if the conservation probability is lar1
ger than N . Finally, for any Hennigian comb-shaped
tree, the limiting ambiguous reconstruction accuracy is
1
always equal to that of randomly picking a state, N ,
whereas the limiting unambiguous one is equal to
N N −2
N
(N − 1)! .
∑i =l N N −i (N − x)!

Our results suggest that more taxa should be used for
reconstructing ancestral states if the tree topology is
balanced and the sequences are highly similar, whereas
some taxa close to the root are recommended if the tree
topology is very unbalanced. In addition, under evolutionary models with molecular clock, the reconstructed
state by the Fitch algorithm is as bad as a state randomly picked when the conservation probability is low
or the phylogenetic tree is very unbalanced. The suggestions are also partially applicable for ML methods as
ML inference of the root state is the same as that of
maximum parsimony estimation under simple models
such as Jukes-Cantor models when the branch lengths
of the phylogenetic tree are unknown [30].

Methods
The Fitch Method

Let C be a character with state set  and T be a rooted
phylogenetic tree in which each leaf is assigned a state in
 . The Fitch method infers the states of internal nodes
in a two-stage process, namely the “leaf-to-root stage”

Yang et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/18

and the “root-to-leaf stage”. In the first stage, it assigns a
set of states Su to each node u of T as follows:
(1) If u is a leaf, Su contains only the state of u,
(2) If u is an internal node having children v and w,
⎧ S v ∩ S w if S v ∩ S w ≠ ∅,
Su = Sv * Sw = ⎨
⎩ S v ∪ S w otherwise.

The assignment starts from the leaves, and proceeds
to the internal nodes until the root r is assigned a subset
Sr. In the second stage, only one state su is chosen from
the state subset Su at each node u. This is realized by
first picking randomly a state in S r , and proceeding
downwards as follows. Suppose v is a child of u, then
⎧ su
sv = ⎨
⎩ any state in S v

if s u ∈ S v ,
otherwise.

As a result, any state in Sr is chosen as the root state
1
with an equal probability S , where |S r | denotesthe
r
cardinality of Sr.

distributions of the states each with some probability.
The Fitch method is then applied to these distributions
to infer ancestral states. Let Ψ be the set containing all
the possible distributions of leaf states. For any state
i ∈  and any distribution  ∈ Ψ , let Pr[ | i] be the
probability that the leaf nodes receive the distribution
 , given that the state at the root is i. Let B ⊆  , we
further let C(B,  ) be the probability that the Fitch
method reconstructs set B at root from  . Since both
the evolutionary model and the Fitch method are symmetric on all states, the reconstruction accuracies are
independent of the prior distribution of initial states.
Thus, we choose 1 to be the root state and the unambiguous reconstruction accuracy (UA) is defined as
UA =

Unambiguous and ambiguous reconstruction accuracy
are two important criteria to evaluate the quality of a
reconstruction method. Let C be a character with state
set  = {s1 , s 2 , ..., s N } . For simplicity, we order the
states and restate  = {1, 2,  , N } . In order to study
the reconstruction accuracies of the Fitch method on a
given phylogenetic tree T with root r, a Markov model
is usually assumed to represent the true biological evolutionary process of C, which specifies:
(1) Pr[tr = i], that is, the initial probability that the
root state is i for i = 1, 2, . . . , N , and
(2) Pr[tv = j | tu = i], that is, the transition probability that a state i evolves to j along the branch from
node u to v for any I, j = 1, 2, . . . , N and branch uv.
In particular, Pr[tv = i | tu = i] is called the conservation probability of i along uv, and Pr[tv = j | tu = i] with
i ≠ j is called the substitution probability from i to j
along uv. Clearly, the probability of a state in each node
is already determined by the model. For any state i and
vertex u in T, we use Pr[tu = i] to denote the probability
that the state of u is i. We assume throughout this
paper that the evolutionary model is symmetric on all
states, that is Pr[tv = j | tu = i] = Pr[tv = i | tu = j] and
Pr[tv = i | tu = i] = Pr[tv = j | tu = j] for any two states i
and j, and any branch uv.
After the character evolves from the root r under the
model, the leaves will receive one of many possible

(1)

the probability that it outputs the true state 1. Similarly, the ambiguous reconstruction accuracy (AA) is
defined as
AA =

That is, if the reconstructed set B contains 1, there is
1
still a probability of B to infer the true root state.
Recurrence Relations to Calculate Reconstruction
Accuracies

Let Z be an internal node with two children X and Y.
Since the evolutionary model is symmetric on all N
states, the substitution probability between any two
states is the same along a given branch. We use pX and
p Y to denote the substitution probabilities along
branches ZX and ZY, respectively. Clearly, the corresponding conservation probabilities on any state are 1 (N - 1)pX and 1 - (N - 1)pY. In the following, we derive
a recursive system involving 2N - 1 recursive formulas
to calculate the reconstruction accuracies of a parent
node from those of its two children.
Before we present the system, it is worthy of mentioning
that the original dynamic programming approach in Maddison [23] can be applied to calculate both accuracies for
N-state models. However, it involves the calculation of
2N - 1 recursive formulas to calculate the reconstruction
accuracies of a parent node from those of its two children,
which is not efficient when both the evolutionary tree and
the number of states N are large. Here, we take the advantage of the symmetries of both the Fitch method and the
evolutionary models. More precisely, the reconstructed
root states are categorized into 2N - 1 classes. Let
2i −1 = {B ⊆  : 1∈ B and B = i} for 1 ≤ i ≤ N

Yang et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/18

and 2i = {B ⊆  : 1 ∈ B and B = i} for 1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1.
/
Then  = {1 , … , 2 N −1} is a partition of the set of all
non-empty subsets of S. For any node u, define
A iu =

∑ Pr [ | 1]C ( , ),
u

u

i

∈Ψ

where Pru[ | 1] denotes the probability that the leaf
configuration under u is  given that the true state at
u is 1, and C u (i , ) denotes the probability that the
reconstructed set at u from  is i . By this definition,
N
N −1
r
r
UA = A1 and AA = ∑ k =1 k −1 1 A 2k −1 .
k
For any node u, let the reconstructed state set be Bu.
Then for any B ∈ i , BZ = B if and only if: (1) BX ∩ BY
= B, or (2) B X ∩ B Y = ∅ and BX ∪ B Y = B. Thus A iZ
can be calculated from the reconstruction accuracies on
node X and Y in conjunction with the substitution or
conservation probabilities along the two branches ZX
and ZY (see Additional File 1 for details). Recurrence
formulas for 2-state models can be found in [22-27].
We present the recurrence system and initial conditions
for N-state models in Additional File 1. To facilitate our
study, we also implemented a computer program which
takes a phylogenetic tree in Newick format and the substitution rate along branches as inputs. The phylogenetic
tree can be inferred by methods like Neighbor-Joining
[31] and the substitution rate can also be estimated, see
for example [32]. A potential application of our algorithm and program is to select the subsets of taxa to
accurately reconstruct ancestral sequences such as
DNAs and proteins.

Results and Discussion
As the reconstruction accuracies of the Fitch algorithm
depend largely on the topology of phylogenetic trees, we
focused our attention on two extremal tree shapes: complete binary trees which are the most balanced trees and
comb-shaped trees (caterpillars), the most unbalanced
trees. We are interested in trees with many taxa and in
our results and figures we choose sufficiently many taxa
to exhibit the asymptotic behavior. In order to simulate
more realistic evolutionary scenarios, we also generated
and analyzed 1000 Yule trees with 1024 leaves.
Reconstruction Accuracies for Equal-branch Complete
Binary Trees

Let Tn be the equal-branch complete binary tree of 2n
leaves in which the substitution probability is p on each
branch, and thus the conservation probability is q = 1 (N - 1)p. Since the subtree rooted at each child of the
root r is the complete binary tree of 2n - 1 leaves, the
recurrence system to calculate the reconstruction

Page 4 of 9

accuracy can be simplified (see Additional File 2). We
simulated the obtained system by Matlab and studied
the asymptotic properties of ambiguous and unambiguous reconstruction accuracy by using all taxa as well as
by using a root-to-leaf path. The results for N = 2, 4, 5
and 20 are plotted in Figure 1.
Similar to the 2-state case in [24], we observed that for
N = 4, 5 and 20: (1) UA or AA on a root-to-leaf path is
always less than or equal to AA on all the terminal taxa,
and (2) UA or AA on a root-to-leaf path is greater than
UA on all terminal taxa when q is small but becomes
smaller than that when q is larger than a threshold. We
conjecture that the two properties hold for arbitrary
number of states.
It is shown in [25,27] that for 2-state models, UA and
AA diverge when q < 1 and converge to 1 and 1 ,
8
3
2
respectively, when 1 ≤ q ≤ 7 , as n tends towards infinity.
8
8
Surprisingly, we observed that the divergent interval
vanishes for more than two states. In addition, in an
1
interval [0, b] AA converges to N , the probability of
randomly picking a state. A possible reason is that in
the 2-state scenario, the node state changes alternatingly
with the increase of the level in complete binary trees.
As a result, both UA and AA are alternating and thus
divergent. However, their even and odd series converge
to different limits (see [25,27]). For more-state models,
the alternating property vanishes since there are more
states to travel. If q is not very large, the probability for
a node state to be one specific state becomes randomized as the level increases. Consequently, both UA and
1
AA are convergent and AA converges to N . Clearly,
b is a very important parameter. We listed in Table 1
the estimated values of b for N = 2, ..., 25. Table 1
shows that b decreases with the increase of N and it
seems to converge to a number between 0.7 and 0.76.
We offer the following explanation why more states
make it easier for the Fitch algorithm to be better than
random: with increasing number of states and constant
conservation probability it is less likely that there are
independent mutations from the root state to the same
non-root state. Instead, it will happen more often that
there are independent mutations from the root state to
different non-root states. The latter situation makes it
easier for the Fitch algorithm to reconstruct the ancestral state correctly. For example, if the reconstructed
state sets at the children of an interior vertex Z are {1,
i} and {1, j} (with I, j ≠ 1), respectively, then the set
reconstructed at Z is {1, i} if i = j and just {1} otherwise.
It seems that this advantage of many states is stronger
than the disadvantage of less frequent backwards mutations to the root state which are lucky for ancestral
reconstruction.
In summary, when q ≤ b the performance of the Fitch
method is as poor as randomly picking a state. Only when

q > b, the Fitch method could be used to reconstruct
ancestral states and the performance improves quickly
with the increase of q. As a conclusion, conservation probability is the most important factor to determine the performance of the Fitch method. The method is reliable only
when q is large, which indicates that the taxa are highly
similar. However, as we know, when taxa are not similar,
no reconstruction method performs good, so more effort

should be made in developing a reliable method in this
scenario. A suggestion for ancestral reconstruction is that,
instead of treating all taxa as a whole, one first reconstructs subset of very similar taxa and make use of the
reconstructed ancestral sequences to infer the ancestor of
the whole taxa set.
Reconstruction Accuracies on Comb-shaped Trees

Due to their extreme unbalanceness, comb-shaped trees
(or rooted caterpillars) are widely studied. A combshaped tree is a rooted binary tree where every internal
node is adjacent to at least one leaf node. We studied
two comb-shaped trees as shown in Figure 2. The tree in
Figure 2 is called equal-branch comb-shaped tree, which
assumes that substitution happens mostly at speciation
events and thus each branch length can be considered as
equal. The other tree is called Hennigian comb-shaped
tree, which assumes that substitution occurs continuously
during the course of evolution. More precisely, we
assume that all interior edges have the same length and
all leaves are equally far away from the root.
Equal-branch Comb-shaped Trees

In this tree, a descendant leaf X of the root is closer in
evolutionary distance than other leaves. Let the substitution probability of any kind along any branch be p.
Since the left subtree of the root is a branch and the
right subtree is a repeat of the tree with one leaf less,
the recurrence formula can be obtained by substituting
X
A iZ = A in , A iY = A in −1 for i = 1,  , 2N − 1, A1 = 1 and
X
for j ≠ 1. We simulated the obtained system by
Aj = 0
Matlab and studied the asymptotic properties. The
results for N = 2, 4, 5 and 20 are plotted in Figure 3.

An interesting observation is that, in contrast to complete binary trees, there is no interval of conservation
1
probability such that AA converges to N for any equalbranch comb-shaped tree. A possible reason is that the
leaves that are close to the root dominate the reconstruction accuracy and their distances to the root do not
increase with time. In addition, the limiting AA using the
nearest root-to-leaf path is always greater than that using
1
all taxa if conservation probability is larger than N .
Hennigian Comb-shaped Trees

Clearly, complete binary tree and Hennigian combshaped tree are the two kinds of extremal ultrametric
trees. By comparing the reconstruction accuracies on
both trees with those on real evolutionary trees, one can
examine which extremal trees are more realistic. Under
the Jukes-Cantor model, for a Hennigian comb tree in
which each branch has its own length l, the substitution
1
1
probability is p = N − N e − N l , and the conservation prob1
−
ability is q = 1 − (N − 1)p = N + NN 1 e − N l , where l is the
substitution rate. Similarly, the recurrence system to calculate UA of the Fitch algorithm along the Hennigian
tree can be derived from the general recurrence relations.
An observation from the recurrence system is that AA
1
is always convergent to N . As an indication, the Fitch
algorithm is not suitable for ancestral reconstruction on
evolutionary trees with shape similar to Hennigian
comb-shaped trees with many taxa. In addition, UA is
N N −2
convergent to
N
(N − 1)! (See Additional File 3

Reconstruction Accuracies for Yule Trees with 1024
Leaves

As can be seen from Figure 4, the 1000 randomly generated Yule trees show the same qualitative behavior as
the equal-branch complete binary tree with the same
number of leaves. That is, there is an interval [0, b] of

conservation probability q in which AA is almost equal
to the probability of randomly picking a state, when q >
b, the reconstruction accuracies are improved quickly
with the increase of q. A possible explanation is that the
number of taxa increases exponentially with the time,
and correspondingly, very long edges are rare. Another
interesting observation is that sometimes the reconstruction accuracies on the Yule trees are even higher
than those of the complete binary tree. This contradicts

the intuition that equal-branch complete binary trees
always maximize the reconstruction accuracies and
leaves an open problem which trees do so.

Conclusions
In this paper, we study the unambiguous and ambiguous reconstruction accuracy of the Fitch method. We
first present a general recurrence system as well as a
program for calculating reconstruction accuracies on
arbitrary trees. Based on the system and program, we
analyze 3 special trees under the Jukes-Cantor evolutionary model, namely equal-branch complete binary
trees, equal-branch comb-shaped trees, and Hennigian
comb-shaped trees, as well as 1000 randomly generated Yule trees to simulate real evolutionary scenarios.
From the analyses, we conclude that (1) for equalbranch complete binary trees, there always exists an
interval [0, b] of conservation probability, in which the

ambiguous reconstruction probability converges to N ,

conservation probability is greater than b, both reconstruction accuracies increase rapidly, The randomly
generated Yule trees also exhibit the same behavior,
(2) For unbalanced trees like comb-shaped trees, the
reconstruction accuracies using the nearest root-to-leaf
path are always greater than or equal to those using all
taxa. As a conclusion, more taxa are suggested for
ancestral reconstruction when the tree topology is
balanced and the sequences of taxa are highly similar,
and a few taxa close to the root are recommended
otherwise.
