Abstract
Background: Evolutionary genetics provides a rich theoretical framework for empirical studies of
phylogeography. Investigations of intraspecific genetic variation can uncover new putative species while
allowing inference into the evolutionary origin and history of extant populations. With a distribution on
four continents ranging throughout most of the Old World, Lampides boeticus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae)
is one of the most widely distributed species of butterfly. It is placed in a monotypic genus with no
commonly accepted subspecies. Here, we investigate the demographic history and taxonomic status of this
widespread species, and screen for the presence or absence of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia.
Results: We performed phylogenetic, population genetic, and phylogeographic analyses using 1799 bp of
mitochondrial sequence data from 57 specimens collected throughout the species' range. Most of the
samples (>90%) were nearly genetically identical, with uncorrected pairwise sequence differences of 0 –
0.5% across geographic distances > 9,000 km. However, five samples from central Thailand, Madagascar,
northern Australia and the Moluccas formed two divergent clades differing from the majority of samples
by uncorrected pairwise distances ranging from 1.79 – 2.21%. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that L. boeticus
is almost certainly monophyletic, with all sampled genes coalescing well after the divergence from three
closely related taxa included for outgroup comparisons. Analyses of molecular diversity indicate that most
L. boeticus individuals in extant populations are descended from one or two relatively recent population
bottlenecks.
Conclusion: The combined analyses suggest a scenario in which the most recent common ancestor of L.
boeticus and its sister taxon lived in the African region approximately 7 Mya; extant lineages of L. boeticus
began spreading throughout the Old World at least 1.5 Mya. More recently, expansion after population
bottlenecks approximately 1.4 Mya seem to have displaced most of the ancestral polymorphism
throughout its range, though at least two early-branching lineages still persist. One of these lineages, in
northern Australia and the Moluccas, may have experienced accelerated differentiation due to infection
with the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia, which affects reproduction. Examination of a haplotype
network suggests that Australia has been colonized by the species several times. While there is little
evidence for the existence of morphologically cryptic species, these results suggest a complex history
affected by repeated dispersal events.

Background
The study of speciation lies at the nexus of micro- and
macroevolution, i.e., phylogenetics and population genetics. Phylogeography, which incorporates both approaches
in a geographical context, examines the role of different
historical processes in population demography, differentiation and speciation [1]. The advent of rapid and affordable DNA sequencing over the past 15 years has catalyzed
studies on the evolutionary dynamics of populations and
the discovery of previously unrecognized morphologically cryptic species [2].
The pea blue butterfly, Lampides boeticus (L.) (Lepidoptera:
Lycaenidae), is one of the most widely distributed butterflies in the world, and is currently found across the Palaearctic region from Britain to Japan, throughout suitable
habitat in Africa, Madagascar, South East Asia, and Australia, extending eastwards to parts of Oceania including
Hawaii. It occurs in temperate, subtropical, and tropical
biomes in both lowland and montane localities, typically
in open and/or disturbed areas.
Taxonomically, L. boeticus is the only species in its genus
and has no commonly recognized subspecies, despite its
wide distribution. The larval stages feed on plants in at
least six families, although Leguminosae (particularly
Papilionoideae) is the predominant host plant taxon [3].

and garden peas (Pisum sativum) are among its preferred
host plants, and the butterfly is a crop pest in many parts
of its range [4]. Lampides boeticus is among the approximately three-quarters of butterfly species in the family
Lycaenidae that associate with ants as larvae and pupae
[5]. The species is facultatively tended by a variety of ants
throughout its range, including Camponotus spp., Iridomyrmex spp., and 'tramp' ant species including Tapinoma
melanocephalum and the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile
[6,7].
We sampled 57 L. boeticus from 39 localities on four continents (Fig. 1) to test the hypothesis that this widespread
species, as currently circumscribed, consists of more than
one genetically distinct taxon. We also used nucleotide
sequence data to further examine the genetic structure of
this species and analyze the demographic history of the
sampled populations.

Results
Phylogenetic analyses and node dating
Bayesian, maximum likelihood and parsimony phylogenetic analyses arrived at similar phylogenetic hypotheses
for the evolutionary history of L. boeticus that agreed on all
major groupings (Fig. 2B). Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
(COI) had 48 variable sites and cytochrome b (cytB) had
28, of which 35 and 17 were parsimoniously informative,
respectively. Thus, cytB was more variable – 5.35% of

nucleotide sites were variable across all samples – than
COI, in which 4.10% of nucleotide sites varied. The percentage of parsimoniously informative nucleotide sites
was also higher in cytB (3.28% vs. 2.87%), as was the
number of nucleotide sites with parsimoniously informative non-synonymous substitutions (3 vs. 0). The parsimony analysis resulted in 1,130 most parsimonious trees
with a tree score of 336. The strict consensus of these trees
differed with regard to two nodes when compared to the
tree obtained in both Bayesian and maximum likelihood

analyses (Fig. 2B). Lampides boeticus was monophyletic
with regard to the three chosen outgroup species. In addition to the divergent genotypes in clades C and D (Fig.
2B), there were two other groups that were supported by
Bayesian, maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses.
Clade A contained all haplotypes from Africa, Madagascar, the eastern and western Palaearctic, Indo-Burma, and
the Philippines not found in the divergent clades C and D.

ian regions not found clades C and D. Only samples 26
and 56 from clade D were infected with Wolbachia as
determined by PCR assay.
Divergence of Lampides from its putatively closest relative,
Cacyreus, occurred in the Miocene approximately 6.9 ± 0.6
Mya (node I; Fig. 2B). Divergence of clade D, containing
haplotypes from north Queensland and the Moluccas
(node II), occurred in the Pleistocene approximately 1.5 ±
0.2 Mya, and clade A and grade B, containing the majority
of haplotypes (node III), diverged approximately 1.4 ± 0.2
Mya (Fig. 2B). However, given the relative paucity of
genetic variation and the small magnitude of the difference of the inferred ages of nodes (both of which are likely
to increase error), these age estimates should be regarded
as approximations.
Pairwise distances among L. boeticus COI+cytB haplotypes
ranged from 0–2.36% (Table 1), while distances between
L. boeticus and the outgroup taxa ranged from 7.09–
10.78% (data not shown). The relatively low levels of
intraspecific sequence divergence among populations are
consistent with the hypothesis that L. boeticus is a single
species with pairwise genetic distances well below the
upper ranges of intraspecific divergence estimates found
in other lepidopteran species [8,9].
Translated amino acid sequences were invariant within
COI, but 16 changes at 8 sites were observed in cytB.
McDonald and Kreitman tests found no evidence of natural selection acting on these mitochondrial genes (P >
0.20 in all possible pairwise tests).
Perhaps the most striking pattern in the data was the paucity of genetic variation across vast geographic distances.
Our analyses showed that Lampides boeticus is a widely distributed and apparently panmictic species with little population differentiation. The most common COI+cytB
haplotype was shared by specimens from Spain, Turkey,
Kenya, Namibia, Madagascar, Laos, and Vietnam, spanning a distance of over 9,000 km or 100 longitudinal
degrees on three continents (Figs. 1, 2A, Table 1). Coalescent theory predicts that internal nodes in a gene genealogy will be more common than tip nodes, as these
represent older haplotypes. Mutations at different sites
within these ancestral haplotypes result in descendent
haplotypes that are younger and less common, and
appear as multiple 'tips' emanating from the more abundant haplotypes of the internal node [10]. This pattern
was evident in our haplotype tree (Fig. 2A). However, several samples were highly divergent from the majority of
genetically similar, yet widely distributed haplotypes.
These samples could not be connected to the others with
a 90% parsimony connection limit in the COI+cytB network (the lowest parsimony value allowed by TCS 1.21;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/301

Fig. 2A). These haplotypes, corresponding to clades C and
D in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2B), were joined to
very different sister haplotypes in the networks of COI and
cytB, and with lower parsimony connection limits [see
Additional file 1]. In these networks for individual genes,
the divergent samples were on relatively long braches,
with a haplotype from central Thailand closely related to
a sample from Madagascar in clade C. Clade D contained
a single sample from north Queensland, Australia, and
differed at only two nucleotide sites from a haplotype
shared by two samples from the Wallacean islands of
Buton and Tomea in the Moluccas to the east of Sulawesi.
Interestingly, other samples collected from the same sites
in Tomea and Madagascar grouped with the bulk of genetically similar samples (e.g., samples 14, 15, and 25 in
clade A and grade B, Fig. 2, Additional file 1), indicating
substantial genetic diversity within these populations
(e.g., 2.04% within Madagascar). In the phylogenetic
analyses, these lineages appear to have diverged earlier
than the more common genotypes (Fig. 2B). It is unlikely
that these haplotypes are nuclear copies of the mitochondrial genes (numts), since all sequences could be translated into amino acids with no stop codons. In addition,
both genes from the five specimens in clades C and D
were amplified and sequenced twice to minimize the
probability of human error.
Demographic and population genetic analyses
Indices of molecular diversity, results of Tajima's D and
Fu's F tests, and output from the mismatch distribution
analysis including estimated time since population bottlenecks are provided in Table 2. Grant and Bowen [11] suggested that comparison of h and π values within clades can
provide information about patterns of past demographic
expansion and/or constriction. They categorized numerical values of h and π as either high or low, and described
situations that may have lead to each of four possible scenarios. In our data set, h and π values of COI and cytB
from clade A and grade B considered separately or
together all fall into category 2, with high h (> 0.5) and
low π (< 0.005), indicating rapid expansion after a period
of low effective population size. All values of Fu's F statistic revealed significantly negative deviations from mutation-drift equilibrium (note that, in Fu's F analysis, P =
0.02 is the threshold value corresponding to α = 0.05)
[12]. In addition, Tajima's D statistic was significantly
negative for COI data from clade A and marginally nonsignificant for cytB data in the same clade, indicating deviation from neutral evolution and suggestive of demographic expansion.

Mismatch distributions are frequency distributions of the
number of nucleotide differences in all pairwise comparisons. A population that has experienced sudden exponential growth from an initially small population is expected

Number of samples (n), number of haplotypes (No.), number of polymorphic nucleotide sites (S), average number of nucleotide differences (k) and
variance, haplotype diversity (h) and standard deviation, and nucleotide diversity (π) and standard deviation calculated for each gene in the two
largest and most widespread clades of Lampides boeticus. Tajima's D and Fu's F test statistics with probability values for deviation from neutral

divergence rates are not available for the calculation of time since expansion. Significant P values are bold.

to have a unimodal mismatch distribution resulting from
coalescence of haplotypes to the same bottleneck event
[13,14]. In clade A and grade B, deviations of the observed
distributions of nucleotide frequencies were not significantly different from those expected under a model of
stepwise expansion (Table 2), and visual inspection of the
mismatch distributions (Fig. 3) indicate that the unimodal distributions of both genes in clade A are highly suggestive of a bottleneck, while the bimodal distributions of
both genes in grade B suggest that the initial population
size was larger before the expansion. This difference
between clade A and grade B is reflected in differences
between the pre- and post-expansion values of θ or the
COI data, though this difference is not evident in the θ
values calculated from the shorter cytB sequence fragment
(Table 2). The estimated age of the bottleneck in clade A
is more recent than that of grade B (Table 2), reflecting the
more recent divergence of clade A in the estimated phylogeny. The estimated age of the bottleneck for the pair of
clades, 2.30 My, predates the estimated divergence time of
all extant L. boeticus 1.5 Mya (Fig. 2B), suggesting methodological discrepancy between the methods used to date
divergence times and those used to estimate time since
expansion. These differing estimates are no doubt affected
by the inflated estimate of time since expansion due to the
lack of a value for μ expressed in generations rather than
years (see Methods).
Beerli [15] provided evidence from analyses of simulated
data that Bayesian methods of population parameter estimation are more likely to provide accurate estimates than
maximum likelihood methods. However, our estimations
of the parameters θ and g using both methods are remarkably concordant. The analyses suggest that the populations constituting grade B are larger than those composing

clade A, and that grade B has a higher exponential growth
rate than clade A (Table 3).
With the exceptions of L. boeticus and the species Cacyreus
marshalli, which feeds on geraniums and recently underwent a range extension as an invasive species into southern Europe from Africa [16], all species in each of the
genera closely related to Lampides are confined to the African region, with some species also present in Madagascar.
Tracing the most parsimonious reconstruction of biogeographic regions on the given tree indicates that the most
recent common ancestor of L. boeticus and its sister taxon
lived in the African region. However, the optimization for
the L. boeticus node is ambiguous, with an African origin
being only one of several most parsimonious optimizations. The genus Harpendyreus was placed in the same section as Cacyreus by Eliot [17], implying a close
relationship with Lampides, but was not sampled in the
phylogenetic reconstruction of the Polyommatini. However, Harpendyreus is wholly African, and its absence does
not affect our inferences.

Discussion
The phylogeographic structure of Lampides boeticus was
remarkable in two respects. While most sampled populations had little or no genetic variation across half the
planet, a small number of specimens from widely spaced
locales were highly divergent from the most common
haplotypes, yet relatively similar to each other.
As currently circumscribed, L. boeticus appears to be
monophyletic with respect to the outgroups included in
this analyses, and is nested within a wholly African clade.
While we acknowledge the possibility that some extant
species may have relictual distributions, it seems plausible

– given the number of exclusively African close relatives –
that the most recent common ancestor from which Lampides and its sister taxon evolved originated in Africa and
spread eastward across the Old World. Descendants from
early expansion events (clades C and D) appear to have
been largely replaced throughout much of the range by
descendants from expansion events after one or more
recent bottlenecks (clade A and grade B).
The low genetic divergence among most members of this
species could be the result of either recent and rapid population expansion after a population bottleneck or selection acting on some portion of the mitochondrial
genome. These explanations are not mutually exclusive,
but the weight of evidence suggests that most extant populations of L. boeticus have descended from expansion
after one or more bottlenecks. Results from Fu's F and
Tajima's D tests, analyses of mismatch distributions, and
comparison of h and π values all suggest rapid expansion
after a population bottleneck, with populations in clade A
from Africa, Madagascar, the Palaearctic, and the Philippines resulting from a more severe population constriction than populations in grade B from Sundaland,
Wallacea, and Australia. Moreover, since sampling was
random with respect to genotype, the larger number of
post-bottleneck haplotypes in clade A and grade B suggests that these individuals have a selective advantage over
individuals from clades C and D, perhaps because they
displaced most of the individuals from these basal lineages or because they are more effective dispersers or colonizers. Our data, however, cannot rule out the possibility
that genetic drift is responsible for the predominance of
haplotypes in clade A and grade B. Since L. boeticus is a
polyphagous crop pest, human agriculture or commerce
may have aided the rapid movement of the species around
the globe by inadvertently transporting it with crop plants
or produce. However, we suspect this factor has been minimal or geographically restricted, as no individuals from
clade A were found in the areas inhabited by individuals
from grade B, and vice versa.
Inspection of haplotype networks from individual and
concatenated genes (Fig. 2A, Additional file 1) further suggest that Australia has been colonized by L. boeticus at least
three times: once by an ancestor of the genetically divergent individual in clade D (specimen 56), once from a lin-

eage originating in Wallacea (specimens 55 and 57), and
at least once by a lineage from Sundaland (specimen 53).
A selective sweep acting on some portion of the mitochondrial genome might also explain the paucity of
genetic variation in clade A and grade B. Zink [18] has
shown that natural selection on a transmembrane portion
of the mitochondrial ND2 gene is responsible for the shallow and unstructured haplotype trees of Parus montanus
(Aves: Paridae), and similar selective forces on one or
more mitochondrial gene(s) could account for the pattern
observed in L. boeticus. However, MacDonald and Kreitman tests reveal no evidence for selection acting on the
genes sequenced for this study.
Infection by Wolbachia spp., a group of rickettsial endocellular bacteria that manipulate host reproduction in a variety of ways, can spread rapidly throughout contiguous
populations, purging genetic variation of the host species
and causing a so-called 'Wolbachia sweep' [19] capable of
reducing haplotype diversity within populations and
whole species [20]. However, none of the samples in clade
A, grade B, and clade C tested positive for Wolbachia infection, though two of the three samples (26 and 56) in clade
D were infected. The uninfected specimen in this clade
was from a dried specimen of unknown age purchased
from a dealer who could not provide the collection date,
and may also have been infected, but the Wolbachia DNA
was too degraded to be amplified in the PCR test
employed here.
Four lines of evidence suggest that all L. boeticus populations sampled in this study belong to a single, potentially
interbreeding species: 1) even the highest L. boeticus
intraspecific pairwise distance values are within the range
of intraspecific variation recorded from other butterfly
species; 2) monophyly of all sampled populations is well
supported (100% by every measure of clade support); 3)
the lack of external morphological differences among
populations; and 4) estimated divergence time of all sampled L. boeticus genes (approximately 1.5 Mya using a
dated node on the phylogeny or 2.3 Mya using coalescence time of COI) is more recent than the estimated
divergence of Lampides from its putative sister genus
Cacyreus 6.9 Mya. There are many caveats to using pairwise genetic distances and a molecular clock to infer the

Page 9 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:301

age of lineage splitting events [21]. These ages must thus
remain speculative and, in the case of L. boeticus, cannot
be confirmed by biogeographic or fossil evidence.
The haplotypes in clades C and D are most likely
descended from basal lineages that diverged before the
putative population bottleneck(s) that gave rise to clade A
and grade B. Descendents of these bottlenecks seem to
have largely displaced earlier lineages throughout the species' range. The relatively large number of synapomorphies that unite the haplotypes in clade C and clade D
renders convergence unlikely, and the geographical distances between haplotypes in these clades – particularly
between the Thai and Malagasy specimens in clade C –
makes dispersal an unlikely explanation. The presence of
these early-diverging clades, in conjunction with the
inferred demographic history of clade A and grade B, suggest a demographic history profoundly affected by the
species' propensity to undertake regional migrations [2224].
The low genetic diversity of Lampides boeticus in clade A
and grade B across its geographic range is similar to that of
several other Old World lepidopteran crop pests. Like L.
boeticus, the haplotype network of Helicoverpa armigera
(Noctuidae) has a comparatively long branch, but the
cluster of haplotypes at the end of this branch belong to a
separate species, H. zea, which is morphologically distinguishable only by close examination of the genitalia [25].
The population parameters of θ estimated for clade A and
grade B (MLEs of 0.00418 and 0.00711, respectively)
overlap with θ values calculated for several other widespread pestiferous Lepidoptera, including H. armigera
(0.0027 – 0.0099 within western Africa and France/Portugal, respectively) [26] and Ostrinia nubilalis (Crambidae;
0.00358 – 0.0315 for different loci within France). Values
for the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Lymantriidae), are
notably lower (0.00129 – 0.00282 for Japan and mainland Asia, respectively) than for La. boeticus, but the demographic scenario inferred for Ly. dispar is remarkably
similar to that of La. boeticus: divergent lineages in widespread locales (Japan and India) are thought to represent
ancient splitting events from populations spreading
throughout Eurasia, with current European populations
harboring the most derived haplotypes [27].

Conclusion
Our analyses suggest that all populations of the butterfly
Lampides boeticus (Lycaenidae) sampled in this study
belong to a single, widespread species with a complex evolutionary history. Phylogenetic estimates suggest that the
most recent common ancestor of L. boeticus and its sister
taxon diverged in Africa in the Miocene approximately 6.9
Mya, but all extant populations coalesce to a most recent
common ancestor that lived approximately 2.3 – 1.5 Mya,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/301

near the beginning of the Pleistocene. The majority of
individuals are descended from expansion events after
one or more population bottlenecks, though some populations harbor ancestral polymorphism predating these
population constrictions. One lineage found in Northern
Australia and the Moluccas may have experienced accelerated differentiation due to infection with the rickettsial
endosymbiont Wolbachia, which infected at least 2 of 3
sampled individuals in this clade. The proclivity of L. boeticus to undergo regional migrations of unknown distance
appears to have prevented genetic differentiation due to
isolation by distance, and the species' apparent wanderlust has clearly shaped its demographic history, which is
marked by expansion and long distance dispersal following periods of small population size.

Methods
DNA sequencing and selection of genetic markers
Genomic DNA was extracted from small pieces of abdominal tissue and legs using a CTAB phenol-chloroform
extraction protocol, keeping wings and genitalia intact as
morphological vouchers. Thirty-four samples were dried,
papered specimens up to 11 years old; the bodies of all
other specimens were stored in absolute ethanol immediately after collection for molecular study. We chose two
rapidly evolving protein-coding mitochondrial genes for
our analyses: cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (cytB). The COI gene encompasses the 'Folmer
region' used in DNA barcoding, and the cytB gene, located
nearly opposite COI on the circular mitochondrial
genome [28], is among the most variable protein-encoding genes in insects (R. Meier, unpublished data). Assuming the mitochondrial genome of L. boeticus is similar in
size and organization to the lycaenid species Coreana raphaelis [28], the two genes represent two different regions
and approximately 8.5% of the mitochondrial genome.

A 1,220 bp fragment of COI was amplified, typically in
two overlapping fragments using LCO1490/Nancy and
TN2126/Hobbes primer pairs (Table 4). However, six
degraded samples had to be amplified in 3–4 fragments
using the following primer pairs: LCO1490/ButterCOIR2; DanausCOI-F3/ButterCOI-R3; ButterCOI-F4/ButterCOI-R4; and/or ButterCOI-F4/Hobbes (Table 4). The
primer pair REVCBJ/REVCB2H successfully amplified a
579 bp region of the cytB gene from all samples. Each
sample was also screened for the presence of Wolbachia, a
maternally inherited bacterial endosymbiont. The primer
pair 81F/691R has been used to amplify the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene from Wolbachia infecting a variety
of butterflies and other insects [29-31], and we used these
primers in a PCR screen for the presence of Wolbachia.
Each PCR reaction consisted of 2.5 μl 10× TaKaRa ExTaq
buffer with 20 mM MgCl2, 1.2 μl of each 10 mM primer,
1 μl 100 mM dNTPs, 0.1 μl TaKaRa ExTaq polymerase, 17

μl H20, and 2 μl template DNA, for a total reaction volume of 25 μl, which was amplified with the following
thermal cycler conditions: 3 min at 94°C followed by 35
cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 52°C (COI), 54°C
(cytB), or 55° (wsp) and 1.5 min at 72°C, and finally 5
min at 72°C. The resulting products were cleaned with
Bioline SureClean, labelled with ABI BigDye Terminator
3.1, cleaned with Agencourt CleanSEQ, and sequenced in
both directions on an ABI 3130xl DNA analyzer.

resampling [34] implementing a traditional search with
33% change probability (1,000 replicates). The results
were summarized as absolute frequencies. In addition, the
data were resampled with the jackknife technique using a
traditional search with a 36% removal probability replicated 1,000 times.

Phylogenetic analyses and node dating
Alignment of nucleotide sequences, which contained no
indels, was performed with Sequencher 4.6 (Gene Codes
Corp.), and data from both genes were concatenated with
TaxonDNA 1.5 [32] for subsequent analyses. Replicate
COI+cytB sequences were pruned from the dataset so that
every haplotype in the phylogenetic analyses was unique.
Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences from three
closely related butterflies [17] were used to root the
ingroup taxa: Cacyreus marshalli, Uranothauma falkensteini,
and Phlyaria cyara. Recent molecular phylogenetic investigation of the tribe Polyommatini has shown that these
taxa are closely related to L. boeticus (N.E. Pierce et al., in
prep.). Analyses performed with and without the inclusion
of these sequences in the dataset showed that the absence
of cytB sequence data for the outgroup species had no
effect on the topology of the phylogenetic estimate for the
ingroup.

Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed with
MrBayes 3.1.2 [35]. MrModeltest 2.2 [36] selected the
GTR+I+Γ [37] model for both COI and cytB partitions
using Akaike's Information Criterion [38]. Parameter values for the substitution model were estimated from the
data and allowed to vary independently between genes.
Four Markov chains, one cold and three heated, were run
simultaneously for 10 million generations. Trees were
sampled every 100th generation. After completion of the
analysis, the first 25,000 trees were discarded before a
majority-rule consensus tree was calculated from the
remaining 75,001 trees. Maximum likelihood analyses
were performed with GARLI 0.951 [39] starting from a
random tree using the GTR model with all model parameters estimated from the data. The analysis was automatically terminated after the search algorithm progressed
10,000 generations without improving the tree topology
by a log likelihood of 0.01 or better. Maximum likelihood
bootstrap values were obtained by repeating the analysis
100 times and constructing a majority-rule consensus tree
with PAUP* 4.0b10 [40].

Parsimony analyses were performed with TNT 1.1 [33].
After increasing the maximum number of saved trees to
3,000, a traditional TBR heuristic search was implemented, performing 1,000 replicates and saving 10 trees
per replication, replacing existing trees. To assess confidence in the resulting phylogenetic estimate, the data
were subjected to a bootstrap analysis using symmetric

The most parsimonious haplotype network of L. boeticus
was determined with TCS 1.21 [41]. Analyses were run
multiple times with varying parsimony connection limits
to ascertain the highest limit that would retain each connection. The haplotype networks of each gene and of the
two concatenated genes were determined separately.

at the ends of sequences and lack of overlap between forward and reverse strands were coded as missing data.
These missing data caused only minor problems; only two
sequences had missing values for three of the fifty-two
parsimoniously variable sites. Anastomoses due to convergence of mutations at two or more nucleotide sites
were pruned using the guidelines of Castelloe and Templeton [10] to produce strictly bi- or multifurcating topologies. Nested clade phylogeographic analysis was also
performed to evaluate population histories of L. boeticus.
The results of these analyses are presented in Additional
file 1.
In the absence of a robust fossil record and/or vicariance
events with which to calibrate divergence times, we estimated divergence times using a molecular clock (e.g.
[42]). Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) exhibits the
least rate homogeneity of any insect mitochondrial gene
[43], and age estimations were based only on this gene,
which shows an average mean uncorrected pairwise distance of 1.5% per million years (My) across a range of
arthropod taxa [44]. Mean uncorrected pairwise distances
between all samples on each branch of major bifurcating
nodes were calculated with MEGA 4 [45] and divided by
0.015 (1.5%) to obtain a rough estimate of node age.
Demographic and population genetic analyses
To examine the evolutionary histories of sampled populations, we calculated several population genetic diversity
indices that allow inference about demographic history.
Identical sequences were not removed from the dataset for
these analyses. Given the low levels of genetic variation
and the paucity of samples at individual sampling sites,
we grouped samples by clade (Fig. 2B) and provide separate analyses for clade A, grade B, and clade A + grade B,
which, together, form a monophyletic group. We calculated the following population genetic indices using
DnaSP [46]: number of haplotypes, number of variable
nucleotide sites (S), haplotype diversity (h) and its standard deviation, nucleotide diversity (π) and its standard
deviation, and the mean number of pairwise differences
(k), along with its total variance (including components
of stochastic and sampling variance) [47]. The haplotype
diversity of a sample indicates the probability that two
randomly chosen haplotypes within a sample will be
identical [equation 8.5, [48]], while nucleotide diversity
calculates the average proportion of nucleotide sites that
differ in all pairwise comparisons [47]. In addition, the
genetic imprint of rapid population expansion can be
detected with Tajima's D test [49,50], Fu's F-test [12], and
by inspection of mismatch distributions, which plot the
frequency distribution of observed pairwise differences
[13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/301

Tajima's D test, Fu's F test, and calculation of observed
and expected mismatch values were performed with Arlequin 3.11 [51], along with the moment estimators of the
time to expansion (τ), and indices of population sizes
before and after the expansion, θ0 and θ1, respectively
[52], which are calculated with a generalized non-linear
least-square approach with confidence intervals approximated with 1000 replicates of parametric bootstrapping
[53]. To assess the validity of these estimates of demographic expansion, the probability of the sum of square
deviations (SSD) between the observed mismatch values
and values predicted by the model is approximated by
determining the proportion of simulated SSDs that are
larger than or equal to the observed SSD [51]. The time
since expansion, t, is then calculated by substituting values for τ and μ in the equation τ = 2μt [51], where μ (the
mutation rate per site per generation) is 0.75% between
ancestor-descendent alleles (i.e., half of 1.5%, the average
value for arthropod pairwise differences per million years)
[44]. Note that τ is expressed in generations, while the
value of μ used here is measured in years. Since L. boeticus
passes through several generations per year, this method
of estimating time since expansion is most likely an overestimate.
The relative effective population size parameter θ and
exponential growth rate, g, as well as their 95% confidence intervals, were estimated using data from both COI
and cytB and calculated with LAMARC 2.12b [54]. The
two parameters and their confidence intervals were jointly
estimated with separate Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. Each LAMARC analysis consisted of 3
simultaneous searches with heating temperature adjusted
automatically with 15 initial chains sampled every 20
steps with a burn-in of 2000, followed by 6 final chains
sampled every 20 steps with a burn-in of 2500. Final most
likely estimates (MLEs) were calculated using parameter
estimates from three replicated analyses.
To infer the geographical origin of L. boeticus, we connected our haplotype tree to a well-sampled, genus-level
phylogenetic hypothesis for the tribe Polyommatini based
on 4939 bp from seven nuclear and mitochondrial genes.
Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods both recovered the following topology for L. boeticus and closely
related genera: (((Lampides, Cacyreus) Actizera)(Phlyaria,
Uranothauma)) (N.E. Pierce et al., in prep.). We coded the
biogeographic distributions of each taxon in this phylogeny as a character and traced the most parsimonious
reconstruction of biogeographic regions on the tree using
MacClade 4.06 [55] to assess the probable region where L.
boeticus and its most recent common ancestor diverged.
MacClade was also used to translate DNA sequences to
amino acids for tabulation of non-synonymous substitutions. PAUP* 4.0b10 was used to calculate mean pairwise

performed with DnaSP.
