Abstract
Background: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleocapsid (NC) plays a pivotal
role in the viral lifecycle: including encapsulating the viral genome, aiding in strand transfer during
reverse transcription, and packaging two copies of the viral genome into progeny virions. Another
gag gene product, p6, plays an integral role in successful viral budding from the plasma membrane
and inclusion of the accessory protein Vpr within newly budding virions. In this study, we have
characterized the gag NC and p6 genes from six mother-infant pairs following vertical transmission
by performing phylogenetic analysis and by analyzing the degree of genetic diversity, evolutionary
dynamics, and conservation of functional domains.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of 168 gag NC and p6 genes sequences revealed six separate
subtrees that corresponded to each mother-infant pair, suggesting that epidemiologically linked
individuals were closer to each other than epidemiologically unlinked individuals. A high frequency
(92.8%) of intact open reading frames of NC and p6 with patient and pair specific sequence motifs
were conserved in mother-infant pairs' sequences. Nucleotide and amino acid distances showed a
lower degree of viral heterogeneity, and a low degree of estimates of genetic diversity was also
found in NC and p6 sequences. The NC and p6 sequences from both mothers and infants were
found to be under positive selection pressure. The two important functional motifs within NC, the
zinc-finger motifs, were highly conserved in most of the sequences, as were the gag p6 Vpr binding,
AIP1 and late binding domains. Several CTL recognition epitopes identified within the NC and p6
genes were found to be mostly conserved in 6 mother-infant pairs' sequences.
Conclusion: These data suggest that the gag NC and p6 open reading frames and functional
domains were conserved in mother-infant pairs' sequences following vertical transmission, which
confirms the critical role of these gene products in the viral lifecycle.

Background
Mother-to-infant (vertical) transmission of HIV-1 occurs

at a rate of 30%, and accounts for 90% of infections in
children worldwide. Transmission of the virus can occur

at three stages: prepartum (in utero), intrapartum (during
birth), and postpartum (breast feeding). Several factors
have been linked to vertical transmission including: low
CD4 count and high viral load of the mother, advanced
maternal disease status, invasive procedures, infections
during pregnancy and prolonged exposure of the infant to
blood and ruptured membranes during birth [1-8]. The
exact molecular mechanisms of vertical transmission are
not well understood, however we and others have shown
that the minor HIV-1 genotypes are transmitted from
mother to infant [9,10]. It has also been shown that the
macrophage-tropic (R5) phenotype is involved in transmission [11]. Analysis of several HIV-1 accessory and regulatory genes, including vif, vpr, vpu, nef, tat and rev has
revealed conservation of functional domains of these
genes during vertical transmission [12-17]. In addition,
transmitting mothers' vif and vpr sequences were more
heterogeneous and the functional domain more conserved than non-transmitting mothers' sequences [12-17].
However, other HIV-1 genes may also play a crucial role
in virus transmission and pathogenesis.
One such gene product, the gag nucleocapsid (NC) plays
a pivotal role in the viral lifecycle, including encapsulating
the viral genome, aiding in the reverse transcription process, protecting the viral genome from nuclease digestion
and packaging two copies of the viral genome into progeny virions [18-23]. The NC gene product, also termed p7,
is translated as a Pr55 Gag precursor and when cleaved is
55 amino acids long. It contains one major functional
domain, consisting of two zinc finger like motifs. These
motifs allow the NC to bind the packaging signal, or Ψ
site, on viral RNA, as well as coat the viral genome
[18,24,25]. They contain the sequence C-X2-C-X4-H-X4-C
with the critical residues consisting of three cystines and
one histidine [20]. When these critical zinc binding
amino acids are mutated to non-zinc binding residues, it
results in virions that are defective in RNA packaging and
replication [18,21,26]. Several basic amino acid residues
throughout the NC gene product are also associated with
RNA binding, and aid in NC function [18,21]. These basic
residues are responsible for interaction with the side
chains of the viral nucleic acids. NC plays several roles
during the reverse transcription step of the HIV-1 lifecycle.
It is responsible for ensuring proper annealing of the tRNALys primer to the primer binding site to initiate reverse
transcription, and also aids in strand transfer so that
reverse transcription can continue [20,21,23,27,28]. During and after reverse transcription, it has been shown that
NC binds to the newly generated viral DNA and protects
it from cellular nucleases until it can integrate into the
host cell genome [22,29]. Due to the importance of this
gene any alterations to the NC may affect transmission
and pathogenesis of the virus.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/21

Another example of a crucial gene product is p6, which
plays an integral role in successful viral budding from the
plasma membrane and inclusion of the accessory protein
Vpr within newly budding virions [30-35]. The p6 gene
product is also initially translated as a Pr55 Gag precursor
and is 52aa long when cleaved by the viral protease. The
p6 protein contains a viral late (L) domain with the
sequence PTAPP, which is necessary for viral budding
[36,37]. It has been shown that the late domain interacts
with the host cell factor Tsg101 which is involved in regulating intracellular trafficking [32,35,38,39]. The late
domain has also been shown to be crucial for detachment
of virions from the host cell surface. Defects and mutations in the late domain can result in chains of immature
virions that cannot release from the host cell surface
[36,40]. The p6 gene product also contains a region with
the sequence DKELYPLASLRSLFG that is responsible for
interacting with the host cell factor AIP1 [31,41,42]. AIP1
has been shown to interact with Tsg101 and host factor
ESCRT-III to function in a late-acting endosomal sorting
complex that is essential for viral budding [31,41-43].
There are two domains that could possibly be required for
inclusion of Vpr, either the FRFG domain [30] or the
(LXX)4 domain [33,34,44,45]. Defects within the Vpr
binding domains could result in virions that lack Vpr. This
would affect the ability of the virus, upon infection, to
replicate in nondividing cells such as macrophages, and
would affect the ability of the viral DNA to localize to the
host cell nucleus for integration. The p6 gene product is
also critical in the viral lifecycle, and therefore any
changes within it may effect the transmission and pathogenesis of the virus.
In this study, we have characterized and analyzed the
genetic diversity and population dynamics of the gag NC
and p6 genes from six mother-infant pairs following vertical transmission. Our findings suggest that these gene
products are mostly conserved during mother-infant
transmission. Furthermore, the critical functional
domains were conserved in most sequences analyzed.
These results help to further our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms that are involved in vertical transmission of HIV-1.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of NC and p6 sequences from
mother-infant pairs
Multiple independent polymerase chain reactions (PCRs)
were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC) DNA from six mother-infant pairs, a total of 13
patients including one mother who gave birth to HIV-1
positive twins. Eight to eighteen clones from each patient
were obtained and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis
was performed using a neighbor-joining tree of the 168
NC and p6 sequences from the mother-infant pairs (Fig.

Phylogenetic analysis of 168 HIV-1 NC and p6 sequences from six mother-infant pairs; pairs B, C, D, E, F, and H. The neighborjoining tree is based on the distance calculated between the nucleotide sequences from the six mother-infant pairs. Each terminal node represents one sequence. The values on the branches represent the occurrence of that branch over 1,000 bootstrap
resamplings. Each pair formed a distinct subtree, and within each subtree the mother and infant sequences were generally separated into clusters, although some intermingling was observed. The formation of subtrees indicated that epidemiologically
linked mother-infant pairs were closer to each other evolutionarily than to epidemiologically unlinked pairs, and that there was
no PCR cross-contamination. The placement of the HIV-1 lab control strain NL4-3 indicates that no PCR contamination
occurred.

Figure sequence alignment of deduced amino acids of NC and p6 from mother-infant pairs B and C
Multiple2
Multiple sequence alignment of deduced amino acids of NC and p6 from mother-infant pairs B and C. Within the alignment, the
top sequence is the NC consensus B (ConBNC) sequence to which the mother-infant pair sequences are compared. Each line
of the alignment represents one clone sequence, and is identified by a clone number with M referring to mother and I referring
to infants. The dots represent agreement with the consensus sequence, while substitutions are represented by a single letter
amino acid code. Stop codons are shown as asterisks (*). The functional domains within the sequence are indicated above the
alignment.
1). This neighbor-joining tree was generated by incorporating a best-fit model of evolution into PAUP [46], and
the resulting tree was then bootstrapped 1000 times to
ensure fidelity. Analysis of the tree demonstrated that the
sequences from the six mother-infant pairs form distinct,
well separated subtrees, and all pairs were separate from
the lab control strain HIV-1 isolate NL4-3. Within each
subtree the sequences for the mother and infant are generally well separated into subtrees, however some intermingling was observed in pairs B, D, E, and H. The
intermingling of mother-infant sequences suggests that
the isolates from these patients are very closely related,
and had not as of yet evolved to form separate, distinct
subtrees. Taken together the data indicates that epidemiologically linked (mother-infant) patient sequences are
closer to each other evolutionarily than epidemiologically
unlinked sequences. The separation of the mother-infant

sequences from each pair and NL4-3 indicates that no
PCR contamination occurred.
Coding potential of NC and p6 gene sequences
The multiple sequence alignment of the deduced amino
acid sequences of the HIV-1 NC and p6 genes is shown in
Figs. 2, 3, 4. Of the 168 sequences analyzed, 156 contained an intact open reading frame (ORF), yielding a frequency of 92.8%. This high frequency indicates that the
coding potential of the NC and p6 genes was maintained
in most of the sequences analyzed. Looking more closely,
the frequency of an intact ORF for the mothers' sequences
was 89.4%, while the infants' sequences yielded a frequency of 96.3%. Several clones within mother-infant
pair H were found to be defective due to a single nucleotide substitution, insertion or deletion, which resulted in
the formation of a stop codon. There were several patient

Figure sequence alignment of deduced amino acids of NC and p6 from mother-infant pairs D and E
Multiple3
Multiple sequence alignment of deduced amino acids of NC and p6 from mother-infant pairs D and E. Within the alignment, the
top sequence is the NC consensus B (ConBNC) sequence to which the mother-infant pair sequences are compared. Each line
of the alignment represents one clone sequence, and is identified by a clone number with M referring to mother and I referring
to infants. The dots represent agreement with the consensus sequence, while substitutions are represented by a single letter
amino acid code. Stop codons are shown as asterisks (*). The functional domains within the sequence are indicated above the
alignment.

and pair specific sequence patterns within the NC
sequences analyzed. An insertion of proline-threoninevaline (PTV) was seen in the sequences of mother-infant
pair C at position 78, and an insertion of proline-threonine-alanine-proline-proline-glutamate (PTAPPE) was
observed within several sequences of mother D at position 84. This resulted in a duplication of the PTAP motif
within this patient. An amino acid substitution was also
present in most of the sequences when compared as a
whole, a leucine (L) was replaced with a methionine (M),
valine (V), histidine (H), arginine (R) or glutamine (Q) at
position 116.

Variability of NC and p6 gene sequences in mother-infant
pairs
The nucleotide and amino acid distances, which measure
the degree of genetic variability based on pairwise comparison, were calculated for the six mother-infant pairs'
sequences (Table 2). The nucleotide sequences within
mothers B, C, D, E, F, and H varied by 0.26, 0.53, 0.84,
1.13, 0.27, and 5.04% (median values) respectively, ranging from 0 to 6.30%. The infant (B, C, D, E, F, I1H, and
I2H) sequences differed by 0, 2.59, 0.88, 1.11, 1.78, 0,
3.22% (median values) respectively, ranging from 0 to
5.03%. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence variability

Length of infection: The closest time of infection that could be documented was the first positive HIV-1 serology date or the first visit of the patient
to the AIDS treatment center, where all the HIV-1 positive patients were referred to as soon as an HIV-1 test was positive. As a result, these dates
may not reflect the exact dates of infection.
Clinical evaluation for the infants is based on CDC criteria [70]
Mother and infant samples for each pair were collected at the same time

ranged from 0 to 14.55%. The nucleotide and amino acid
sequence variability was also calculated between epidemiologically unlinked individuals. It was determined that
the nucleotide distances gave a median value of 7.68,
while the amino acid distances produced a median of
14.68. A comparison revealed that the variability between
epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs was lower
than the variability between epidemiologically unlinked
individuals. This suggests that epidemiologically linked
sequences were closer to each other evolutionarily than to
unlinked sequences.

We did not find any errors made by the Taq polymerase
when we used a known sequence of HIV-1 NL4-3 for PCR
amplification and DNA sequencing of the NC gene.
Dynamics of HIV-1 NC and p6 gene evolution in motherinfant pairs
Different models of evolution were suggested by Modeltest 3.06 [47] based on maximum likelihood estimates
and chi square tests that were performed by the program.
The estimates of genetic diversity of the NC and p6
sequences obtained were determined using the Watterson
model, which assumes segregated sites, and the Coalesce
model, which assumes a constant population size. These

We also evaluated if the low variability of NC sequences
seen in our mother-infant pair isolates was due to errors

estimates of genetic diversity are displayed as theta values,
and represent the rate of mutation per site per generation
(Table 3). The Watterson model estimated the level of
genetic diversity within infected mothers to be 0.014, and
within infected infants to be 0.015. Slightly greater estimates were obtained using the Coalesce method, with the
genetic diversity between mothers being 0.014, and
between infants 0.029. Together these data suggest that
both the mother and infant populations evolved slowly
and at similar rates. The difference between the estimates
of genetic diversity between the mother and infant
sequences, using either method, is not statistically significant.
Rates of accumulation of non-synonymous and
synonymous substitutions
The ratio of the accumulation of non-synonymous (dn) to
synonymous substitutions (ds) was used to estimate the

selection pressure on the NC and p6 gene by using a
model modified by Nielson and Yang [48], which was
then implemented by codeML [49]. The advantage of the
codeML method lies in the fact that this model views the
codon as the unit of evolution, as opposed to the nucleotide which is used in other models [50]. Moreover, the
Nielson and Yang model does not assume that all sites
within a sequence are under the same selection pressure.
This gives a more realistic view of evolution because mutations, in some cases leading to only a single amino acid
change, can be more advantageous or deleterious in some
regions of a protein compared to others, and thus undergoes positive or purifying selection. In addition the dn/ds
ratio that is calculated determines the selection pressure
acting upon the changes within the codon, with a dn/ds
ratio of greater than 1 indicating that positive selection
pressure is present. Not only does this model determine
positive selection pressure, it also calculates the percent-

Retrovirology 2006, 3:21

age of mutations that are selected. The percent of mutations that are conserved fall in the p1 category, the neutral
mutations are in the p2 category, and the positively
selected mutations are in the p3 category. The estimations
of the dn/ds ratio as well as the percentages in each category (p1, p2, and p3) for each patient sample are given in
Table 4. All of the sequence populations analyzed displayed a dn/ds ratio greater than or equal to 1.
In general, the mother sequences displayed a higher percentage of positively selected p3 sites compared to the
infants. Within mothers, almost 100% of the mutations in
mothers B, C, and F were positively selected. Although
mother D and mother H have the highest dn/ds values,
less than 1% of the mutations are positively selected. Most
of the mutations in mother D and mother H are neutral.
When compared to the mothers, infants have less than 3%
of mutations that are positively selected, with the exceptions of infant D and the second infant H twin (I2H). In
contrast to the mothers, the infants have a more even distribution of conserved and neutral mutations. It is interesting to note that in four of the seven infants, over 50%
of the mutations observed were neutral mutations. This
higher proportion of p2 sites in infants was also seen in
analysis of the nef and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes
[12,51]. The positive selection pressure acting on these
patient sequences was estimated in codeML using both
neutral models and positive selection models. In patients
where a substantial proportion of mutations were in the
p3 category, the positive selection model was significant
over the neutral model (data not shown). These data indicate that a higher percentage of mutations are positively
selected in mothers as compared to infants, however positive selection pressure was observed when analyzing the
NC gene sequences from both the mother and infant
patient samples.
Analysis of functional domains of NC and p6 within
mother-infant pairs
The function of the HIV-1 NC protein is to bind to viral
RNA and DNA. This protein contains two zinc fingers and
many basic amino acids that allow it to interact with the
viral nucleic acids. The critical residues of the zinc fingers
consist of three cysteines and one histidine, and have the
sequence C-X2-C-X4-H-X4-C, with X representing any
amino acid, and are located at positions 16 to 29 and 37
to 50 within the NC protein [20]. The critical residues
within these zinc fingers are located at positions 16, 19,
24, and 29 in the first zinc finger and positions 37, 40, 45,
and 50 in the second zinc finger. A mutation at any of
these critical residues abolishes the ability of these functional domains to bind the zinc cofactor, which will lead
to improper folding of the protein [24,29]. Analysis of the
first zinc finger sequence from the six mother-infant pairs
shows that of the 168 sequences acquired, only two con-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/21

tained mutations at the critical residues (Figs. 2, 3, 4).
Infant C clone 2 (IC-2) contained the substitution C19R,
and mother B clone 2 (MB-2) (Fig. 2) contained the substitution H24Y. Furthermore, the second zinc finger contained substitutions at the critical residues in only one
clone; infant C clone 3 (IC-3) contained an H45Y substitution (Fig. 2). However some sequences within mother H
and the second infant H twin (I2H) contain substitutions
that resulted in the formation of a stop codon at position
38 within the second zinc finger (Fig. 4). These stop
codons would result in a truncation in the second zinc finger, and would result in only one functional zinc finger
(the first zinc finger) within the NC protein of these
clones. When two zinc fingers are present, the first generally tends to play a more critical role [18,20], however
removal of the second zinc finger function has been
shown to greatly decrease the annealing capacity of the
NC protein [20,29]. Despite these exceptions, the critical
residues of both zinc fingers within the mother-infant NC
sequences were highly conserved.
There are several basic residues, arginine (R), lysine (K), or
histidine (H), within the NC protein that also allow it to
function. Of the 56 amino acids that make up the NC protein, 17 are basic [21]. These basic residues spread
throughout the protein and are responsible for interacting
with the side chains on viral nucleic acids [18,52]. Mutations in these basic residues has been shown to reduce
RNA binding and encapsidation [21]. Analysis of the
sequences from the mother-infant pairs shows that there
are substitutions at many of the basic residues. However
looking more in depth, a majority of the substitutions are
from one basic amino acid to another. Furthermore, there
are several substitutions from non-basic to basic residues
throughout the protein sequences obtained, and some of
these substitutions are compensatory mutations for
changes from a basic amino acid elsewhere within the
sequence (Figs. 2, 3, 4). While there are several substitutions involving basic amino acids within the NC protein
sequences from the six mother-infant pairs, the presence
of several basic residues throughout the protein sequences
is highly conserved.
The p6 gene was also sequenced as a result of sequencing
the NC gene. The p6 protein contains two major functional domains, the viral late domain located at positions
79 to 83, and the Vpr binding domains located at positions 87 to 90 and 107 to 118 [30,33,45]. The late domain
contains the sequence proline-threonine-alanine-prolineproline (PTAPP) and is responsible for ensuring proper
budding of a newly formed virion from the host cell membrane [32,53]. The prolines at positions 82 and 83 have
especially been shown to be critical for Tsg101 binding
[32]. Analysis of the p6 protein sequences from the six
mother-infant pairs revealed that the late domains, espe-

cially the critical prolines, are conserved in most of the
sequences obtained (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Interestingly, in several
sequences from mother D there is a duplication of the late
domain (Fig. 3). It has been shown that duplication of
this domain could be linked to antiretroviral drug resistance [54,55]. However since mother D has not been
exposed to antiretroviral drugs (Table 1), this duplication
must have arisen naturally or was present in the virus that
was initially transmitted to mother D. In general, the late
domain of the p6 protein from the mother-infant pairs
was highly conserved.
The Vpr binding domain could be located in two possible
positions within the p6 protein sequences of the six
mother-infant pairs, either positions 87 to 90 or 107 to
118 [30,33,45] (Fig. 2). The domain located at positions
87 to 107 has the sequence phenylalanine-arginine-phenylalanine-glycine (FRFG) [30], while the domain at positions 107 to 118 has the sequence leucine-XX-leucine-XXleucine-XX-leucine-XX ((LXX)4)[45], with X representing
any amino acid. These Vpr binding domains are responsible for inclusion of the viral accessory protein Vpr into
newly forming virions. Analysis of the protein sequences
from the mother-infant pairs revealed that while the FRFG
Vpr binding domain was mostly conserved, there were
some notable exceptions. There were single amino acid
substitutions within the domain in every clone of mother
and infant F (pair F), infant C (IC), and infant D (ID)
(Figs. 2, 3, 4). It has been shown that mutations at either
of the two phenylalanines within the FRFG domain,
which is seen in pair F and infant D, causes a loss of Vpr
packaging within virions; while a substitution at the

arginine site, which is seen in infant C, seems to have little
to no effect [30]. In spite of these exceptions however, the
FRFG Vpr binding domain within the six mother-infant
pairs analyzed was mostly conserved. Analyzing the protein sequences also showed that the (LXX)4 domain was
also mostly conserved within the sequences obtained,
except for the first leucine in every clone. This first leucine
was substituted with either a methionine (M), a valine
(V), a histidine (H), an arginine (R), or a glutamine (Q)
(Figs. 2, 3, 4). A change in this first leucine has been
shown to decrease Vpr binding [45]. The third and fourth
leucine have been shown to be critical for Vpr inclusion
[33,34], and these residues are highly conserved within
the mother-infant sequences obtained. As with the FRFG
domain, the (LXX)4 Vpr binding was mostly conserved
within the sequences of the mother-infant pairs analyzed.
The p6 gene product also contains a region, from amino
acid positions 31–46 with the sequence DKELYPLASLRSLFG that is responsible for interacting with the
host cell factor AIP1 [31]. This motif within the motherinfant pair sequences was mostly conserved, however
every clone analyzed contained a substitution at the first
leucine, as also seen in the (LXX)4 domain (Figs 2, 3, 4).
Mother and infant C (pair C) (Fig. 2) and mother and
infant D (pair D) (Fig. 3) also contained additional substitutions within the AIP1 binding domain. It is not
known at this time what effect these substitutions would
have on the interaction of p6 with AIP1. Despite these
exceptions, the AIP1 binding domain was mostly conserved within the six mother-infant pairs' sequences
obtained.

In addition to the substitutions mentioned, there were
several other substitutions that occurred outside of the
functional domains. The effect that these changes would
have is not known at this time.
Analysis of immunologically relevant mutations within the
CTL epitopes of NC and p6
The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response is known to
contribute a significant portion of the body's immune
response to an HIV-1 infection. In patients with a strong
CTL response, there has been shown to be a decrease in
the viral load within the patient and a long-term non-progressor disease status [56]. It has also been shown that
mothers who transmit the virus to their infants have an
increased number of CTL escape variants when compared
to non-transmitting mothers [57]. This could demonstrate a correlation between the amount of CTL escape variants circulating in the mothers' bloodstream and the
likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus. There have
been several CTL epitopes identified within the NC and
p6 proteins. The first epitope within the NC protein has
the sequence CRAPRKKGC and is located between amino
acid positions 28 and 36 [58]. This epitope is recognized
by HLA-B14 and contains the last cystine of the first zinc
finger, and the first cystine of the second zinc finger. Analysis of the NC amino acid sequences from the six motherinfant pairs revealed that this epitope was highly conserved in most of the clones that were obtained (Figs. 2, 3,
4). Another CTL epitope, KEGHQMKDCTERQANF, is
located at amino acid positions 42–57 and is recognized
by several HLA types [58]. This epitope spans the last 14
amino acids of the NC protein and contains the histidine
and final cystine of the second zinc finger. Again this
epitope was mostly conserved when the sequences from
the mother-infant pairs was analyzed. The next motif,
CTERQANFL, is located from positions 50 to 56 and is
recognized by HLA-B61 [58]. This epitope contains the
last cystine of the second zinc finger and was highly conserved within the mother-infant sequences obtained.

The first motif within the p6 gene sequences, GNFLQSRPEPTAPPF, is located at amino acid positions 70–84 and
is recognized by several HLA types [58]. Analysis of the
mother-infant sequences revealed that this epitope was
mostly conserved, with the exception of mother and
infant C (pair C). Pair C contains a PTV insertion beginning at position 78 (Fig. 2). It is not known at this time
what effect on CTL recognition this insertion would have.
The next epitope is located at amino acid positions 105 to
114 and has the sequence KELYPLTSL [58]. This epitope is
recognized by HLA-B60 and is positioned within the
(LXX)4 Vpr binding domain. Within the mother-infant
sequences obtained this CTL epitope was mostly conserved, however the first lysine within the epitope was
substituted within every clone analyzed (Figs. 2, 3, 4). It is

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/21

not known at this time what effect this substitution would
have on recognition of this epitope. Another epitope,
YPLTSLRSLF, is located at positions 108 to 117 and is recognized by HLA-B7 [58]. Analysis of the six mother-infant
pairs' sequences revealed that this epitope was mostly
conserved (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Overall, analysis of the CTL recognition epitopes within the sequences of the motherinfant pairs' displayed that these epitopes which are
involved in immune recognition of the virus were mostly
conserved.

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that the gag p17, NC and p6
genes, of HIV-1 were mostly conserved during vertical
transmission. Six mother-infant pairs were analyzed and
the NC and p6 open reading frames were found to be conserved with a frequency of 92.8%. When distance analysis
and population dynamics were performed, it was found
that there was a low degree of viral heterogeneity as well
as genetic diversity. In spite of this, a positive selection
pressure was found be to acting on the NC and p6 gene
sequences. Comparison of the mother-infant pairs to each
other revealed that the NC and p6 sequences from epidemiologically linked individuals were more closely related
to each other than to epidemiologically unlinked individuals. While the individual pairs could clearly be distinguished from one another based on sequence analysis, the
functional domains within all sequences analyzed
remained mostly conserved. These findings suggest that
maintenance of conserved NC and p6 genes during vertical transmission is important for pathogenesis of HIV-1 in
mothers and infants.
The open reading frames (ORF) of the NC and p6 genes
sequenced from six mother-infant pairs involved in vertical transmission were highly conserved. Of the 168
sequences analyzed, 156 contained an intact ORF (Fig 2).
The remaining sequences contained a substitution that
resulted in the formation of a premature stop codon. This
data is comparable to previously analyzed genes, including gag p17, vif, vpr, tat, vpu, nef, and reverse transcriptase
[12-16,51,59,60]. Maintenance of the NC and p6 ORFs
confirms the importance of this gene in the viral lifecycle,
and suggests its importance in vertical transmission of the
virus.
Several pair and patient specific sequence motifs were
observed when a multiple sequence alignment was performed. There were also three substitutions that were
present in every sequence analyzed (Figs 2, 3, 4). These
universal mutations could provide a possible target for
future diagnosis or for antiretroviral therapy development. The NC has already become a promising target for
antiviral therapy [24,61-63], perhaps the information that
this study provides can help further the knowledge of

HIV-1 vertical transmission and help to design preventative methods. Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid
distances revealed a low degree of viral heterogeneity
within the sequences analyzed (Fig 3). A low degree of
genetic diversity was also found by the Watterson and
Coalesce methods (Fig 4). The mutation rate per site per
generation (the θ value) was slightly, although not significantly, higher in infants than in mothers. This slight
increase in mutation rate could account for the slightly
higher heterogeneity within the infant sequences. These
values could be higher within the infants due to the fact
that the virus within the infants has had less time to adapt
to its new host than in the mothers. This is also supported
by the observation that mothers have a higher percentage
of mutations that are positively selected as compared to
infants, where most of the mutations were neutral or conserved. A higher percentage of positively selected mutations could indicate that the virus has evolved for a longer
duration in the mothers. Since it is likely that the infants
have been infected for a shorter duration than the mothers, the viral variants in the infants have been exposed to
the selection pressure of the new host for a shorter time.
Although the distance values indicate that the infants were
slightly more diverse, phylogenetic analysis reveals that
each of the six mother-infant pairs clustered together in
distinct subtrees (Fig 1). This reveals that although the
virus is evolving in separate hosts, it is still more similar to
the virus in its epidemiologically linked host, than to the
virus in an epidemiologically unlinked host. Information
of this kind can be helpful in establishing an epidemiological relationship between transmitter-recipient pairs.
The functional domains in the NC and p6 genes from the
six mother-infant pairs were mostly conserved during vertical transmission. The critical residues of the NC zinc fingers were highly conserved, while the basic residues
throughout the NC protein displayed more variability.
However, these changes within the basic residues did not
result in an overall loss of these basic amino acids. In fact,
most of the basic amino acids that were substituted were
replaced by another basic residue. While some changes
did result in a loss of a basic residue, other compensatory
mutations elsewhere in the amino acid sequence replaced
the residue lost. This conservation of critical zinc finger
residues and presence of many basic residues implies that
it is very important to the virus evolutionarily to maintain
the function these motifs provide. The viral late domain,
Vpr binding sites, and AIP1 binding site were all mostly
conserved as well, when the mother-infant p6 sequences
were analyzed. Critical residues within the late domain,
including the two prolines vital for Tsg101 binding, were
highly conserved during vertical transmission. This
domain was not only conserved, but duplicated within
some mother D sequences. It has been shown that duplication of this domain could be linked to antiretroviral

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/21

drug resistance [54,55,64]. However since mother D has
not been exposed to antiretroviral drugs (Table 1), this
duplication must have arisen naturally or was present in
the virus that was initially transmitted to mother D. It is
not known at this point, however, what effect this duplication would have on the budding ability of the virus.
Both of the Vpr binding domains were mostly conserved
in the mother-infant sequences obtained, as was the AIP1
binding motif. Again, the conservation of these functional
domains during vertical transmission suggests that it is
important to the virus evolutionarily to maintain the
functions that these regions provide.
Several substitutions were seen outside of the functional
domains mentioned. While the relevance of these changes
is not known at this time, the effects could be studied by
performing biological studies using the NC clones
obtained within this study. Another study of interest
would be to characterize the same NC region in mothers
who naturally failed to transmit the virus to their offspring
and compare the results to that of this study.
There were several CTL epitopes, which were recognized
by several different HLA types, within the mother-infant
NC sequences obtained. It has been shown that transmitting mothers have larger numbers of CTL escape variants
as compared to non-transmitting mothers, but the transmitted viruses carrying epitopes are not escape variants
[57]. It is entirely possible however, that the CTL
responses studied are tissue specific. A representation of
peripheral blood, and the virus and CTL variants in the
placenta, birth canal, and breast milk are different [65].
There were substitutions within the CTL epitopes of the
NC sequences from the six mother-infant pairs; however
it is unknown what effect these changes may have. It is
possible that the substitutions observed in this study may
influence vertical transmission by resulting in differential
responses in a tissue specific manner.
Although great strides have been made in the prevention
of HIV-1 vertical transmission in countries such as the
United States, the infection of children vertically in developing countries remains a large problem. In order deal
with this problem, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved needs to be established. A characterization
of many of the viral genes during vertical transmission has
already been completed [1,2,11,12,14-16,51,59,60], and
has shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of an
HIV-1 vertically acquired infection. Using this previous
information, new targets and strategies may be able to be
developed in order to prevent the spread of this disease.
The data presented in this study may be able to provide
new insights into the molecular characteristics of HIV-1
vertical transmission and further our understanding so

that novel treatment and prevention strategies may be
developed.

Materials and methods

point dilution was subjected to multiple (four to six)
PCRs to obtain clones that were sequenced and analyzed.
PCR was carried out in a 25µl reaction mixture containing
2.5 µl 10× Pfx Amplification buffer, 2.5 mM MgSO4, 400
µM of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.2 µM of each
outer primer, and 2.5 units (U) of Platinum Pfx DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen Inc.). The reaction was initiated at
94°C for 2 minutes (min), and then cycled at 94°C for 30
seconds (sec), 50°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 2 min, for 35
cycles, with an addition extension period of 10 min at
72°C to end the reaction. Following the first round of
PCR, 5–8 µl of the first-PCR product was used for nested
PCR using the same reagents and the inner primers. This
nested PCR was cycled at 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec,
and 72°C for 2 min, for 35 cycles. A negative control was
included with each PCR which used sterile water in place
of DNA. PCR was also performed on HIV-1 NL4-3, of
which the sequence is known (GenBank accession
number M19921), to assess any errors made by the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase. To avoid contamination, all
samples, reagents and PCR products were kept separately
and dispensed in a separate room free of all laboratoryused DNA.

Patient population
Blood samples were collected from six mother-infant
pairs following vertical transmission, including a set of
twins (I1H and I2H) in the case of mother H. The demographics, clinical and laboratory findings on these
mother-infant pairs is summarized in Table 1. The
Human Subjects Committee of the University of Arizona
(Tucson, AZ) and the Institutional Review Board of the
Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, Ohio)
approved this study. Written informed consent to participate in this study was obtained from the mothers of the
mother-infant pairs.

The PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel and
cloned into the TOPO TA cloning system (pCR 2.1-TOPO
vector) as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen
Inc.). Positive bacterial colonies were determined by bluewhite screening, and the presence of correct-sized inserts
was confirmed by restriction digest. Eight to eighteen
clones from each mother and infant, from multiple independent PCRs, were sequenced using the Thermosequenase Cycle Sequencing protocol (USB) and the University
of Arizona Biotechnology Center automated system (ABI
Prism® 3700 DNA automated sequencing system).

PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using a single-step Ficoll-Hypaque method (Pharmacia-LKB) from whole blood samples of HIV-1 infected
mother-and-infant pairs that were involved in vertical
transmission. The PBMCs DNA, which contains the integrated HIV-1 genome, was isolated as previously
described [9]. The HIV-1 NC gene was amplified using a
two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method
according to the modified protocol described by Ahmad
et al [9]. Outer primers NC-1 (5'GAAGAAATGATGACAGCATGTCAGGGAGTGGG, 1819 to 1851, sense) and NC-2
(5'CCATCTTCCTGGCAAATTCATTTCTTCTAATACT,
2344 to 2378, antisense) were first used, followed by
nested primers NC-3 (5'CACCGGCCATAAAGCAAGAGTTTTGGCTGAAGC, 1854 to 1887, sense) and NC-4
(5' CATCTGCTCCTGTATCTAATAGAGCTTCCTT, 2310 to
2341, antisense). Equal amounts of PBMC DNA (approximately 25 to 50 copies, minimum) as determined by end-

Sequence analysis
The nucleotide sequences of the HIV-1 NC gene (approximately 375 bp) from six mother-infant pairs were analyzed using the Wisconsin package version 10.1 of the
Genetics Computer Group (GCG) and were translated to
corresponding deduced amino acid sequences (125
amino acids). Both the nucleotide and amino acid
sequences were aligned, using the HIV-1 NL4-3 NC
sequence as a reference, by Clustal X. A model of evolution was optimized for the entire nucleotide sequence
data set using the Huelsenbeck and Crandall approach
[66]. Likelihood models of evolution were calculated
using PAUP [46] and a chi square (χ2) test was performed
using Modeltest 3.06 [47]. The model with the highest
likelihood was incorporated into PAUP to generate a
neighbor-joining tree, which was bootstrapped 1000
times to ensure fidelity. The tree was based on the nucleotide sequences from the six mother-infant pairs, as well
as HIV-1 NL4-3 which was used as a reference sequence

Conclusion
In this study we have shown that the HIV-1 NC and p6
genes were mostly conserved in six mother-infant pairs
following vertical transmission. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that virus from epidemiologically linked motherinfant pairs was closer to each other than to epidemiologically unlinked pairs. The NC and p6 open reading frames
were highly conserved and estimates of viral heterogeneity
and genetic diversity were low. Several patient and pair
specific substitutions were seen within the NC amino acid
sequence. The functional domains within the NC and p6
sequences, which include two zinc fingers, several basic
residues, a viral late domain, two possible Vpr binding
sites, and a binding site for AIP1, were widely conserved
following vertical transmission. The data presented in this
study provides evidence that supports the critical role of
the NC gene product in the viral lifecycle and in pathogenesis of HIV-1 during vertical transmission.

and the outgroup for the tree. Using Modeltest and the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [67], all the null
hypotheses were rejected except the best-fit model
(GTR+G). The base frequencies for the NC gene were calculated as: freq A = 0.37, freq C = 0.23, freq G = 0.21 and
freq T = 0.19. Five rate categories were also figured, and
were as follows: R(A- C)= 1.00, R (A-G)= 5.34, R(A-T) =
0.79, R(C-G) = 0.79, R(C-T) = 5.34, R(G-T) = 1.00. The
rate heterogeneity was taken into account using a gamma
distribution with a shape parameter (α) of the distribution estimated from the data via maximum likelihood.
This shape parameter had a value of 0.7085. A model of
evolution for each patient was also generated and optimized to estimate corrected pairwise nucleotide distances
using PAUP [46]. Amino acid distances were also estimated using the Jukes-Cantor model within the Wisconsin package version 10.1 of GCG. The minimum, median,
and maximum distance values were calculated for both
nucleotides and amino acids for each patient as well as for
the linked and unlinked patient pairs. The dynamics of
HIV-1 evolution was assessed using techniques of population genetics. In population genetics, genetic diversity is
defined as θ = 2Neµ, where Ne is the effective population
size and µ is the per nucleotide mutation rate per generation. The Watterson model, which assumes segregated
sites, and the Metropolis-Hastings model, which assumes
a constant population size, was used to estimate the differences in genetic diversity using the Coalesce 1.5 program [68,69]. To analyze the evolutionary processes
acting upon the NC gene, we estimated the ratio of nonsynonymous (dn) to synonymous (ds) substitutions by a
maximum likelihood model using codeML, which is part
of the PAML package [49]. The Nielsen and Yang [48]
model considers the codon instead of the nucleotide as
the unit of evolution and thus incorporates three distinct
categories of sites. The first category represents the sites
that are invariable or conserved (p1, dn/ds = 0); the second category represents sites that are neutral (p2, dn/ds =
l), at which dn and ds are fixed at the same rate; and the
third category represents sites that are under positive
selection, where dn has a higher fixation rate than ds (p3,
dn/ds >1). The dn/ds was estimated for each patient using
both neutral and positive selection models in codeML.
