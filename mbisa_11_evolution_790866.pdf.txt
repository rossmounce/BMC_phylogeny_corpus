Abstract
Background: The Q151M multi-drug resistance (MDR) pathway in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) confers reduced
susceptibility to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) excluding tenofovir (TDF). This pathway emerges
after long term failure of therapy, and is increasingly observed in the resource poor world, where antiretroviral therapy
is rarely accompanied by intensive virological monitoring. In this study we examined the genotypic, phenotypic and
fitness correlates associated with the development of Q151M MDR in the absence of viral load monitoring.
Results: Single-genome sequencing (SGS) of full-length RT was carried out on sequential samples from an HIVinfected individual enrolled in ART rollout. The emergence of Q151M MDR occurred in the order A62V, V75I, and
finally Q151M on the same genome at 4, 17 and 37 months after initiation of therapy, respectively. This was
accompanied by a parallel cumulative acquisition of mutations at 20 other codon positions; seven of which were
located in the connection subdomain. We established that fourteen of these mutations are also observed in
Q151M-containing sequences submitted to the Stanford University HIV database. Phenotypic drug susceptibility
testing demonstrated that the Q151M-containing RT had reduced susceptibility to all NRTIs except for TDF. RT
domain-swapping of patient and wild-type RTs showed that patient-derived connection subdomains were not
associated with reduced NRTI susceptibility. However, the virus expressing patient-derived Q151M RT at 37 months
demonstrated ~44% replicative capacity of that at 4 months. This was further reduced to ~22% when the Q151Mcontaining DNA pol domain was expressed with wild-type C-terminal domain, but was then fully compensated by
coexpression of the coevolved connection subdomain.
Conclusions: We demonstrate a complex interplay between drug susceptibility and replicative fitness in the
acquisition Q151M MDR with serious implications for second-line regimen options. The acquisition of the Q151M
pathway occurred sequentially over a long period of failing NRTI therapy, and was associated with mutations in
multiple RT domains.

Background
RT inhibitors (RTIs) are the mainstay of combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART). Recommended first-line
therapy regimens for HIV-1 treatment usually comprise
two nucleos(t)ide RTIs (NRTIs) plus a third agent,
either a non-nucleoside RTI (NNRTI) or a boosted

protease inhibitor (bPI) or integrase inhibitor [1-3].
More than 90 mutations have been identified in HIV-1
RT to be associated with resistance to RTIs, and the
majority are clustered either around the polymerase
active site or the hydrophobic binding pocket of
NNRTIs in the DNA pol domain of RT [4-7]. A consequence of some of these mutations is a severe loss of
viral replicative capacity which can subsequently be
restored by compensatory mutations elsewhere within
RT [8].

The Q151M MDR is important because it has been
shown to confer resistance to almost all NRTIs with the
exception of TDF [9]. The Q151M MDR complex is
composed of the Q151M mutation, which is normally
the first to appear, followed by at least two of the following four mutations: A62V, V75I, F77L and F116Y
[10]. The Q151M MDR complex was initially described
to develop during long-term NRTI-containing combination therapy or NRTI therapy with zidovudine (AZT)
and/or didanosine (ddI) [11,12]; however, it is now
rarely observed in resource-rich countries, where more
potent cART is used. It is believed that the Q151M
MDR complex occurs infrequently because the Q151 to
M mutation requires a 2-bp change (CAG to ATG), and
the two possible intermediate changes of Q151L (CAG
to CTG) and Q151K (CAG to AAG) significantly reduce
viral replication capacity in vitro and are seldom
observed in vivo [13-15]. The replicative capacity of a
Q151L-containing virus was shown to improve in the
presence of S68G and M230I mutations suggesting that
compensatory mutations could favour the emergence of
the Q151M MDR complex [13,15].
The Q151M complex has been identified in up to
19% of patients failing therapy containing stavudine
(d4T) as part of ART rollout in the developing world,
particularly where treatment is given without virological monitoring, thus allowing long term viraemia
whilst on first-line therapy [16-18]. This includes the
CHAP2 (Children with HIV Antibiotic Prophylaxis)
prospective cohort study of Zambian children on a
first-line therapy of lamivudine (3TC)/d4T/nevirapine
(NVP) where 2 out of 26 children (8%) for whom resistance data were obtained had developed resistance via
this pathway [19].
Although mutations causing resistance to RTIs have
been shown to occur mainly in the DNA pol domain of
RT, recent studies have implicated mutations in the Cterminal region of RT in resistance and possibly in
restoring replication fitness of the HIV-1 drug-resistant
variants [20,21]. Some of these mutations, such as
N348I in the connection subdomain, have been reported
to have a prevalence of 10-20% in treatment-experienced individuals [22]. The N348I mutation is associated
with M184V and TAMs, and increases resistance to
NRTIs such as AZT, as well as the NNRTI NVP. N348I
confers resistance by reducing RNase H activity which
allows more time for the excision or dissociation of the
RT inhibitors [22-27]. However, few data are available
on the evolution and genetic linkage of C-terminal
mutations in the context of Q151M MDR complex,
especially in non-B subtypes. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of sequential samples collected from a patient in the CHAP2 cohort study who

had developed resistance via the Q151M pathway to dissect the intrapatient viral population dynamics in the
context of full-length RT.

Results
We investigated the emergence of the Q151M MDR
complex in one of the two patients in the CHAP2
cohort study who had developed resistance via the
Q151M pathway [19]. The patient, designated P66, was
infected with HIV-1 subtype C virus.
Dynamics of emergence and genetic linkage of Q151M
MDR complex mutations

Patients enrolled in the CHAP2 cohort study had CD4
counts done approximately every 6 months and plasma
was stored for retrospective viral load and genotypic
testing. For patient P66, six samples were collected at 0,
4, 10, 17, 28, and 37 months after initiation of therapy;
four of which were available for viral load testing and
SGS analysis. The viral load and CD4% counts for
patient P66 are shown in figure 1. We initially determined the development of Q151M MDR complex using
SGS of full-length RT gene in the four sequential samples collected from patient P66 at 4, 17, 28 and 37
months. More than 30 single-genome sequences were
generated per time point except for the 4- and 28month time points when we obtained 6 and 0 sequences
respectively. Genetic linkage analysis of the single genomes at 4, 17 and 37 months showed that the patient
acquired the Q151M MDR mutations in the order:
A62V, V75I and finally Q151M (Table 1). The emergence of Q151M after the secondary mutations A62V
and V75I is rare. In addition, the analysis showed that
drug resistance mutation T69N was genetically linked to
Q151M MDR mutations and was acquired prior to
Q151M.
Accessory mutations in the DNA pol domain of RT
have previously been demonstrated in the route to
acquisition of Q151M MDR complex in subtype B
viruses [12,28]. We, therefore, determined whether
accessory mutations developed in this subtype C HIV-1
virus and whether the C-terminal region of RT played a
role in the emergence of the Q151M MDR complex.
The emergence and presence of mutations in DNA pol
domain, connection subdomain and RNase H domain
were assessed by SGS, and their genetic linkage to
Q151M MDR mutations was determined. A pre-treatment sample was not available for analysis from patient
P66; therefore a codon change was scored as a mutation
if it met one of the following criteria: (i) if it was a
known drug resistance mutation as determined by International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) [29], (ii) if it was
not present in sequences from a previous time point or

underwent a significant change in frequency between
time points. This analysis showed a cumulative increase
in mutations in all RT domains (Table 1). Mutations
were identified at 12 codon positions in DNA pol
domain, namely, 31, 33, 48, 68, 102, 123, 135, 174, 197,
202, 203 and 314; seven in connection subdomain, 357,
371, 386, 399, 403, 458 and 471; and one in RNase H
domain, 517. The correlation between the progressive
increments in the frequency of these mutations and the
sequential acquisition of the Q151M MDR mutations
suggested that they could be facilitating the emergence
of the Q151M MDR complex. This notion is further
supported by the observation that 18 out of the 20
mutations were present in a majority of the single genomes by 37 months and nearly half of them were present in all the single genomes (Table 1).
The Q151M MDR mutations were also genetically
linked to NRTI mutations M184IV and L210F, and
NNRTI mutations E138A, Y181I and H221Y (Table 1).
Of note, the N348I mutation was identified in the connection subdomain of all single genomes at 4 months.
However, the mutation was present in only one out of
33 single genomes at 17 months but none of the 31 single genomes at 37 months when the Q151M mutation
emerged (Table 1).
Intrapatient viral genetic diversity in the route to
acquisition of Q151M MDR complex

The evolution and viral population dynamics within
patient P66 were examined further by phylogenetic

analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees of the PR-RT
single-genome sequences generated from the sequential
samples of the patient are shown in Figure 2A. In general, the ML-inferred genealogy clustered all single genomes from each time point within a monophyletic clade
with corresponding progressive increases in genetic distances. Intriguingly, the analyses also showed a serial
replacement effect with sequences from successive time
points arising from a single branch of a cluster of
sequences from a preceding time point. This suggests a
serial founder effect in the development of Q151M
MDR. Furthermore, ML-inferred genealogy of the
sequences with drug resistance codons removed showed
that the serial founder effect and monophyletic clustering of the sequences from each time point was maintained (Figure 2B). This indicates that the identified
accessory mutations could be playing an important role
in the evolution and development of the Q151M MDR.
High prevalence of some of the identified accessory
mutations in subtype B and C infected patients

Next, we determined if the 20 accessory mutations that
we identified in patient P66 were present in other
patients who had developed resistance via the Q151M
pathway. We compared mutation frequencies in subtype
B or C samples from RTI-treatment naÃ¯ve patients and
Q151M-containing patient samples on the Stanford University HIV drug resistance database. A significant number of sequences (15 to 12,361) were available for
analysis in each subgroup, except for connection subdomain and RNase H domain of Q151M-containing subtype C sequences, in which there was only one sample
sequenced beyond the DNA pol domain. Therefore, the
analysis for subtype C sequences could only be carried
out for the DNA pol domain. This showed that eight out
of the 12 codon positions identified in the DNA pol
domain of patient P66 were significantly associated with
the sequences containing the Q151M mutation compared to RTI-treatment naÃ¯ve sequences. These codon
positions were 31, 33, 48, 68, 123, 174, 202 and 203 (P â¤
0.042; Table 2). In contrast, two of these codon positions,
namely 48 and 174, were not associated with the acquisition of Q151M in subtype B infected patients, but an
additional two others were, namely 102 and 197 (P â¤
0.029). Interestingly, codon positions 386 and 403 in connection subdomain were also significantly associated with
the acquisition of Q151M in subtype B infected individuals (P â¤ 0.018). These data indicate that some of the
accessory mutations identified in the DNA pol domain
and connection subdomain of patient P66 are highly prevalent in patients who develop resistance through the
Q151M pathway and that they could be playing an
important role in the acquisition of the Q151M MDR.

C-terminal mutations are not associated with decreased
susceptibility of Q151M-containing viruses to NRTIs in
patient P66

Consequently, we investigated whether the C-terminal
mutations we observed affected susceptibility to NRTIs.
Unique restriction sites were introduced in RT and IN
genes without changing the amino acid coding, in both
the packaging vector and cloned patient fragments in
order to facilitate RT domain-swapping (Figure 3A).
The patient-derived RTs remained d4T-susceptible until

the development of the Q151M mutation at 37 months,
when there was a significant increase (~16-fold) in IC50
values compared to wild-type RT (Figure 3B; P < 0.002).
At most we observed a 1.3-fold change in susceptibility
to d4T at 4 or 17 months leading us to conclude that
Q151M is the main contributor to d4T resistance in the
Q151M MDR complex. The patient-derived RT exhibited a 23-fold increase in 3TC IC50 values at 4 months
which did not increase at 17 and 37 months despite the
acquisition of the Q151M MDR mutations (Table 3).

(A) Phylogenetic tree of 70 single genomes generated from 3 sequential samples from patient P66 infected with subtype C HIV-1 virus. (B) Same
as (A) but with the following 12 RT drug resistance codons removed from the aligned single-genome sequences to determine the effect of drug
resistance mutations on viral evolution: 62, 69, 75, 90, 138, 151, 181, 184, 210, 221, 230 and 348. The trees were rooted using the subtype C
reference sequence MJ4.

The effect on susceptibility to 3TC was probably due to
M184I/V mutations which were seen by 4 months. The
23-fold reduction in susceptibility is relatively lower
than observed in other studies [30,31]. This could be
because our assay uses full-length RT fragments derived
from clinical isolates. It has recently been shown that
the use of a co-evolved or subtype-specific C-terminal
region of RT can influence the magnitude of drug resistance observed in a phenotypic drug susceptibility assay
[32].
Analysis of susceptibilities of patient-derived RTs to
the CHAP2 second-line NRTIs ddI and ABC showed a
cumulative decrease in susceptibility in the order; 1.2and 1.7-fold at 4 months, 4- and 6-fold at 17 months,
and finally 9.9- and 10.8-fold at 37 months, respectively
(Figure 3C). Thus, unlike d4T the cumulative acquisition
of mutations on the route to Q151M MDR complex
results in a parallel cumulative decrease in susceptibilities to ABC and ddI. In addition, the recombinant
viruses expressing patient-derived RTs exhibited
decreased susceptibilities to NRTIs FTC of >79-fold at 4
months and AZT of >15-fold at 37 months (Table 3)
but remained susceptible to TDF even after the acquisition of the Q151M mutation at 37 months (Figure 3D)
with no significant increases in IC50 values (P > 0.18).
The susceptibility to TDF could probably be influenced
by the presence of M184V which has been shown to
increase HIV-1 sensitivity to TDF [33,34].
The expression of the patient-derived DNA pol
domain at 37 months plus wild-type C-terminal region

or coevolved connection subdomain showed no significant differences in IC50 values to d4T (P > 0.05) suggesting that none of the identified C-terminal mutations
in patient P66 at 37 months contributed to the reduction in susceptibility to d4T (Figure 3B). Similarly, the
coevolved C-terminal region did not contribute to 3TC
resistance, including the previously identified N348I
mutation at 4 months, neither did they contribute to the
decreases in susceptibility to ABC, ddI or FTC (Figure
3C and 3D and Table 3). However, we observed an
effect of the C-terminal mutations at 37 months to
AZT, with the co-evolved C-terminal region contributing a 2.5-fold increase in AZT resistance (Table 3).
Finally, we determined the effect of the mutations on
susceptibility to NVP, the NNRTI used for first-line
therapy in the CHAP2 cohort study. The recombinant
viruses expressing the patient-derived C-terminal region
at 4 months, but not at 17 or 37 months, exhibited a 5fold increase in the NVP IC50 value relative to wild-type
(P < 0.002; Table 4). The decrease in NVP susceptibility
associated with the C-terminal domain at 4 months is
likely due to the presence of the N348I mutation in the
connection subdomain which disappears at later time
points.
Connection subdomain mutations in patient P66 partially
restore replicative fitness of Q151M MDR-containing
viruses

Since we did not observe any association of C-terminal
mutations at 37 months with a decrease in susceptibilities

to first-line drugs, we evaluated their effect on virus replicative capacity by infecting HEK293T cells with equivalent amounts of virus. The patientâs sample before
initiation of therapy was not available, thus the replicative
capacity of the viruses measured by relative luciferase
light units was compared to that of the virus expressing
full-length patient-derived RT at 4 months. The patientderived RT at 4 months had already developed the
M184I mutation which is known to affect viral replicative
fitness [35,36]. The virus expressing the full-length
patient-derived RT containing the Q151M mutation at

37 months demonstrated ~42% replicative capacity of
full-length patient-derived RT at 4 months (P < 0.0001;
Figure 2E). This was further significantly decreased to
~22% (P < 0.0001) when the patient-derived DNA pol
domain at 37 months was expressed in combination with
wild-type connection subdomain and RNase H domain.
This decrease in replicative capacity was fully compensated (to ~55% replicative capacity) by the coexpression
of the coevolved connection subdomain at 37 months. In
contrast, replicative capacity of the full-length patientderived RT at 17 months was comparable to that at 4

months. This suggests that the Q151M mutation, as well
as being the main determinant of drug resistance in the
Q151M MDR complex, also has a more significant effect
on virus replication fitness that is partially restored by
mutations in the connection subdomain.

Discussion
Multiple mutations throughout HIV-1 RT are associated
with RTI resistance including recently identified mutations in the connection subdomain and RNase H
domain [10,21,27]. However, there are few data on

sequential acquisition and genetic linkage of these mutations and their impact on drug susceptibility and replicative capacity, especially in non-B subtype HIV-1
viruses which account for nearly 90% of the epidemic
worldwide [37]. In this study, we took advantage of
treatment failure in the absence of viral load-guided
therapy to dissect the relative contribution of RT
domains in the route to high-level NRTI drug resistance
through the Q151M pathway.
As expected we found that the development of mutations was broad throughout RT. The virus from the
patient we investigated had developed more than 12
known drug resistance mutations and 20 additional
mutations in RT, nearly half of which were located in
the connection subdomain. A refined analysis of the
emergence and development of these mutations in
sequential samples by SGS revealed a chronological
increase in frequency that paralleled the sequential
acquisition of Q151M MDR mutations. In addition, the

analysis showed genetic linkage of most of these mutations to Q151M MDR mutations indicating an association between the two. Although our results are from
one patient, the identified mutations in the pol domain
at codon positions 68 and 202 were previously identified
in patients infected with subtype B HIV-1 viruses
[12,28] and in an HIV database sequence analysis done
in this study (Table 2). The database sequence analysis
also showed that the DNA pol domain mutations at
codon positions 31, 33, 48, 102, 123, 135, 174, 197 and
203 were significantly associated with Q151M in subtype
B and/or C.
We show that although the connection subdomain
mutations were acquired in parallel with Q151M MDR
mutations they were not directly associated with drug
resistance but played a role in improving the replicative
fitness of the Q151M-containing viruses. Our findings
confirm previous reports showing that the Q151M-containing virus replicates poorly [13,14,38,39]. We clearly
show that the patient-derived connection subdomain is
important for improving the Q151M-containing virusâ
replicative fitness and is thus important for the development of the Q151M pathway. It will be interesting to
elucidate the particular mutations involved and the
mechanism behind the connection subdomainâs effect
on replicative fitness of the Q151M-containing RT. The
mutation at connection subdomain codon positions 386
and 403 were significantly associated with Q151M in
the subtype B database analysis; however, a similar analysis could not be carried out for subtype C due to lack
of samples sequenced beyond the DNA pol domain.
Since the connection subdomain is involved in positioning of the template-primer complex at the polymerase
active site, one possibility could be that the mutations
improve enzyme-substrate interactions at the active site.
Of note, the intermediate Q151K or L mutations which
have been postulated to be involved in the emergence of
the Q151M mutation were never identified in our SGS
analysis. It is possible that these mutations do emerge
but are only present transiently due to their negative
effect on replication and, as a result, were missed in this
analysis. This possibility could not be explored further
in this study as we were unable to amplify any genomes
at 28 months, the time point prior to the emergence of
the Q151M mutation.
It was surprising to observe that the patient-derived
connection subdomain and RNase H domain were not
associated with the decreased susceptibility to NRTIs
exhibited by the Q151M MDR-containing RTs and also
that the N348I mutation disappeared prior to the acquisition of Q151M. As described earlier, N348I confers
drug resistance by decreasing RNase H activity, thus it
will be interesting to explore if a negative correlation
exists between reduced RNase H activity and Q151M.

Mbisa et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:31
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/31

Another surprising finding was that full-blown resistance did not develop until 37 months after initiation of
therapy, even though the viral load had been relatively
high at earlier time points. This raises the possibility of
suboptimal use of the drugs contributing to the emergence of the Q151M MDR complex.

Conclusions
Understanding the evolution and molecular mechanisms
leading to the emergence of the Q151M MDR complex
is important especially in light of its relatively frequent
occurrence in some ARV rollout cohorts. As shown in
this study and other previous reports [9], the presence
of the Q151M mutation significantly limits the options
for second-line therapies as the Q151M-containing virus
remains only susceptible to one approved NRTI, TDF.
Our results showed that the Q151M MDR takes a long
time to develop and keeping patients on failing NRTI
therapy could be facilitating its emergence. The Q151M
MDR is also often linked to other NRTI and NNRTI
mutations which develop earlier and thus further limiting the options for second-line regimens. In addition,
the virus acquires compensatory mutations throughout
RT which make it fitter, resulting in a virus that could
persist even after switching to second-line therapy. This
is a major obstacle in the developing world where fixed
second-line therapies are composed of two alternate
NRTIs (usually not TDF) and bPI. Thus, these types of
studies are important in guiding public health
approaches to the treatment and clinical management of
HIV-1 infections in resource-poor settings.
Methods
Clinical HIV samples and database analysis

The plasma samples characterized in this study were
from a patient enrolled in the CHAP2 prospective
cohort study at the University Teaching Hospital in
Lusaka, Zambia [19]. Children in this study were
initiated on first-line cART of 3TC/d4T/NVP (adult
Triomune30) and, following immunological or clinical
failure, were switched to a fixed second-line therapy of
Abacavir (ABC)/ddI/Kaletra. The prevalence of identified accessory mutations in clinical samples was analyzed using the Stanford University HIV drug resistance
database (http://hivdb.Stanford.edu).
SGS assay

A previously described SGS assay [40] was modified by
designing new antisense primers in integrase (IN) and
used to sequence the full-length protease (PR) and RT
genes from sequential samples. Briefly, viral RNA was
extracted from 200 Î¼L of plasma using QIAmp UltraSens Virus Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturerâs
instructions and eluted in 60 Î¼L of elution buffer.

Page 9 of 11

cDNA synthesis and single genome PCR reactions were
carried out as described previously [40] using primers
1849+ (5â-GATGACAGCATGTCAGGGAG-3â) and
4368- (5â-GCTAGCTACTATTTCTTTTGCTACT-3â),
followed by a nested PCR with primers 1870+ (5âGAGTTTTGGCTGAGGCAATGAG-3â) and 4295- (5âCTTTCATGCTCTTCTTGAGCCT-3â). Positive PCR
products were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis
and purified using illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band
Purification Kit (GE Healthcare), and sequenced by the
dideoxy ABI sequencing systems in both directions
using overlapping internal primers. Sequences were analyzed using Sequencher software (Gene Codes) and
aligned by using subtype-specific consensus sequences.
Any sequences containing double peaks in the chromatographs were excluded. Drug resistance mutations were
defined by using the Stanford University HIV drug resistance database.
Phylogenetic analyses

Full-length PR-RT nucleotide single-genome sequences
from patient P66 and subtype-specific reference
sequence MJ4 (subtype C) were aligned using Clustal W
in MEGA4 software [41]. The aligned sequences were
imported into PhyML tree building software and ML
trees were constructed using the GTR model and the
robustness of the trees was evaluated by bootstrap analysis with 500 rounds of replication.
Single-replication cycle drug susceptibility assay

A recently described three plasmid-based retroviral vector system using a luciferase reporter gene was used to
study phenotypic drug susceptibility [42,43]. Briefly, vector p8MJ4 was modified to accommodate RT domainswapping by introducing three restriction enzyme sites,
HpaI (flanking RT amino acids 288/289), SpeI (flanking
RT amino acids 423/424) and ClaI (flanking IN amino
acids 4/5) creating p8MJ4-HSC. The MJ4 sequence also
contains a natural and unique ApaI site in p6 region of
gag. In addition, the SpeI site in gag and two ClaI sites
(upstream of gag initiation codon and in gag) were
eliminated to ensure that the introduced sites were
unique. In parallel, patient-derived PR-RT single genomes that closely represented the sequence of the
majority of the single genomes at each time point were
subcloned into a TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) by PCR
using primers GagApaF (5â-GCAGGGCCCCTAGGAAAAAGGGC-3â) and CRhINClaIR1 (5â-CCTTATCGATTCCATCTAGAAATAGC-3â). Similarly, HpaI
(flanking RT amino acids 288/289) and SpeI (flanking
RT amino acids 423/424) sites were introduced and any
HpaI or SpeI sites that were present in the cloned
patient fragments were removed using sequence-specific
primers. Mutagenesis reactions were carried out by site-

directed mutagenesis using QuikChange Lightning Multi
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies)
and the presence and absence of each mutation was verified by sequencing. The other two vectors used in the
system are pMDG encoding the vesicular stomatitis
virus G protein and retroviral expression vector
pCSFLW which encodes for the luciferase reporter gene.
Virus stocks were prepared by cotransfection of
HEK293T cells as described previously [44-46], diluted
50- to 500-fold and used to infect HEK293T target cells.
The virus and target cells were incubated with medium
containing varying drug concentrations for 48 h. Infectivity was determined by measuring luciferase activity in
the target cells using Steady-Glo reporter assay system
(Promega). Data were expressed relative to that of no
drug controls and the drug concentrations required to
inhibit virus replication by 50% (IC50) were determined
by linear regression analysis. Results are expressed as
fold changes in the IC50 compared to wild-type subtype
C virus.
Antiretroviral drugs

The NRTIs ABC, AZT, ddI, emtricitabine (FTC), 3TC
and d4T; and the NNRTIs efavirenz (EFV), etravirine
(ETV), and NVP were obtained from the NIH AIDS
Research and Reference Reagent Program. TDF was a
generous gift from Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA,
USA).
Replicative capacity Assay

Recombinant viruses expressing wild-type and patientderived RT domains were normalized for p24 capsid
(Genetic Systems HIV-1 Ag EIA; Bio-Rad) and used to
infect target HEK293T cells in a single-cycle-replication
assay. Replicative capacity was determined by measuring
luciferase activity as described above.
Statistical analyses

Studentâs t test was used to describe differences in IC50
values and replicative capacity and two proportions analysis was performed by using Fisherâs Exact test with P
values < 0.05 regarded as significant for both tests (StataSE software).
