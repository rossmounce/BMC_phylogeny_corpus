Abstract
Background: Intron gains reportedly are very rare during evolution of vertebrates, and the
mechanisms underlying their creation are largely unknown. Previous investigations have shown
that, during metazoan radiation, the exon-intron patterns of serpin superfamily genes were subject
to massive changes, in contrast to many other genes.
Results: Here we investigated intron dynamics in the serpin superfamily in lineages pre- and
postdating the split of vertebrates. Multiple intron gains were detected in a group of ray-finned
fishes, once the canonical groups of vertebrate serpins had been established. In two genes, cooccurrence of non-standard introns was observed, implying that intron gains in vertebrates may
even happen concomitantly or in a rapidly consecutive manner. DNA breakage/repair processes
associated with genome compaction are introduced as a novel factor potentially favoring intron
gain, since all non-canonical introns were found in a lineage of ray-finned fishes that experienced
genomic downsizing.
Conclusion: Multiple intron acquisitions were identified in serpin genes of a lineage of ray-finned
fishes, but not in any other vertebrates, suggesting that insertion rates for introns may be
episodically increased. The co-occurrence of non-standard introns within the same gene discloses
the possibility that introns may be gained simultaneously. The sequences flanking the intron
insertion points correspond to the proto-splice site consensus sequence MAG↑N, previously
proposed to serve as intron insertion site. The association of intron gains in the serpin superfamily
with a group of fishes that underwent genome compaction may indicate that DNA breakage/repair
processes might foster intron birth.

Background
Spliceosomal introns are key attributes of most eukaryotic
genes. Their origin is still unclear, though descent from
group II self-splicing introns seems to be likely [1,2]. All
components essential for removal of intronic sequences, a
prerequisite for maturation of most transcripts and formation of functional gene products, have been identified in
basal eukaryotes [3], indicating that the ability to cope
with spliceosomal introns was fully developed in the last
common ancestor of eukaryotes. In addition to their
obscure provenance, spliceosomal introns present
another unresolved enigma. In many taxa, intron dynamics is dominated by losses, and gains of introns were often
found to be rare [reviewed in ref. [2]]. In recent mass analyses of various vertebrate genomes, no intron gains were
detected [4,5]. With some genes and lineages, however,
intron acquisition can hardly be questioned [6-8]. Several
proposals have been brought forward to explain intron
birth [2,9-11], but how these sequences were actually created, is still mysterious.
The serpins are a superfamily of proteins that cover a
highly divergent spectrum of functions [12,13]. The origin
of these proteins, primarily encompassing inhibitors of
serine proteases, but also including members with entirely
other tasks, is not known. Serpins are found in all major
branches of the tree of life, but they are rare in fungi, and
their distribution in archaea and eubacteria is disjunct. In
vertebrates, serpins participate in the control of blood
coagulation, fibrinolysis, and other proteolytic pathways
[12]. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, serpins are
also engaged in regulating the innate immune response.
An arms race between proteases of pathogens and host
protease inhibitors, and vice versa, was proposed to foster
functional diversification of serpins [14,15].
In vertebrates, serpin genes are often arranged in tandem
arrays and they constitute a substantial fraction of mammalian genomes. During diversification of vertebrates the
superfamily has undergone considerable expansion
[16,17]. Serpins are unusual compared to most other
superfamilies with regards to the dynamics of gene organization. Genes from basal metazoans, such as annelids
[18] or sea anemones [19], often share an intron-rich
structure with their vertebrate homologues, implying that
introns may be stably maintained for hundreds of millions of years. Serpin genes of basal metazoans, in contrast, are not generally intron-rich, and their exon-intron
structures are not conserved along the lineages leading to
vertebrates. Sporadic investigations of various species
revealed radically different intron patterns in serpin genes,
indicating that, during diversification of eumetazoans,
massive changes in gene architectures have occurred
[20,21]. The structures of serpin genes from various vertebrates (Figure 1), however, proved to be strongly con-

served, enabling reliable, intron-coded classification of
the superfamily into six groups (V1–V6). Generally, there
is very little congruence between these groups concerning
numbers and positions of introns. Altogether, 25 different
intron positions mapping to the serpin scaffold were
detected, but none of them is common to the entire superfamily [22].
Here, we investigated the structures of serpin genes from
lineages that pre- and postdate the split of vertebrates in
order to get insight into the dynamics of their introns. The
data disclose that, after establishment of major groups of
vertebrate serpin genes, multiple non-canonical introns
emerged in a lineage of ray-finned fishes.

Results
Appearance of exon-intron patterns characteristic for
vertebrate serpins
We first studied serpin genes and their cDNAs in two lancelet species, Branchiostoma lanceolatum (B. lanceolatum) and
Branchiostoma floridae (B. floridae), representing a group of
extant cephalochordates (phylum: Chordata). Experimental approaches disclosed several genes and cDNAs coding
for serpins in B. lanceolatum, further superfamily members
were detected by mining the genome of the closely related
B. floridae [23]. Altogether, three types of serpin genes (L1–
L3) with distinctly different intron patterns were observed
(Figure 1; Additional file 1). Following the previous convention [22], intron positions are projected onto the
sequence of the human serpin α1-antitrypsin. The phases
of introns are indicated by the suffixes a-c, according to
their location after the first, second, or third base of the
codon in question. In this reference system, the two
introns of L1 genes map to positions 75c and ~176a (the
exact position of this intron is ambiguous, due to alignment problems). The L2 genes contain introns at positions ~86b, 151c, 223b, 283c and 339c. The L3 genes
exhibit common introns at positions 73b, 125b, ~175c
and 339c, however, there are also introns that are unique
to individual group members (position 280b in
Bflor_Spn9; positions 224b and 278b in Bflor_Spn10).
Another intron in Bflor_Spn10 is located outside the conserved serpin scaffold (gene-specific numbering of position: 29a). There are several additional serpin-like
sequences in the B. floridae genome, but it is currently not
discernible whether they represent intact genes (not
shown); however, it is clear that serpin genes from lancelets and vertebrates differ largely with respect to their
exon-intron organizations. In fact, just a single intron
location (position 339c) is shared. Apparently, major
changes affecting the exon-intron patterns of serpin genes
have occurred since the cephalochordate/vertebrate split.

Having established lancelets as appropriate outgroup for
evaluating evolution of serpins in vertebrates, we turned to

Figure 1
Intron-coded classification of serpin genes from vertebrates and lancelets and overview on intron gain positions
Intron-coded classification of serpin genes from vertebrates and lancelets and overview on intron gain positions. Vertebrate serpins are classified into six groups (V1–V6), based on group-specific sets of standard introns (black arrowheads). Characteristic representatives of each group are shown on the right. Non-canonical introns (marked in colors also
used to indicate the genes concerned) are exclusively present in a lineage of ray-finned fishes, including Oryzias latipes (Japanese
medaka), Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback), Tetraodon nigroviridis (green-spotted pufferfish) and Takifugu rubripes (Japanese
pufferfish), but not in Petromyzon marinus and Lampetra fluviatilis (lampreys), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and tetrapods. Positions of
introns (indicated on top) refer to human α1-antitrypsin, their phases (a-c) are given with respect to their location after the
first, second or third base of the codon concerned. For comparison, serpins from lancelets (groups L1 to L3, intron positions
indicated by grey arrowheads) have been included, demonstrating that there is little congruence concerning intron positions
within the serpin superfamily. The intron at position 262c in group V5 (white arrowhead) is only found in fishes and was possibly lost in tetrapods. Some genes of group V1 lack the 85c intron. Some introns of L3 genes from B. floridae are restricted to
individual members of this group (intron 280b: Spn9; introns 224b and 278b: Spn10). Due to alignment problems, the exact
positions of the following introns are ambiguous: group V3, intron 86a-90a; group L1, intron 176a; group L2, intron 86b; group
L3, intron 175c. Only introns mapping to the conserved serpin scaffold (amino acids 33 to 394 of human α1-antitrypsin) are
considered.

lampreys, a group of basal, jawless fishes. Lampreys, in
sharp contrast with lancelets, depict at least four of the six
canonical groups of vertebrate serpins. A survey of cDNA
and genomic sequences from Lampetra fluviatilis (L. fluviatilis; European river lamprey) and from Petromyzon marinus (P. marinus; sea lamprey) revealed representatives of
groups V2, V4 and V6 (Additional file 2). We also infer
that intact members of group V1 exist as indicated by the
isolation of a corresponding full-length cDNA from L. fluviatilis. The associated gene contains all introns characteristic for group V1 with the exception of the 78c intron
that, presumably due to its large size, remained undetec-

ted (unpublished results). Members of groups V3 and V5
were not identified.
Inspection of lamprey serpin sequences disclosed the
presence of angiotensinogen and heparin cofactor II
(HCII), two prominent members of group V2. All known
angiotensinogen proteins depict a conserved decapeptide
sequence close to the N-terminus that, after controlled
enzymatic cleavage, gives rise to formation of peptides
(angiotensin I-IV) involved in blood pressure regulation
and other important physiological processes [24]. Clearly,
such a sequence is also present in angiotensinogen ortho-

logues from L. fluviatilis and P. marinus (Figure 2). The
NVIYFKG signature (positions 268–274 in L. fluviatilis),
among other features, definitely reveals this protein as
member of the serpin superfamily.
HCII, a serpin well known from various tetrapods, is a
potent thrombin inhibitor in the presence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Characteristic features of all
HCII sequences are the highly conserved Arg/Lys-rich
helix D that is involved in GAG binding and the acidic Nterminal extension that mediates GAG accelerated
thrombin inhibition [25,26]. These features are also
found in lamprey HCII (Additional file 1). The genes coding for angiotensinogen and HCII from lampreys each
depict introns that interrupt the serpin scaffold at positions 192a, 282b, and 331c (standard repertoire of group
V2; positions of group-specific standard introns are
marked in red in all figures showing alignments). Beyond
that, there are additional introns mapping to the N-termiA1

nus of HCII from P. marinus (see below). We also recognized a lamprey serpin exhibiting the exon-intron pattern
of group V6 (introns at positions 192a, 225a, and 300c;
Figure 3) as HSP47 orthologue. HSP47, a non-inhibitory
serpin, is a specialized ER residing chaperone involved in
folding and transport of procollagens [13,27]. A hallmark
of all HSP47 proteins is the C-terminal ER retention/
retrieval signal (HDEL/KDEL/RDEL). We conclude that
angiotensinogen, HCII, and HSP47 are distinct members
of the serpin superfamily that appeared early during vertebrate evolution. These proteins have persisted since at
least 360 million years, assuming that the morphological
concordance between a fossil lamprey from the Devonian
period [28] and its present-day relatives is reflected on the
molecular level.

Alignment of angiotensinogen sequences and intron location analysis. Angiotensinogen sequences were aligned
together with mature human α1-antitrypsin (A1) serving as reference protein. The following color code is used to characterize
introns: red, standard introns; green, non-canonical introns exclusively present in Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Takifugu rubripes (Fugu), but not in lampreys (Petromyzon marinus, Lampetra fluviatilis), tetrapods (human, chicken) and Danio rerio.
Positions and phases (a-c) of introns are depicted above the alignment and refer to human α1-antitrypsin. The angiotensin signature sequence is reproduced in white on pink background. Residues conserved in all sequences are printed in white on grey

Intron gain in group V6 during diversification of ray-finned fishes
Intron gain in group V6 during diversification of ray-finned fishes. Ray-finned fishes contain up to three HSP47-related
genes basically sharing the intron pattern of group V6 (intron positions marked in red). Non-canonical introns (positions
marked in green) are exclusively found in some HSP47-related genes from Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Takifugu
rubripes, but not in Danio rerio or other members of group V6. An intron located outside the serpin scaffold of X. tropicalis
HSP47 is depicted in turquoise. Intron positions of human α1-antitrypsin (A1, group V2) are shown in yellow. The characteristic ER retention signal present at the C-terminus of all members of group V6 is printed in white on blue background. Sequence
alignments and intron mapping were accomplished as described in the legend to Figure 2.

terns was analyzed. The list of species investigated
included: man, chicken (Gallus gallus), the clawed frog
(Xenopus tropicalis; X. tropicalis), and several fishes including Danio rerio (D. rerio), Oryzias latipes (O. latipes), Gasterosteus aculeatus (G. aculeatus), Tetraodon nigroviridis (T.
nigroviridis), and Takifugu rubripes (T. rubripes). Several serpin genes, though clearly members of one of the six canonical groups, were found to deflect from the standard
organizations. Like their counterparts in lampreys, angiotensinogen genes of tetrapods and D. rerio exhibit the
canonical gene architecture of group V2, the T. rubripes
orthologue, however, contains two extra introns that split
the exonic sequences at positions 77c and 233c, respectively (Figure 2; non-standard introns are marked in
green). These surplus introns are also present in the orthologues of O. latipes and G. aculeatus, but they are not found

in any other vertebrate serpins. In the current release of the
T. nigroviridis genome, the angiotensinogen gene is not represented. EST data revealed (Additional file 2) that, in G.
aculeatus, the extra introns are indeed spliced out, rejecting
the argument that they are artifacts.
The HCII genes of mammals [29,30], chicken, X. tropicalis
and D. rerio uniformly depict the conserved intron pattern
of group V2. Deviations from the standard structure, however, were observed in lampreys and in several fishes. The
HCII orthologues of O. latipes, G. aculeatus, T. rubripes and
T. nigroviridis each contain a non-standard intron mapping to position 241c (Additional file 1). EST analyses
confirmed expression and correct splicing of the HCII
transcript in O. latipes (Additional file 2). To our knowledge, there are no other vertebrate serpins possessing an

intron at this position. A gain that occurred after the split
of the D. rerio lineage from the other ray-finned fishes
thus may explain appearance of this intron. Another extra
intron in the HCII genes of pufferfishes maps to the inhibitor's N-terminal tail (gene-specific numbering of positions: 85b and 87b for T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis,
respectively). Though also found in O. latipes and G.
aculeatus, this intron here is not considered any further,
due to its location outside the serpin scaffold. Examination of lamprey HCII also revealed unique introns. The
83c intron (α1-antitrypsin numbering) is embedded in a
well-conserved region; its origin, however, is difficult to
evaluate. The others (correctly predicted?) map to the Nterminal extension (gene-specific numbering of positions:
38b and 118c).
Database searches also disclosed members of group V2,
dubbed Spn_94a, with a surplus intron at position 94a
(Additional file 1). In O. latipes, G. aculeatus, T. rubripes
and T. nigroviridis, these genes are flanked by a conserved
set of markers (Additional file 3). The imbedded serpin
genes thus are derived from a common ancestor. Position
94a was previously not known to harbor introns in vertebrate serpins. Inspection of chromosomal gene order
revealed that D. rerio also contains Spn_94a; the extra
intron, however, is missing, suggesting that it was gained
after divergence of the D. rerio lineage. In pufferfishes, two
further members of group V2 with an extra intron, located
at position 215c, were identified (Spn_215c from T.
rubripes and T. nigroviridis, respectively). The origin of
these genes is unclear; the unique surplus intron suggests
that they share a common ancestor (Additional file 1).
In most mammals, chicken, X. tropicalis and in P. marinus,
group V6 encompasses a single member, HSP47, uniformly depicting introns at positions 192a, 225a and
300c. In D. rerio, however, there are three HSP47-related
genes
(Dan_HSP47_1,
Dan_HSP47_2,
and
Dan_HSP47_3), all of which are equipped with the standard set of introns (Figure 3). Neighbor-joining analyses of
HSP47 proteins and reference serpins from groups V1–V5
confirmed phylogenetic clustering of group V6 genes from
D. rerio (not shown), which probably arose as a consequence of genome duplication events in the stem lineage
of ray-finned fishes [31,32]. In the other actinopterygians
investigated, the phylogenetic history of group V6 is less
clear, partly due to the varying status of the still ongoing
genome
sequencing
projects.
Orthologues
of
Dan_HSP47_1, as indicated by the conserved gene order
(Figure 4a) were detected in G. aculeatus, O. latipes and T.
rubripes (dubbed Gast_HSP47_1, Oryz_HSP47_1 and
Fugu_HSP47_1, respectively). In G. aculeatus, a second
intact HSP47 homologue, Gast_HSP47_2, was identified.
Dan_HSP47_2 and Gast_HSP47_2 are orthologous to
each other, since they share a set of flanking markers (Figure 4b) that proved to be reciprocal best hits in BLAST

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/208

searches (not shown). Currently it is not clear, whether
some further HSP47-related sequences present in the
genomes of T. rubripes and O. latipes represent incompletely annotated or defective genes. The only HSP47related sequence detected in the T. nigroviridis genome is
incomplete.
The intron patterns of HSP47 homologues uncover telling
insight into the evolution of group V6 in fishes (Figure 3).
Dan_HSP47_1, Dan_HSP47_2, Dan_HSP47_3, and
HSP47 from P. marinus and tetrapods, respectively, all
depict the standard intron repertoire. Gast_HSP47_1,
Oryz_HSP47_1 and Fugu_HSP47_1, however, contain two
additional introns (positions 36b and 102c, respectively);
Gast_HSP47_2, in contrast, merely possesses the default
introns. These findings suggest that the novel introns,
which are restricted to HSP47_1 orthologues, were
acquired by group V6 during evolution of ray-finned
fishes after divergence of the D. rerio lineage, though an
intron loss scenario cannot be excluded. Two intron gains
or a single, coupled intron gain event are/is sufficient to
explain the exon-intron patterns found in group V6; the
intron removal scenario, in contrast, requires multiple
intron loss events. If such losses had occurred, they must
have affected several taxa, including lampreys, tetrapods
and fishes. Moreover, this scenario also demands that the
same two introns (positions 36b and 102c) were always
deleted in parallel, while all other introns were unaffected. The parallel emergence of introns at positions 77c
and 233c in angiotensinogen genes (Figure 2) provides further support for the intron gain presumption.
In contrast with several intron gains, we detected a single
case of probable intron loss during evolution of vertebrate
serpins. Antithrombin (AT), the only member of group V5,
is a potent thrombin inhibitor in the presence of heparin.
Among other characteristic features, AT orthologues are
easily discernible through a highly conserved sequence
centering around helix D (Additional file 1) that constitutes a major part of the heparin binding region. The AT
genes of tetrapods have introns interrupting the serpin
scaffold at positions 78c, 148c, 191c, 320a and 339c (Figure 1). The orthologues from fishes, however, exhibit an
additional intron at position 262c (Additional file 1). This
intron is also present in D. rerio and in the currently
incompletely annotated AT gene of T. nigroviridis (not
shown). Intron 262c is a standard attribute of group V1
that is believed to share a common ancestor with group
V5 [22]. We therefore suspect that this intron was lost in
AT genes of tetrapods. We were not able to identify this
gene in P. marinus; further tracing of the 262c intron was
therefore not possible.
In serpins from groups V3 and V4, deviations from the
standard structures were not observed (not shown). All
genes from group V3 analyzed featured introns at posiPage 6 of 12

Figuregain in group V6 is restriced to HSP47_1 orthologues
Intron 4
Intron gain in group V6 is restriced to HSP47_1 orthologues. Gene orders reveal that, with the exception of Danio
rerio, non-canonical introns (symbolized by a plus sign) occur exclusively in HSP47_1 orthologues (a), but not in the paralogous
HSP47_2 genes (b) or in HSP47_3 (only known from Danio rerio; not shown). Intron acquisition in HSP47_1 orthologues
occurred during radiation of ray-finned fishes following divergence of the Danio rerio lineage, as suggested by lack of the extra
introns in all other members of group V6, including tetrapods and lampreys.

tions ~86a-90a, 167a, 230a, 290b, 323a, 352a, and 380a.
The intron pattern characteristic of group V4 (positions
67a, 123a, 192a, 238c, 307a) was also conserved.
Features of novel introns
Table 1 summarizes some properties of the non-canonical
introns identified. Their sizes vary from 68 to 178 bp (for

sequences see Additional file 4), about the average range
found for introns of T. rubripes [33]. All novel introns are
bounded by canonical GT-AG splice signals, the GC content extends from 26.8 to 55.9%. Five out of seven introns
interrupt the open reading frame between codons (phase
c) and one each after the first or the second base of the
codon, respectively. No similarities to known complex

repetitive elements were detected. In five out of seven
cases the novel introns are embedded in a fairly well conserved sequence environment with no insertions or deletions. In contrast, the sequences flanking the 94a intron of
Spn_94a orthologues cannot be aligned without introducing gaps (Additional file 1). These considerations are not
applicable to the 215c intron of Spn_215c, since the ancestor is unknown. Intron gain was proposed to occur at preferred locations (consensus sequence: C/AAG↑N),
referred to as proto-splice sites [34,35]. We examined the
sequences enclosing the insertion points of non-standard
introns in serpins of ray-finned fishes (Table 1). Generally,
the sequences flanking the intron insertion points are concordant with the proto-splice sites proposed. We note that
a relatively high fraction of bases immediately adjacent to
the splice acceptor site are pyrimidine residues.

Discussion
Intron gain has been reported to occur very rarely in many
metazoan lineages, including mammals and other vertebrates [4,5]. To our surprise we disclosed multiple newly
acquired introns by probing a vertebrate protein superfamily, the serpins, while a single intron was presumably

lost. The most clear-cut example for intron gain is angiotensinogen that, in lampreys, tetrapods and D. rerio,
depicts the typical exon/intron pattern of group V2. The
novel introns at positions 77c and 233c, like all other
non-standard introns identified, are exclusively found in
a group of ray-finned fishes that emerged after the split of
the D. rerio lineage. None of the novel intron positions is
found in any paralogues of group V2 or in any other vertebrate serpins known. Thus, from a parsimony standpoint, the view that these introns were acquired de novo is
more likely than the alternative possibility that these
introns were inherited from a common ancestor. The
novel introns were apparently not acquired at the expense
of adjacent introns, as concomitant loss of such sequences
was not observed. Since there are no reports of intron gain
in serpins of other vertebrates, our findings may reflect an
episode of enhanced intron acquisition that happened
during radiation of ray-finned fishes. Several of the few
other well-documented intron gains also occurred during
diversification of these fishes [36-39].
HSP47 genes are especially informative concerning both
the time period and the processes possibly associated with
intron birth. During evolution of ray-finned fishes, group
V6 was split into three lineages, probably a consequence
of whole genome and/or large fragment duplications. The
extra introns at positions 36b and 102c, however, were
acquired only by HSP47_1 orthologues after divergence of
the D. rerio lineage. HSP47_2 from G. aculeatus, in contrast, depicts the standard intron pattern, just as HSP47_1,
HSP47_2 and HSP47_3 from D. rerio and the members of
group V6 from lampreys and tetrapods. These findings
indicate that intron gains were not associated with the
fish-specific genome duplication events, they rather support the view that co-existence of paralogues may favor
maintenance of introns once gained. Phylogenetic data
[40] locate birth of all new introns in serpins to a time
period about 320-190 mya (Figure 5).
Except for Spn_94a, the insertion points of novel introns
are exact, as no deletions or insertions at the flanking
sequences are evident. Many serpins tolerate indels without functional impairment, especially in loops connecting
α-helices and β-strands, a noteworthy aspect that should
be kept in mind in the discussion of intron gain mechanisms. Inspection of nucleotide sequences in the neighborhood of novel introns revealed compliance with the
proto-splice site sequences proposed [34,35]. A relatively
high fraction of bases immediately adjacent to the splice
acceptor site are pyrimidine residues, possibly biased due
to the limited number of samples analyzed or due to subsequent selection processes. Alternatively, this finding
may indicate that the specifications required at the 3'-side
of intron insertion sites are low.

only entailed loss of complete genes, but also affected
intergenic and intronic sequences. Intron sizes, for
instance, are considerably larger in D. rerio than in pufferfishes. It remains to be investigated, whether all these
sequences have gone without leaving any traces behind.
Loss of genomic sequences is inevitably associated with
DNA breakage, requiring repair and recombination. The
involvement of such processes in intron acquisition
should therefore be considered; however, like for the
other intron gain mechanisms suggested, conclusive evidence of a causal relationship between DNA breakage/
repair and de novo intron formation is lacking as yet.

genes. The estimated divergence times (in mya), taken from
ref. [40], are marked with blue arrows. The time interval of
intron gains in ray-finned fishes is indicated (red arrow).

Several mechanisms have been claimed to be responsible
for birth of introns [2,41,42]. Key to most of the proposals
is duplication events operating at some stage. A popular
mechanism thought to mediate intron gain involves
transposons. A distinguishing feature of fish genomes is
their diversity of retrotransposable elements, notably retrotransposons, some of which were active in recent times
[33,43,44]. However, we could not detect any sequences
in non-standard introns sharing similarity with known
repetitive elements, participation of duplication-dependent transposons with intron gain therefore remains elusive. Preferential loss of such elements from newly
acquired introns, however, cannot be excluded. In two
recently described cases of intron acquisition, similarity to
other genomic sequences was also not observed [7].
We consider that various processes might be responsible
for intron birth, not necessarily related with the events
responsible for their primordial emergence. Excision of
introns, probably created by expansion of simple repeats
or complex repetitive elements [36,45] or generated by
intronization of exon sequences [41], demonstrates that
the spliceosome can do its job as long as the essential
splice signals are present, irrespective of how the intron
was created. Since we were not able to find support in
favor of currently discussed mechanisms of intron gain
(reviewed in [2,9-11]), we consider that introns might
also be created by other means. After the fish-specific
whole genome duplication, compaction processes
resulted in reduction of genome sizes in many actinopterygians [33,46-48]. Deprivation of genomic DNA not

Genome-scale or local amplification of genes might conceivably favor gain and maintenance of novel introns,
since unaffected copies are left in the genome. The appearance of novel introns in the serpin superfamily, however,
was apparently not associated with the fish-specific
genome duplication that preceded radiation of ray-finned
fishes [32]. In current phylogenetic scenarios, divergence
of D. rerio, which lacks all of the non-canonical introns,
antedates the split of the lineage that experienced intron
gains. Retention of introns once acquired might indeed be
favored by the co-existence of paralogues, relative frequencies of intron gains in single versus multi-copy gene
families, however, are discussed controversially [49,50].

Conclusion
By a comprehensive analysis of lineages pre- and postdating the split of vertebrates, the founding period for major
groups of vertebrate serpins was ascertained. Following
establishment of the canonical exon-intron patterns
before or close to diversification of lampreys, a lineage of
ray-finned fishes is shown to have experienced multiple
intron gains. Remarkably, in two genes concomitant
appearance of non-canonical introns is observed, suggesting that intron gains may even happen in parallel or in a
rapidly consecutive manner. These data strongly suggest
that intron acquisition occurs in at least some vertebrate
taxa. The observation that all intron gain events were
found in a lineage of ray-finned fishes that underwent
genome compaction, leads us to assume that DNA breakage/repair processes may enable or facilitate intron acquisition. Angiotensinogen, HCII, and HSP47 were identified
as ancient members of the serpin superfamily in vertebrates.

Cloning and sequencing of serpin cDNAs and genes
The isolation of poly(A)-RNA and genomic DNA, the synthesis of cDNA, PCR amplification of serpin cDNA fragments using various sets of degenerate primers, and
cloning of 5'- and 3'-cDNA ends followed published procedures [20,51]. DNA sequences (Additional file 2) have
been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database.

Sequence data analysis and intron annotation
Genomic data for serpins from human, chicken [52], X.
tropicalis [53], D. rerio [54], G. aculeatus [55], O. latipes
[56], T. rubripes [33] and T. nigroviridis [31] were extracted
from the Ensembl genome browser, release 51 [57], or in
the case of P. marinus [58], from PreEnsembl (http://
www.ensembl.org). Sequences from the B. floridae
genome were gathered from the JGI genome browser
(http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Brafl1/Brafl1.home.html). EST
and cDNA data mining included searches in the NCBI
trace archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and in the
UCSC genome browser [59], applying the BLAST algorithm. Some gene models were refined using EST data
(Additional file 2).

All intron positions predicted by gene models were examined visually, corrected and amended manually, if necessary. Whenever cDNA or EST sequences were available,
intron positions were checked by means of GENEWISE
[60]. Protein sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW
[61] with some manual improvements. Intron positions
were projected onto the sequence of mature human α1antitrypsin as described [22]. All intron locations allude
to the reference protein, unless stated otherwise. Only
introns mapping to the conserved serpin scaffold (i.e.
positions 33 to 394 of human α1-antitrypsin) were considered.
