A horizontal gene transfer supported the
evolution of an early metazoan biomineralization
strategy
Daniel J Jackson1*, Luciana Macis1, Joachim Reitner1 and Gert Wörheide2,3

Abstract
Background: The synchronous and widespread adoption of the ability to biomineralize was a defining event for
metazoan evolution during the late Precambrian/early Cambrian 545 million years ago. However our understanding
on the molecular level of how animals first evolved this capacity is poor. Because sponges are the earliest
branching phylum of biomineralizing metazoans, we have been studying how biocalcification occurs in the
coralline demosponge Astrosclera willeyana.
Results: We have isolated and characterized a novel protein directly from the calcified spherulites of A. willeyana.
Using three independent lines of evidence (genomic architecture of the gene in A. willeyana, spatial expression of
the gene product in A. willeyana and genomic architecture of the gene in the related demosponge Amphimedon
queenslandica), we show that the gene that encodes this protein was horizontally acquired from a bacterium, and
is now highly and exclusively expressed in spherulite forming cells.
Conclusions: Our findings highlight the ancient and close association that exists between sponges and bacteria,
and provide support for the notion that horizontal gene transfer may have been an important mechanism that
supported the evolution of this early metazoan biomineralisation strategy.

Background
The fossil record of early animal life could be briefly
summarized as a period dominated by soft-bodied
organisms that were replaced at the dawn of the Phanerozoic by an unprecedented diversity and disparity of
animals able to form mineralized structures [1-4].
Decoding the genetic and molecular mechanisms that
instruct the assembly of mineralized body parts is therefore of great importance if we are to have a complete
understanding of how complex animal life evolved.
Because sponges evolved the capacity to construct a skeleton early on in their evolution [1], and are widely
thought to be the earliest branching metazoan phylum
[5,6], we have been investigating the genetic and molecular basis of biocalcification in the coralline demosponge Astrosclera willeyana [7,8]. Some coralline
sponges, such as A. willeyana, construct their calcified

skeletons by accreting individual microscopic spherulites
together (Figure 1a-c), a strategy employed by reef forming sponges known from the Permian and Triassic [9].
Recently we demonstrated that spherulites in A. willeyana are initially formed by calcifying the organic
remains of degraded bacteria [8] via the activity of at
least one highly conserved biomineralizing enzyme [7].
Here we show that a major proteinaceous component of
the A. willeyana skeleton, which is likely to be directly
involved in spherulite formation, was horizontally transferred from a bacterium into the A. willeyana genome.

Results and Discussion
Isolation and evolutionary characterization of the novel
biocalcification protein Spherulin

Using previously described de-mineralization, protein
extraction and separation techniques [7], our continuing
efforts to characterize the spherulitic proteome of A.
willeyana identified a prominent protein of 52 kDa on
SDS-PAGE gels. This band was excised, and an amino
terminal fragment sequenced by Edman degradation.

The resulting peptide was used to design degenerate
PCR primers which amplified a fragment of DNA from
a cDNA library. This was cloned, sequenced and used
to design gene specific primers that allowed the fulllength cDNA to be isolated (Additional file 1). Due to
the association of this protein with spherulites we have
named it ‘Spherulin’.
Initial BLAST searches using partial RACE fragments
returned hits against uncharacterized proteins with similarity to sugar transporters derived exclusively from bacteria. Conversely, exhaustive BLAST searches directed
against a wide phylogenetic range of eukaryotic unicellular and multicellular draft or complete genomes (more
than 270) did not return any positive hits (see Additional
file 2 for a complete list of eukaryotic genomes searched).
One exception to this was the identification of a clear
Spherulin homolog in the draft genome of the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica. This restricted phylogenetic distribution of Spherulin led us to the initial
hypothesis that the poriferan Spherulin sequences were
in fact derived from the abundant bacterial communities
known to exist throughout A. willeyana and A. queenslandica, and which are particularly numerous within the
cells that initiate spherulite formation in A. willeyana
[8,9]. However, once we isolated the full length mRNA
from A. willeyana the presence of a putative poly-A signal and poly-A tail (Additional file 1) suggested that this
may not be a bacterially derived gene product, and could
be the product of a horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
Three independent lines of evidence demonstrate
Spherulin is now located within poriferan genomes

To test this hypothesis we first localized Awi-Spherulin
expression using whole mount in situ hybridization
(WMISH). These experiments clearly show that AwiSpherulin is expressed in the same spherulite forming cells
that Astrosclerin is expressed in (Figure 1f-k), a gene we
previously demonstrated to be involved in spherulite formation [7]. Furthermore, endobiotic bacteria associated
with A. willeyana are visible following WMISH, and
Spherulin expression was not detected in these bacterial
cells after multiple rounds of WMISH (data not shown).
We also investigated the genomic architectures of Awiand Aqu-Spherulin. We amplified Awi-Spherulin from
genomic DNA and found that the amplicon was 940 bp
larger than the cDNA derived product. The 940 bp of
additional sequence possessed the characteristics of a
typical spliceosomal intron with classic GT-AG donor/
acceptor sites [10], a polypyrimidine tract 5’ of the acceptor site [11], and several adenine residues immediately
upstream of this tract that could act as intron break
point residues [12] (Figure 2a). The presence of this splicesomal intron indicates that the Awi-Spherulin gene is
now located within the A. willeyana genome.

While the A. queenslandica Spherulin homolog is
intron-less, genomic sequence immediately flanking
Aqu-Spherulin codes for metazoan specific genes (Virilizer and a lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase), indicating
that Aqu-Spherulin is located within the A. queenslandica genome (Figure 2b).
The deep ancestry of the Spherulin HGT event has
removed evidence of Spherulin’s bacterial heritage

Phylogenetic incongruence, where evolutionary relationships are well established, can indicate a history of HGT
activity [13], and is considered to be a gold standard for
the demonstration of HGT ancestry [14]. We therefore
performed phylogenetic analyses using a range of Spherulin sequences. All of our analyses grouped the two poriferan Spherulins together with high support, while all
other prokaryotic sequences formed distantly related
clades (Figure 2c). While this result is not phylogenetically incongruent (sponge Spherulin proteins would be
expected to form an outgroup to all other prokaryotic
Spherulin-like sequences in the absence of HGT), it
does not provide evidence against HGT. It does however, provide information regarding the origins of the
poriferan Spherulin gene. Because Awi- and Aqu-Spherulin form a well separated and supported clade, it is
clear that an HGT event established this gene in a common ancestor of A. willeyana and A. queenslandica, and
must therefore have occurred during or prior to the
Triassic 265-220 MYA when these two species of
sponge shared a common ancestor [9]. Because of the
long branch that leads to the two poriferan genes, they
must have since been evolving under pressures distinct
from those of the prokaryotic Spherulin homologs.
Further evidence for the deep ancestry of the Spherulin
HGT is provided by a composition analysis. Codon usage
typically differs significantly between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms [15], and can therefore be used to
detect cases of HGT [16-18]. The level of gene expression
often influences codon usage bias, with highly expressed
genes typically possessing a greater bias [19]. Accordingly,
we first quantified levels of Spherulin expression from
three A. willeyana individuals relative to six other genes
using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Awi-Spherulin is
expressed on average 20 times higher than the previously
characterized spherulite-forming gene Astrosclerin [7], and
at almost 28% the level of actin (Figure 3), indicating it is
a highly expressed gene. We then surveyed the relative
synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of 181 A. willeyana evolutionarily conserved genes (Additional file 3), and compared these RSCU patterns with Awi-Spherulin and
Spherulin homologs from 10 prokaryotes. The high level
of Awi-Spherulin expression has clearly shaped its codon
usage bias such that it is now more similar to eukaryotic
genes that have no HGT ancestry (Figure 3). This result

Figure 2 Genomic architectures of Awi- and Aqu-Spherulin and
their evolutionary relationships with homologous prokaryotic
sequences. (A) Awi-Spherulin possesses a signal sequence
(highlighted grey) indicating it is located extracellularly, within
which a 940 bp intron is located. GT/AG splice sites (highlighted

break point residues (arrows) are indicated. (B) Aqu-Spherulin is

supports the hypothesis that the Spherulin-HGT event
took place hundreds of millions of years ago. Intriguingly,
A. queenslandica does not form any calcified structures,
suggesting that the functions of the two poriferan Spherulins have diverged from each other. In support of this we
could not detect any Aqu-Spherulin transcripts among
66,000+ A. queenslandica ESTs derived from 3 distinct
larval cDNA libraries, suggesting that Aqu-Spherulin is
not expressed during development.
While there are many examples of HGT between prokaryotes [20], well established examples of HGT from
prokaryotic into metazoan organisms are relatively few,
with some examples revealed to be artifacts of improper
analysis [13,21-23]. When they are detected, prokaryotic
to eukaryotic HGTs often reflect relatively recent events
because commonly employed methods to detect them
(phylogenetic incongruence and composition analyses)
require the maintenance of a phylogenetic signal [14].

Figure 3 Comparative qPCR analysis and codon usage bias of
A. willeyana and prokaryotic genes. The bar chart illustrates the
expression levels of six A. willeyana house keeping genes quantified
relative to Awi-Spherulin. Error bars are the standard error of 3
replicates derived from 3 individuals. The scatter plot is a
correspondence analysis of relative synonymous codon usage
(RSCU) of 181 A. willeyana genes. Superimposed are the RSCUs of
10 prokaryotic Spherulin homologs (grey circles) and Awi-Spherulin
(red circle). Also indicated by color are the genes used in the qPCR
analysis.

Indeed the only method that would detect the Spherulin
HGT is a phyletic pattern analysis [24,25]. In this type
of analysis the phyletic distribution of the gene of interest does not reflect the known evolutionary relationships
of the species it is found in. The number of independent
gene losses that must be invoked in order to account for
such a distribution suggests that another explanation
(HGT) should be considered. Our fortuitous identification of the HGT that established Spherulin in an ancestral poriferan genome highlights the fact that
phylogenetic incongruence and composition based analyses may miss HGTs between clades of organisms that
either have poor genomic resources, and/or represent
HGTs that occurred in the distant past.
While the HGT we describe here may have been the
result of a transfer of a sponge gene into a bacterial
endobiont, this is extremely unlikely due to the phyletic distribution of Spherulin homologs throughout
the Proteobacteria; Spherulin homologs are present in
delta- and gamma-proteobacteria (Figure 2), and can
also be detected in alpha-proteobacteria and enterobacteria. Such a distribution could only be possible if
the sponge Spherulin gene had been horizontally transferred from an ancestral sponge into each of these distinct bacterial lineages independently. Alternatively,
sponges would need to have been present at a time
when the last common ancestor of these bacterial
lineages existed, a scenario not supported by fossil or
molecular data.

The Spherulin gene likely supported the evolution of the
Astrosclera biomineralization strategy

HGTs are thought to often involve the transfer of enzymes
involved in metabolic processes [26, however see, 27 for an
alternative view]. Given its similarity with sugar transporters, the modern and/or ancestral function of Awi-Spherulin suggests that the Spherulin-HGT falls within this
category. It is tempting to speculate that Awi-Spherulin is
functionally required to supply the energy necessary for
the metabolically demanding process of biocalcification,
however such a hypothesis awaits support by functional
characterization of Awi-Spherulin. Unfortunately, in vivo
manipulation of Awi-Spherulin expression or translation is
currently not possible as methods to culture A. willeyana
in the laboratory have not been established. Additionally
there is no functional data available for any of the prokaryotic Spherulin homologs. Nonetheless, the presence of
Awi-Spherulin protein in purified spherulites, and its high
level of expression exclusively in spherulite forming cells is
strong evidence that it plays a direct role in biocalcification
in A. willeyana.

Conclusions
Sponges are well known for the abundant bacterial
communities they harbor [28], a condition that significantly increases the likelihood of HGTs [14]. We provide here the first example of a HGT event into a
sponge genome from a prokaryote, which serves to
highlight the intimacy of the sponge-bacteria relationship. The fact that Awi-Spherulin is most likely involved
in skeletogenesis suggests that this HGT event may
have contributed to the evolution of A. willeyana’s
bodyplan. With the growing availability of metazoan
genomes, and our understanding of the mechanisms
that support the mobilization of genetic material, more
instances of HGT into and between eukaryotic genomes
will certainly be revealed. We predict that such events
will often be associated with fundamental evolutionary
changes to gene regulation, gene repertoire and morphological diversity.
Methods
Spherulites were isolated from snap frozen A. willeyana
individuals collected around Lizard Island (Great Barrier
Reef, Australia) and during the Deep DownUnder Expedition (http://www.deepdownunder.de) at various reefs on
the Queensland Plateau (Australia). A prominent band at
52 kDa was excised from a standard 12% SDS-PAGE gel
and sequenced by Edman degradation. From this sequence
a degenerate primer (5’-TGICCDATRTCIGGDATISWRTTRTADATICCIAC-3’) was designed and used to
isolate a 3’ fragment from a cDNA library cloned into a l
TripleX vector (Clontech). 3’ and 5’ RACE fragments were
subsequently isolated and assembled into a putative full

length mRNA. The significant BLAST hit of Awi-Spherulin against S. aurantiaca was statistically tested and confirmed using PRSS3 [29]. WMISH was performed as
previously described [7] using 1,234 bp DIG labeled sense
and anti-sense probes. Comparative quantitative RT-PCR
was performed using a Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q machine
and SYBR green chemistry. Primer sequences to all genes
are available in Additional file 4. For each A. willeyana
individual Spherulin was set as the calibrator. A set of
Spherulin protein homologs was downloaded from GenBank and aligned using ClustalW2 with gap opening and
gap extension penalties set to 3 and 1.8 respectively (see
Additional file 5 for the alignment). Phylogenetic analyses
were conducted using MrBayes v. 3.1.2. Four runs each
with 8 chains were run for 1.1 million generations at a
temperature of 0.2. The first 25% of these trees were discarded as burnin. A correspondence analysis of relative
synonymous codon usage was conducted using CodonW
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/codonw/). A. willeyana
CDSs derived from an EST collection were assembled and
searched against NCBI’s nr database in order to unambiguously identify correct reading frames and start and
stop codons from highly conserved genes (minimum
BLASTx e value 10-6). Sequences with high similarity to
bacterial sequences were removed leaving a total of 181 A.
willeyana CDSs (Additional file 3).
