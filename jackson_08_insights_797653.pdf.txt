Abstract
Background: Bodo saltans is a free-living kinetoplastid and among the closest relatives of the
trypanosomatid parasites, which cause such human diseases as African sleeping sickness,
leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. A B. saltans genome sequence will provide a free-living
comparison with parasitic genomes necessary for comparative analyses of existing and future
trypanosomatid genomic resources. Various coding regions were sequenced to provide a
preliminary insight into the bodonid genome sequence, relative to trypanosomatid sequences.
Results: 0.4 Mbp of B. saltans genome was sequenced from 12 distinct regions and contained 178
coding sequences. As in trypanosomatids, introns were absent and %GC was elevated in coding
regions, greatly assisting in gene finding. In the regions studied, roughly 60% of all genes had
homologs in trypanosomatids, while 28% were Bodo-specific. Intergenic sequences were typically
short, resulting in higher gene density than in trypanosomatids. Although synteny was typically
conserved for those genes with trypanosomatid homologs, strict colinearity was rarely observed
because gene order was regularly disrupted by Bodo-specific genes.
Conclusion: The B. saltans genome contains both sequences homologous to trypanosomatids and
sequences never seen before. Structural similarities suggest that its assembly should be solvable,
and, although de novo assembly will be necessary, existing trypanosomatid projects will provide
some guide to annotation. A complete genome sequence will provide an effective ancestral model
for understanding the shared and derived features of known trypanosomatid genomes, but it will
also identify those kinetoplastid genome features lost during the evolution of parasitism.

Background
The Kinetoplastida (Euglenozoa) are unicellular flagellates that include the trypanosomatid parasites, most
notably Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi and Leishmania spp.
These organisms cause substantial mortality and morbidity in humans and their livestock worldwide as the causative agents of African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease
and leishmaniasis respectively. Bodo saltans is a free-living
heterotroph found worldwide in freshwater and marine

habitats. It possesses the diagnostic kinetoplastid features,
such as flagella sited within a specialised flagellar pocket,
glycolytic processes confined to a dedicated organelle (the
'glycosome'), and the characteristic concentration of
mitochondrial DNA at the base of the flagellum (the
'kinetoplast') [1,2]. When comparing trypanosomatid
parasites with each other, or collectively with other
eukaryotes, the value of B. saltans is as a non-parasitic near
relative, (i.e., an 'outgroup'), that can illuminate their key

evolutionary transitions. Five draft genome sequences
exist for Trypanosoma spp. and four for Leishmania spp. [37]; these will be augmented with further strains and other
non-human parasites in the coming years [8]. With such
excellent comparative resources in place or in development, there is a critical need for a non-trypanosomatid
outgroup. In effect, it will provide a model of the ancestral
trypanosomatid to distinguish those derived parts of the
parasite genomes (i.e., unique trypanosomatid adaptations) from those which are a legacy of the free-living
ancestor. For instance, such a model will help to resolve
whether trypanosomatids previously possessed an algal
plastid from which 'plant-like' genes in trypanosomatid
genomes are derived [9-11]. As a prelude to a complete B.
saltans genome sequencing effort, this study sought to
establish an initial understanding of the bodonid
genome, its structure and content relative to the trypanosomatids.
The most recent kinetoplastid phylogeny has shown that
trypanosomatid parasites are just one of many independent acquisitions of parasitism, indeed, a relatively minor
component of total diversity [12-15]. Nonetheless, they
are, naturally, the most important aspect of kinetoplastid
diversity. Many features of their completed genome
sequences emphasised the common ancestry of T. brucei,
T. cruzi and Leishmania spp., especially with respect to
gene repertoire and order [16], but their critical pathological differences were also evident at the genomic level. The
three human parasites cause distinct diseases; their
genomes contain enigmatic adaptations related to pathogenesis and immune evasion, for instance the bloodstream expression site in T. brucei from which its variant
surface glycoproteins (VSG) are expressed [17,18], and
surface antigen families in general [16]. Without an historical dimension, these features cannot be compared, nor
understood in an evolutionary context. As it is among the
closest bodonid relatives of the trypanosomatids [19],
Bodo saltans is a suitable outgroup to address three principal comparative issues: i) understanding how human
trypanosomatid parasites acquired their distinct pathological strategies; ii) understanding how the ancestral
trypanosomatid became parasitic in terms of derived
innovations (e.g., cell surfaces) and loss of genomic repertoire; iii) understanding how typical kinetoplastid features (e.g., glycosomes) evolved and how these might
have been modified for parasitism.
Quite what to expect from a bodonid genome sequence is
an open question. Beyond the basic kinetoplastid features
named above, the biological differences between bodonids and trypanosomatids are striking. While B. saltans is
a bacteriovore, especially prevalent in polluted waters or
other environments with high bacterial densities [1],
trypanosomatids are obligate parasites inhabiting a nutri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/594

ent-rich, but ultimately hostile, host environment, and
adept at exploiting their eutrophic environment to maximise proliferation and transmission. By contrast, B. saltans preys on bacterial cells [1,2] and is probably adapted
for resource acquisition within its relatively oligotrophic
environment. Although bodonids and trypanosomatids
are all flagellates, trypanosomatids attach their single flagellum to the cell surface to generate motile force, whereas
the anterior flagellum in B. saltans is modified with hairlike mastigonemes, which may assist prey location during
feeding [2,20-22]. There are wider cytoskeletal differences
also; the subpellicular microtubular cortex is instrumental
in maintaining the numerous cell forms adopted by
trypanosomatids [23], but is reduced in bodonids, (which
lack complex developmental stages), to the region around
the cytostome [2,24]. Perhaps most importantly for
understanding the evolution of parasitism, we can expect
substantial differences between trypanosomatid cell surfaces that function primarily to manipulate and frustrate
the host immune response and bodonid membranes that
are perhaps largely concerned with cellular homeostasis.
Rather than providing definitive answers to these questions, the preliminary sequence data presented here provides an initial insight into a few comprehensively
resolved locations in the B. saltans genome, indicating
what to expect from gene content and arrangement, and
testing the feasibility of a complete sequence project. The
sequence contigs were compared with corresponding
regions in trypanosomatids (based on conserved gene
order, where this existed), to examine gene content and
the conservation of gene order (i.e., colinearity) and,
therefore, the potential for using trypanosomatid genome
sequences as scaffolds to assist assembly and annotation
of the B. saltans sequence.

Results
Gene structure
Clones were selected from the B. saltans fosmid library
according to random end-sequences and positive results
for specific PCR probes. Inserts from 12 fosmid clones
were shotgun sequenced, comprising 0.403 Mbp in total
and an average size of 33.6 Kbp. Table 1 describes the
composition of the 12 contigs in terms of the affinity
shown by each putative coding sequence to sequence
databases. 178 putative coding sequences are specified;
genes could be predicted by eye because of a definite elevation in GC content in coding regions. Subsequent
matches to sequence databases showed these features to
be correct. The boundaries between coding and flanking
regions are marked by a transition from GC-rich to ATrich signatures; the sequences shown in Figure 1 clearly
demonstrate the GC troughs that appear between coding
sequences. This pattern is repeated in other contigs, as
shown in subsequent figures. Gene density is high relative

to corresponding regions in the L. major and T. brucei
genome sequences, reflected by the consistently short
intercoding sequences across all contigs (average = 377.2
bp). Figure 2 compares the gene order of one region (average interceding sequence length = 439.7 bp) with positionally orthologous regions in L. major (average = 1480.6
bp) and T. brucei (average = 1129.4 bp); this, like most
fosmid inserts, contains more genes in Bodo than in
trypanosomatids.
Gene content
Table 1 shows that 106/178 coding sequences (59.6%)
are homologs of known trypanosomatid genes. The percentage nucleotide identity between bodonid and
trypanosomatid proteins varies greatly; genes of known
conservatism display high identity (Î±-tubulin, 98%; Î²tubulin, 99%; HSP70, 95%; GAPDH, 81%), but on average coding sequences are 44.38% identical and the most
abundant identity class is 30â39%. Hence, most
orthologs in these two classes have diverged by two-thirds
or more. Of those coding sequences without trypanosomatid homologs, 20 show homology with other
eukaryotes, 2 are of bacterial affinity, and the remainder
(28.1%) are without matches to any database, i.e., Bodospecific. Despite the bacterial contamination inevitable in
DNA preparations (see methods), we can be certain that
these bacterial-type coding sequences are not artefacts
because they are present in fosmid inserts otherwise composed of eukaryotic sequences, and individual sequence
clones span both the bacterial-type gene and surrounding
eukaryotic-type sequence. Although present in B. saltans,
some of the familiar genes intensively studied in trypanosomatids are found in novel contexts. Figure 1 describes
tandem gene arrays of HSP70 and tubulin, which are
found in locations unlike those in trypanosomatids. An
alternating tandem array containing Î± and Î²-tubulin is
found in two distinct inserts (Figure 1b and 1c); Î± and Î²tubulin isoforms contain no amino acid differences but
had dissimilar (unalignable) 3' untranscribed regions.

Coding sequences without trypanosomatid homologs
were compared to sequence and structural databases (see
Table 2). Many of the gene products are homologous to
proteins beyond the Kinetoplastida, suggesting that they
are core eukaryotic proteins subsequently lost from
trypanosomatids; for example, contiguous genes in Figure
1a homologous to a GPI-anchored protein in plants and
fungi (16273â17686 bp) and a hypothetical gene in
Metazoa (18275â19486 bp). Gene products in other
regions (not shown) contain protein domains known
elsewhere, for example an ABC transporter protein (clone
'5 e 15', 21065 bp) and a nucleotide-sugar transporter
protein (clone '45 a 12', 41227 bp), strongly indicating
that these are Bodo-specific members of ubiquitous gene
families. Some otherwise uncharacterised hypothetical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/594

proteins are predicted to expressed on the cell surface. The
region shown in Figure 3a is notable not only for the base
composition of coding regions and admixture of trypanosomatid and Bodo-specific genes mentioned above, but
also for a hypothetical protein (16737â17978 bp) with 7
predicted transmembrane helices and a signal peptide.
Table 2 contains other examples of Bodo-specific hypothetical genes predicted to be surface expressed, including
those shown in Figure 1a (27014â28063 bp) and b
(16869â18011 bp).
Colinearity
The extent of conserved gene order, or colinearity,
between bodonid and trypanosomatid genome sequences
was assessed using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT,
see methods). One region of excellent colinearity is
shown in Figure 2 and, despite disruption by some
eukaryotic genes not seen in trypanosomatids, this contig
corresponds unmistakably with chromosome 18 in L.
major and chromosome 10 in T. brucei. Conversely, the
presence of so many non-trypanosomatid genes meant
that colinearity disappears entirely in some locations, as
shown in Figure 1. Across the 12 genomic regions however, both patterns were atypical; most regions shows brief
patches of colinearity, perhaps 2 or 3 genes with conserved synteny, set among larger regions of Bodo-specific
genes or homologs to trypanosomatid genes from elsewhere in the genome. In this sense, the sequence presented in Figure 3 is representative because several coding
sequences are homologs of trypanosomatid genes on
chromosomes 13 (L. major) and 11 (T. brucei); these are
roughly colinear but the order is disrupted by genes
present on other chromosomes or by Bodo-specific genes.

Discussion
In this study, various locations in B. saltans genome,
amounting to ~0.4 Mbp, were sequenced. Assuming that
the bodonid genome is approximately the same size as a
trypanosomatid haploid genome, i.e., 35â55 Mbp [16],
these sequences comprise ~1% of the complete genome
sequence, which will therefore contain roughly 14,000
genes. The success and utility of a B. saltans genome
project will depend on its relationship with existing
trypanosomatid genome sequences. This study shows that
coding regions of the B. saltans genome share several
structural features with trypanosomatids, indicating that
the project is both feasible and likely to provide a useful
comparative resource. Putative B. saltans genes lack
introns, as in most trypanosomatid genes [3-5]. They display a conspicuous elevation in GC content, which will
greatly assist gene finding. No evidence of strand-switching was observed in B. saltans, corroborating the view that
it operates polycistronic transcription [25], i.e., transcription of many contiguous loci within a single nascent transcript [26-28], which is subsequently trans-spliced and

polyadenylated to produce mature mRNA, as in trypanosomatids [29-33].
Although the arrangement of coding regions along the
bodonid chromosome may be conserved with trypanosomatids, it is clear that gene order was not. The extent of
conserved synteny, or rather colinear gene order, between
bodonid and trypanosomatid genomes is of particular
importance to the assembly of any B. saltans genome
sequence. The coding regions presented here indicate that
trypanosomatid genome sequences will be of limited

value in the global assembly of a B. saltans genome
sequence. Strict colinearity was not normally observed, if
only because of the large number of Bodo-specific genes
interposed between trypanosomatid homologs. Colinearity tended to persist over a distance of 3â5 genes, although
some regions displayed conspicuous conservation (e.g.,
Figure 2), while others showed none at all (e.g., Figure 1).
Therefore, this initial exploration of the B. saltans genome
demonstrates that it should be possible to resolve a complete genome sequence, but, while the existing trypanosomatid resources will provide some useful guides for

annotation, they could not be used as scaffolds for assembly, which should proceed de novo.
The purpose of a completed B. saltans genome sequence
would be for understanding the evolution of trypanosomatid genome sequences. The mixture of familiar and
novel features in the regions sequenced here indicates the
value of a bodonid genome sequence in distinguishing
trypanosomatid characters inherited from free-living
ancestors (and still shared with them) from characters
evolved since the origin of trypanosomatids. Hence, the
first application would be in determining which parts of
the trypanosomatid genome reflect the genomic legacy
inherited from free-living ancestors, and show how they
have been co-opted and modified for parasitism. Bodonid
and trypanosomatid cells share various structural features,
principally those that characterise kinetoplastid cells.
Bodonids arrange their mitochondrial DNA in kinetoplasts, although their position within the cell differs from
trypanosomatids [1], and conduct their glycolytic pathways within a dedicated organelle (the glycosome) [2].
Bodonids construct their flagella in a similar manner to
trypanosomatids, but deploy them very differently [1].
While B. saltans uses one flagellum for movement and
another for feeding, trypanosomatids flagella perform
their motility function within the context of their sophisticated cell forms.
One might expect these structural similarities to be
reflected at the genomic level. Î±- and Î²-tubulin, the proteins that facilitate the development of flagella in trypanosomatids, are known to be arranged in tandem gene
arrays, with an alternating, heterotypic Î±-Î² array in
Trypanosoma spp. and distinct, monotypic Î± and Î² arrays
in Leishmania spp. [34-37]. Bodonids were shown to share

the alternating conformation, suggesting that Leishmania
spp. and their relatives had abolished the ancestral locus
and evolved novel genomic repertoires [38]. However,
two B. saltans regions containing tubulin in this study
show that modification of tubulin repertoire has also
occurred in Trypanosoma, since neither of the Î±-Î² arrays in
B. saltans was found at the genomic position occupied in
trypanosomes. This demonstrates the utility of the B. saltans genome in resolving the evolutionary causes of structural
or
compositional
differences
between
trypanosomatid genomes.
The second application of a B. saltans genome sequence
would be to identify which components of the free-living
legacy have been lost from trypanosomatids, and therefore, how reductive genome evolution has contributed to
the parasite genomes. Table 2 describes many predicted
proteins identified in B. saltans that have no trypanosomatid homologs. Among these, mostly Bodo-specific, genes
are membrane transporters, various protein kinases, and
other proteins containing domains commonly associated
with cell surfaces. These and other Bodo-specific proteins
must include those metabolism pathways, intracellular
transport, cellular signalling and subcellular structures
that exist in free-living kinetoplastids, but which have
been deleted during the evolution of parasitism. Many of
these proteins will be widespread among eukaryotic lineages, as is evident in Table 2; yet we should also expect to
encounter a considerable genetic repertoire unique to the
Kinetoplastida and so entirely new.
Having identified those features of trypanosomatid
genomes that reflect their free-living ancestry, a B. saltans
genome sequence would also reveal the additions to each
parasite genome; structures derived from existing genes

and co-opted for novel uses, and genuinely novel genes
involved in parasite-specific adaptations. These enigmatic
genes include the numerous and diverse families of surface glycoprotein that form the protective coats around
trypanosomatid parasites. T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major
each display highly derived and complex surface coats to
frustrate host immunity, yet they differ in structure and
substance and it is not known how each acquired its distinct solution to their common problem. Understanding
the origins of these surface architectures will only be
achieved with an historical perspective; one principal
objective of a B. saltans genome project would be to identify the precursors of proteins such as VSG in T. brucei,
mucins and trans-sialidase in T. cruzi, and proteophosphoglycans in Leishmania spp. (amongst others). A

glimpse of this potential is seen in Figure 3, which
includes a predicted protein with a complex 24 amino
acid repeat (13440â16655 bp). The protein had a high
affinity (42% amino acids identical) with a gene family on
chromosome 12 in Leishmania spp., (currently annotated
as 'surface antigens'), and a more distant affinity with proteophosphoglycans. Figure 3b shows a sequence alignment of the repeat domain from the B. saltans protein and
its leishmanial homologs, where the level of amino acid
identity rises to 50%.

Conclusion
Thorough sequencing of a few locations in the B. saltans
genome has revealed clear similarities with trypanosomatids, but has also shown that trypanosomatid genome

Methods
Fosmid library preparation
A freshwater strain of Bodo saltans ('Lake Konstanz'; courtesy of Dr Julius Lukes, University of South Bohemia,
Czech Republic), was cultured in tap water in the presence
of environmental bacteria. Bodonid cells were concentrated through a gentle centrifugation step (3,000 g for 2
minutes). Genomic DNA was prepared after resuspension
of the pellet using phenol-chloroform extraction. This
preparation contained a residuum of bacterial DNA.
Genomic DNA was sheared and blunt-end repaired before
being electrophoresed on a CHEF gel, from which the 25â
40 kb band region was excised. The DNA was electroluted
from the gel slice and ligated into a pCC1 fosmid vector
(CopyControl Fosmid Kit; Epicentre Biotechnologies).
Fosmid ligations were packaged into lambda bacteriophage (Gigapack XL2 Packaging Extract; Stratagene) and
used to transform XL2-Blue MRF ultracompetent cells.
Positive transformants were picked from chloramphenicol plates and cultured under drug selection. The B. saltans
genome library contained 9600 individual clones
(approximately 300 Mb).
Clone selection and sequencing
As B. saltans cannot be grown axenically, 96 fosmid inserts
were end-sequenced to examine the relative contributions
of bodonid and bacterial DNA to the library. 16% of
clones had end-sequences with affinity for eukaryotic coding sequences when compared to databases. Another 19%
of clones had matches to bacterial sequences. Hence,
although a larger proportion of end-sequences may have
been genuine bodonid non-coding sequences (without
representation in sequence databases), the library
included a considerable, perhaps equal, component of
bacterial DNA. Seven clones with positive end-sequence
matches to trypanosomatid genes were sequenced in full
(see below). Filters were prepared for the library by spotting bacterial culture on to a charged nylon membrane
(Nytran Supercharge membrane: Schleicher and Schuell
Bioscience) and lysing the cells; denaturation and fixation
of the fosmid DNA produced a filter representing 8,832
genome fragments of 25â40 Kb. The filter was probed for
five known B. saltans genes using radiolabelled PCR products, generated with the following primers: Î±-tubulin (F:
AACGCSTGCTGGGAGYTGT; R: GTTGATRCCGCACTTGAAGCC; 1 kb), Î²-tubulin (F: AACCAGATCGGCTCNAAGTT; R: GATGTTGTTSGGGATCCACTC; 1 kb),
Glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (F: CGGTCAAGGTAGGCATCAAC; R: TTGGGAAGGTTGTTCTGGAG; 800 bp), Heat shock protein 70 (F:
TTCAAGAACGACCAGGTTGA;
R:
ACCAAGTCCGGCAACAATAG; 1.4 kb) and Rab1 (F: TTTGACAACCGBTACAAGGC; R: CCTTTGCGGACGTCTCAAAGTA; 500 bp).
Clones corresponding to positive spots on the filter were
cultured, and purified fosmid DNA was fully sequenced

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/594

using a shotgun sequencing method to approximately 8Ã
coverage.
Assembly and analysis
Fosmid inserts were assembled using Phrap [39] and
arranged within Gap4 [40]. PCR products were generated
to close residual gaps between finished contigs. Finished
sequence was annotated within Artemis [41,42] and coding sequences were initially defined by eye. Whole
sequences were compared to EMBL sequence databases
using both BLASTn and BLASTp algorithms. Coding
sequences were scrutinised for possible transmembrane
helices and signal peptides using TMHMM [43] and SignalP [44] respectively. Each coding sequence was checked
for known protein domains using all options within the
Interproscan suite [45]. Conserved synteny was assessed
by aligning B. saltans contigs with T. brucei and L. major
chromosomal regions using ACT [46] and existing
trypanosomatid sequences downloaded from the
GeneDB website [7].
