Abstract
Background: L-arabitol dehydrogenase (LAD) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) are involved in
the degradation of L-arabinose and D-xylose, which are among the most abundant
monosaccharides on earth. Previous data demonstrated that LAD and XDH not only differ in the
activity on their biological substrate, but also that only XDH has significant activity on D-sorbitol
and may therefore be more closely related to D-sorbitol dehydrogenases (SDH). In this study we
aimed to identify residues involved in the difference in substrate specificity.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that LAD, XDH and SDH form 3 distinct groups of
the family of dehydrogenases containing an Alcohol dehydrogenase GroES-like domain
(pfam08240) and likely have evolved from a common ancestor. Modelling of LadA and XdhA of the
saprobic fungus Aspergillus niger on human SDH identified two residues in LadA (M70 and Y318),
that may explain the absence of activity on D-sorbitol. While introduction of the mutation M70F
in LadA of A. niger resulted in a nearly complete enzyme inactivation, the Y318F resulted in
increased activity for L-arabitol and xylitol. Moreover, the affinity for D-sorbitol was increased in
this mutant.
Conclusion: These data demonstrates that Y318 of LadA contributes significantly to the substrate
specificity difference between LAD and XDH/SDH.

Background
L-arabinose and D-xylose are two of the most abundant
monosaccharides in nature. They are components of the
plant cell wall polysaccharides xylan, xyloglucan and pec-

tin [1] and therefore an important carbon source for
microorganisms growing on plants or plant matter. In
fungi, L-arabinose and D-xylose are catabolised through
the pentose catabolic pathway [2]. L-arabinose is con-

verted to xylitol in 3 steps by the enzymes L-arabinose
reductase, L-arabitol dehydrogenase and L-xylulose
reductase, while D-xylose reductase converts D-xylose in a
single step to xylitol. Xylitol is then converted to D-xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase, which is subsequently
phosphorylated to D-xylulose-5-phosphate that enters the
pentose phosphate pathway.
The pentose catabolic pathway has been studied mainly in
Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans and Trichoderma reesei
(Hypocrea jecorina) and, except for L-arabinose reductase
and L-xylulose reductase, all genes from the pathway have
been identified and characterised [2-11]. In vitro analysis
of the substrate specificity of A. niger L-arabitol dehydrogenase and xylitol dehydrogenase demonstrated that Larabitol dehydrogenase is active on L-arabitol and xylitol,
but not on D-sorbitol, while xylitol dehydrogenase is
active on xylitol and D-sorbitol, but not on L-arabitol [5].
In this study we aimed to elucidate the structural basis for
the differences in substrate specificity particularly concerning the activity on D-sorbitol.

Results

strapped NJ tree (1000 bootstraps, Fig. 1) of the alignment
shows that the D-sorbitol dehydrogenases of animals and
plants split into two groups reflecting the kingdoms. The
fungal L-arabitol and xylitol dehydrogenases form separate groups in the tree. In addition, a group with unknown
function that contains the additional A. niger gene found
in the KEGG database splits of from the xylitol dehydrogenase branch, although this clade only has a low bootstrap support (50%). The ladB and ladC groups split of
from the ladA branch forming clearly defined groups.
With respect to substrate specificity SDH and XDH are
more similar to each other than either is to LAD
Previously it was reported for A. niger that LadA is active
on L-arabitol and xylitol, but not on D-sorbitol, while
XdhA is active on xylitol and D-sorbitol, but not on L-arabitol.

To determine whether D-sorbitol dehydrogenase is able to
hydrolyse xylitol and L-arabitol we determined the activity of sheep liver D-sorbitol dehydrogenase on these substrates (Table 1) demonstrating that SDH has similar
activity on D-sorbitol and xylitol, but significantly lower
on L-arabitol.

Fungal xylitol and L-arabitol dehydrogenases form
separate groups from D-sorbitol dehydrogenases of higher
eukaryotes in the family of dehydrogenases containing a
Alcohol dehydrogenase GroES-like domain (pfam08240)
To determine whether fungal genomes contain homologues of D-sorbitol dehydrogenases of higher eukaryotes,
the human D-sorbitol dehydrogenase [12] amino acid
sequence was blasted against the genomes of A. niger, A.
nidulans and A. oryzae at the comparative Aspergillus
server
from
the
Broad
Institute
http://
www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/
aspergillus_group/MultiHome.html. However, the highest hit for these fungi was xylitol dehydrogenase (data not
shown). In addition, the KEGG website http://
www.genome.ad.jp/dbget-bin/
www_bget?enzyme+1.1.1.15 was searched for putative Dsorbitol dehydrogenases of A. niger. Two of these corresponded to ladA and xdhA, while a third was An09g03900.
In addition, two homologues of A. nidulans ladA, ladB and
ladC, have been described [7] although no biochemical
function has been reported for these proteins. Putative
orthologues for ladB were only found in A. niger and A.
oryzae, while orthologues for ladC were only absent in N.
crassa and T. reeseii out of the 8 fungi tested in this study.

Modelling of the 3-dimensional structure of LadA and
XdhA
Structural models of A. niger LadA and XdhA were generated using the structure of human D-sorbitol dehydrogenase [12]. The position of conserved amino acids was
analysed in the models. A large group of amino acids
(some of which are in close proximity of the substrate) are
conserved in D-sorbitol, L-arabitol and xylitol dehydrogenases (Fig. 2, in blue). In addition, both L-arabitol and
xylitol dehydrogenases contain amino acids that are conserved in their own subgroup but that are different in the
other dehydrogenases (Fig 2, in red). These residues are
located throughout the structure. The structures have also
been analysed for the location of amino acids that are
conserved between L-arabitol and D-sorbitol dehydrogenases, but different in xylitol dehydrogenases (Fig 2A, in
yellow). None of these amino acids are located close to
the substrate. In contrast, of the amino acids that are conserved between xylitol and D-sorbitol dehydrogenases,
but that are different in L-arabitol dehydrogenases, two
(M70 and Y318, numbers from LadA sequence of A. niger)
are located close to the substrate (Fig 2B, in yellow).

To determine the phylogenetic relationships between Larabitol dehydrogenases, xylitol dehydrogenases and Dsorbitol dehydrogenases, an alignment was performed
using amino acid sequences of established and putative Larabitol and xylitol dehydrogenases of eight fungi, Dsorbitol dehydrogenases of ten eukaryotes and the other
genes found in the analysis described above. A boot-

Analysis of LadA M70F and Y318F
Using site directed mutagenesis, specific mutants of LadA
were produced in which M70 and Y318 were altered, individually and in combination, to phenylalanine that is
present at these positions in xylitol and D-sorbitol dehydrogenases. The mutant and the wild type enzymes were
expressed in E. coli and purified. Comparison of the

kinetic properties of wild type LadA and the Y318F
mutant protein demonstrated that the Y318F mutant protein had a higher Vmax on L-arabitol and xylitol, but similar affinity (Km) (Table 2). In contrast, the Vmax on Dsorbitol was similar for LadA and the Y318F mutant protein, but the Km of the mutant was nearly 5-times lower
(Table 2).

Discussion
Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of
LadA and XdhA to other L-arabitol, xylitol and D-sorbitol
dehydrogenases, as well as some putative dehydrogenases
with unknown function demonstrated that these enzymes
form distinct groups in the family of dehydrogenases containing an Alcohol dehydrogenase GroES-like domain
(pfam08240). Previously it was suggested that L-arabitol
dehydrogenase might be the fungal orthologue of D-sorbitol dehydrogenase of higher eukaryotes [7]. However, the
data in our study indicates that LAD, XDH and SDH are
three distinct families, possibly originating from a common ancestor. Based on sequence identity (data not
shown) and enzyme activity XDH appears to be more similar to SDH than LAD, as XDH but not LAD was shown to
have significant activity on D-sorbitol [5], while SDH is
significantly more active on xylitol than on L-arabitol (our
study).

Interestingly, our study suggests that there is no clear fungal orthologue of SDH, based on BLAST and KEGG analysis. As the expression of A. niger ladA and xdhA appears
highly specific for L-arabinose and D-xylose [5], it is
unlikely that these enzymes are also acting as a sorbitol
dehydrogenase for this fungus. A possible candidate sorbitol dehydrogenase might be the enzyme encoded by the
uncharacterised gene from A. niger (An09g03900) that is
in the groups that splits of the XDH branch in the tree. As
orthologues for this gene were found in all tested fungi, it
appears to encode a conserved function. However, bootstrap support for similarity of these enzymes to SDH is
weak, indicating that no reliable prediction of function is
possible based on these results.

The M70F mutation of LadA of A. niger resulted in almost
complete inactivation of the enzyme on a variety of substrates. The reason for this is not clear at this point, but a
possible explanation could be that M70 in this particular
enzyme influences the 3-dimensional structure; thus promoting enzyme activity. As the aim of this study was to
identify residues important in substrate specificity, we did
not further investigate this mutation.
The Y318F mutation of LadA resulted in increased affinity
of the enzyme for D-sorbitol, while the Vmax and Kcat
increased for L-arabitol and xylitol. Projection of the catalytic site of LAD, SDH and XDH predicts that the tyrosine
residue in LAD and the phenylalanine in SDH and XDH
are in exactly the same position (Fig. 3). This suggests that
the OH group on the Y318 is the only structural difference
between LadA and the Y318F mutant protein. This demonstrates that the presence of a phenylalanine at this posi-

The two homologues of LadA described for A. nidulans [7]
cluster in the tree with LadA, but appear as separate
branches. LadB appears to only be present in the
Aspergilli, while LadC is present in most of the tested
fungi. A previous study suggested the presence of a single
L-arabitol dehydrogenase encoding gene involved in the
L-arabinose catabolism [6], as a UV mutant of this gene
was devoid of L-arabitol dehydrogenase activity. It is
therefore likely that LadB and LadC have different biological functions f LadA.
Modelling of the structure from A. niger LadA and XdhA
on human D-sorbitol dehydrogenase revealed a large
number of amino acids that are conserved in all three
types of dehydrogenases, including the residues involved
in Zinc binding (H80, E81 and E166, numbers from LadA
sequence) [13]. None of the residues that were conserved
in L-arabitol and D-sorbitol dehydrogenases, but different
in xylitol dehydrogenases were in close proximity of the
substrate cleft. However, two of the residues (F62 and
F302 from XdhA) that were conserved in xylitol and Dsorbitol dehydrogenases, but different in L-arabitol dehydrogenases (corresponding to M70 and Y318 from LadA)
were located very close to the substrate, suggesting that
they may be important for substrate specificity. As both
XdhA and D-sorbitol dehydrogenase are active on D-sorbitol, whereas LadA has very little activity on this substrate
[5] this could indicate that these residues are important
for activity on D-sorbitol.

tion contributes significantly to D-sorbitol dehydrogenase
activity. This OH-group probably affects positioning of Dsorbitol by hydrogen-bond formation in the substrate
binding site, which prevents efficient catalysis in native A.
niger LadA. The tyrosine residue does not affect affinity of
LadA for L-arabitol and xylitol. However, the increased
activity in the mutant suggests that the presence of the
OH-group delays release of the products (L-xylulose and
D-xylulose). D-sorbitol and xylitol differ structurally from
L-arabitol with respect to positioning of the OH-group on
C2 and C4, while D-sorbitol has an additional OH group
at C5 compared to xylitol (Fig. 4). The increased affinity
for D-sorbitol but not for L-arabitol or xylitol of the Y318F
mutant may suggest that the presence of the OH group on
Y318 in LadA interferes with the OH group on C5 of L-arabitol, resulting in a conformation for D-sorbitol in the
active site that inhibits enzymatic conversion.
Genomes are continuously subjected to sequence mutations, resulting in evolution of species and biodiversity.
Mutations that result in beneficial changes are likely to be
maintained, while disadvantageous mutations will lose

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/166

out in natural selection and therefore disappear again. The
higher activity on L-arabitol of the Y318F mutant protein
suggests an evolutionary advantage for this mutation with
respect to conversion of this compound and therefore the
efficiency of this metabolic pathway. This could indicate
that this step in the pathway is not rate-limiting and therefore increased activity does not result in a biological
advantage. Alternatively, since the increased activity is
accompanied by a reduction in specificity this could provide selection against this mutation. It may be disadvantageous to convert other substrates simultaneously with Larabitol, either due to competition for the enzyme or
because the resulting product have a negative effect on
growth.

Conclusion
In conclusion we have shown that xylitol dehydrogenases
are more closely related to D-sorbitol dehydrogenases
than L-arabitol dehydrogenases. Moreover, we proved
that the Y318F mutation is important for activity on Dsorbitol of L-arabitol dehydrogenase. These data increase
our understanding of the molecular basis of substrate specificity of these closely related enzyme classes.

Methods
Strains and plasmids
Escherichia coli DH5αF' and M15 [pREP4] were used for
routine plasmid propagation and for enzyme production,
respectively. Cloning was performed using pBluescript
SK+ [14], pGEM-T easy (Promega) and pQE32 (Qiagen).
Molecular biology methods
Standard methods were used for DNA manipulations,
such as cloning, DNA digestion, and plasmid DNA isolation [15]. Sequence analysis was performed using the Big
Dye Terminator kit, Version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the supplier's instructions. The
reactions were analysed with an ABI 310 (Applied Biosystems) or on an ABI 377 (Applied Biosystems) in which
case Longranger Single Packs (Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, Inc., Rockland, ME) were used.
Sequence analysis
Nucleotide sequences were analysed with computer programs based on those of Devereux et al. [16]. Sequence
alignments were performed by using the Blast programs
[17] at the server of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information,
Bethesda,
Md.,
USA
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. Multiple sequence alignments and construction of the bootstrap tree were performed using ClustalX2.0 [18]

to E. coli M13 cells (Qiagen). Transformation and purification of the recombinant proteins using Ni-agarose (Qiagen) was performed according to the supplier's
instructions.
Enzyme assays
All enzyme assays were performed at 20°C. Dehydrogenase activities were determined using 100 mM glycine pH
9.6, 0.4 mM NAD+ and 100 mM substrate. Reductase
activities were determined using 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6, 0.2 mM NADH and 100 mM substrate.
Absorbance changes at 340 nm (ε = 6.22 mM-1 cm-1) were
measured on a Unicam UV-1 spectrophotometer (Spectronic Unicam, Rochester, NY). Sheep liver SDH was
obtained from Sigma (S3764).
Modelling
Models of A. niger LadA and XdhA structures were generated using the SWISS-MODEL program http://swiss
model.expasy.org//SWISS-MODEL.html[19-21] with a
crystal structure of D-sorbitol dehydrogenase (Protein
Data Bank code: 1PL6). In this structure human D-sorbitol dehydrogenase is in complex with the cofactor NAD
and an inhibitor [12]. The models were represented using
the software package PYMOL [22].
Site-directed mutagenesis
Site directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quik
Change protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Two complementary oligonucleotides of 30–34 nucleotides were
designed for each mutation, carrying the mutation in the
middle of the oligonucleotide. PCR mixtures contained
50 ng of DNA template, 125 ng of each oligonucleotide, 1
μl of a 10 mM dNTP stock, 5 μl of 10× pfu buffer, and sterile water to a total volume of 24 μl. Before the start of the
PCR, 1 μl of pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was added.
The reaction parameters were: denaturation of the DNA
for 5 min at 95°C, followed by 16 cycles of 30 s denaturation (95°C), 1 min annealing (56°C) and 15 min amplification (68°C). The product was incubated for 4 h with
DpnI at 37°C. This enzyme degrades methylated (template) DNA but not the DNA amplified during the PCR.
