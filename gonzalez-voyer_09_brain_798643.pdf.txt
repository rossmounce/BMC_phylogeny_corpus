Abstract
Background: The vertebrate brain is composed of several interconnected, functionally distinct
structures and much debate has surrounded the basic question of how these structures evolve. On
the one hand, according to the 'mosaic evolution hypothesis', because of the elevated metabolic
cost of brain tissue, selection is expected to target specific structures mediating the cognitive
abilities which are being favored. On the other hand, the 'concerted evolution hypothesis' argues
that developmental constraints limit such mosaic evolution and instead the size of the entire brain
varies in response to selection on any of its constituent parts. To date, analyses of these hypotheses
of brain evolution have been limited to mammals and birds; excluding Actinopterygii, the basal and
most diverse class of vertebrates. Using a combination of recently developed phylogenetic
multivariate allometry analyses and comparative methods that can identify distinct rates of
evolution, even in highly correlated traits, we studied brain structure evolution in a highly variable
clade of ray-finned fishes; the Tanganyikan cichlids.
Results: Total brain size explained 86% of the variance in brain structure volume in cichlids, a
lower proportion than what has previously been reported for mammals. Brain structures showed
variation in pair-wise allometry suggesting some degree of independence in evolutionary changes
in size. This result is supported by variation among structures on the strength of their loadings on
the principal size axis of the allometric analysis. The rate of evolution analyses generally supported
the results of the multivariate allometry analyses, showing variation among several structures in
their evolutionary patterns. The olfactory bulbs and hypothalamus were found to evolve faster than
other structures while the dorsal medulla presented the slowest evolutionary rate.
Conclusion: Our results favor a mosaic model of brain evolution, as certain structures are
evolving in a modular fashion, with a small but non-negligible influence of concerted evolution in
cichlid fishes. Interestingly, one of the structures presenting distinct evolutionary patterns within
cichlids, the olfactory bulbs, has also been shown to evolve differently from other structures in
mammals. Hence, our results for a basal vertebrate clade also point towards a conserved
developmental plan for all vertebrates.

Background
The vertebrate brain is divided into several functionally
distinct, albeit interconnected, structures [1-3]. Although
specific roles cannot be exclusively attributed to particular
structures there is a general consensus that different types
of cognitive information are indeed mostly processed
within certain brain structures [2,4], and that increased
demand on cognitive abilities tends to be associated with
an increase in size of the structure processing the information [5-8]. Thus, because of the high metabolic costs of
brain tissue [9,10] selection may be expected to target
enlargement of only specific structures associated with the
behavior or cognitive ability being favored, resulting in
brains evolving in a mosaic fashion where changes in the
size of specific structures are independent of changes in
other structures [1,11,12]. However, it has been suggested
that developmental constraints may limit the degree to
which structures can evolve independently and that part
or whole size dissociations may be inherently less feasible
responses to selection than concerted evolution of all
structures [13,14]. Under such a concerted evolution
model, larger brains would basically be 'scaled-up' versions of smaller brains with conserved relative proportions of their constituent parts, and thus the size of the
whole brain is predicted to vary in response to selection
on any of its constituent parts [12-14]. Interestingly, initial support for either hypothesis is derived from independent analyses of essentially the same data: brain and
structure sizes from four clades of mammals (insectivores,
prosimians, simians and bats) [1,13,14]. A subsequent
study incremented the coverage of the mammalian database adding 29 more species from 5 orders to the original
dataset, and its results appear to support a predominant
role for concerted evolution [15]. The only study to have
looked beyond mammals supports a predominant role
for mosaic evolution of brain structures in birds [12].
The two hypotheses are not presented as alternative or
mutually exclusive explanations of brain evolution, and
the debate, even among their proponents, has mostly centered on the relative importance of developmental constraints versus adaptive flexibility [1,2,14]. Indeed, not all
interspecific variation in structure size within the mammalian brain can be explained purely by developmental
constraints as some structures, such as the olfactory bulbs
and the limbic system (the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the amygdala), do not fit such a model and in
these cases mosaic evolution may play a more important
role [13,14]. On the other hand, brain evolution is
unlikely to be purely mosaic as functionally linked brain
structures in both primates and birds do show signals of
evolving in a correlated fashion. Moreover, patterns of
correlated evolution among structures can be predicted
from the degree of anatomical connectivity [3,12]. So,
why all the fuss? The influence of developmental con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/238

straints relative to flexible evolution of particular structures in response to selection is of foremost importance
when investigating the selective pressures which may have
influenced observed differences, and as such, to our
understanding of brain evolution. In order to identify the
units within the brain upon which selection can act it is
first necessary to understand the mechanisms behind
brain evolution. For example, is larger neocortex size in
simians the result of selection pressures for cortically
based functions or is it the result of selection acting on a
whole other level, for example on non-cortical functions
such as motor control via the basal ganglia [14], which
resulted in increased brain size and, because of developmental constraints, an enlarged neocortex? In other
words, are advanced cognitive traits of modern humans
fortuitous by-products afforded by the "spandrel" of
greater neocortical capacity [14]?
As mentioned earlier, the relative importance of concerted
and mosaic models has mostly been analyzed in mammals [1,11,13-15] with the notable exception of one study
on birds [12]. Whether brain structure evolution in the
basal, and most diverse vertebrate clade, the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes), follows a concerted or mosaic
model has yet to be studied even though indirect evidence
suggests a role for both mechanisms. For instance, a previous study of a monophyletic clade of Tanganyikan cichlids found that whole brain size correlated significantly
with structure volume and that there was variation among
structures in the percentage of their variance explained by
brain size (32 - 76%) [16]. However, the study was limited
to a single clade, included only 7 species and, when analyzing correlations between brain size and structure volume, did not control for phylogenetic effects. Functional
comparisons of pallial structures within the vertebrate
forebrain suggest that two separate memory systems, a
hippocampus based spatial, relational or temporal memory system, and an amygdala based emotional memory
system appeared early during evolution [17]. Therefore,
the forebrain of vertebrates could share a common, conserved pattern of organization [17]; and hence, there
could be conserved developmental patterns spanning
across all vertebrate clades. Examples of variation in structure size favoring mosaic evolution can be seen by comparing the medullary lobes of goldfish (Carassius sp) and
catfish (Clarias sp), or the extreme example of the massively enlarged valvula cerebelli and electrosensory lateral
line lobe of mormyrids [2]. It has also been suggested that
mosaic evolution could be playing a more important role
in the evolution of at least certain brain structures of the
Actinopterygii [2].
Here we analyzed the relative influence of the mosaic and
concerted models of brain structure evolution in the Tanganyikan cichlids, a highly variable clade of ray-finned

fishes and the epitome of adaptive radiation [18]. Tanganyikan cichlids are an excellent model for the analysis of
rates of phenotypic evolution as they are the most diverse
phenotypically, morphologically and behaviorally of the
African cichlids and recent morphological analyses have
demonstrated the adaptive nature of their radiation
[19,20]. Previous analyses have shown that brain size and
structure are associated with ecology and behavior [16,2123], suggesting that, as with other morphological traits,
brain size and structure are also highly variable within
Tanganyikan cichlids. We combined phylogenetic multivariate allometry analyses [24,25] with recently developed
comparative methods that allow for detailed description
of rates of phenotypic evolution, even between highly correlated traits, [26,27] to compare evolutionary patterns
among major brain structures.

Results
Multivariate allometry analyses
The first component (PC1) in the multivariate principal
component analysis explained 86% of the total variance
in structure volume, the second component (PC2)
explained 7% of the variance, or about 50% of the variance not explained by brain size. Finally, although the
third component (PC3) only explained about 5% of the
total variance, it still contributes to 36% of the variance
not explained by changes in brain size, and it is more than
four times the fourth component. Two lines of evidence
strongly suggest PC1 describes variance in structure volume resulting from differences in brain size. Firstly, all
structures increased in size with increasing values of PC1.
Secondly, even when controlling for phylogenetic effects,
species scores for PC1 were significantly correlated with
brain weight (t = -2.92, p = 0.006). Thus, overall changes
in brain size explain about 86% of the variance in structure volume. The second and third principal components
appear to be related mainly with the size of the dorsal
medulla and olfactory bulbs. The dorsal medulla showed
a strong positive loading (0.72; Table 1) and the olfactory
bulbs a weaker positive loading (0.35; Table 1) on PC2,
while all other structures loaded negatively, although the
optic tecta, cerebellum and hypothalamus with relatively
low loadings (Table 1). These results suggest PC2 mainly
describes variation in dorsal medulla volume, which is
supported by the fact that the dorsal medulla is the only
structure to correlate significantly with PC2 when controlling for phylogeny (t = 3.28, p = 0.002). PC3 appears to
separate species based on the size of the olfactory bulbs
and dorsal medulla, which interestingly show contrasting
patterns: while the olfactory bulbs show a strong positive
loading (0.85), the dorsal medulla shows a relatively
strong negative loading (-0.51; Table 1) and all other
structures show weak negative loadings. Thus, it appears
PC2 and PC3 could be associated with sensory specialization, distinguishing between species relying more on gus-

tatory cues and possibly also olfaction from those relying
more on visual information.
Brain structures showed variation in pairwise allometric
relationships suggesting relative independence among
structures in evolutionary changes in size, even when controlling for phylogenetic effects. The olfactory bulbs presented bivariate allometric coefficients > 1 when
compared with all structures, although with some structures the relationship was nearly isometric. On the other
hand, the cerebellum presented hypoallometry with all
other structures (Table 2). The dorsal medulla also presented hypoallometry with all other structures except for
the cerebellum (Table 2). In sum, the allometric coefficients suggest that certain structures, such as the olfactory
bulbs, present larger changes in size with changes in other
structures, while others, for example the dorsal medulla
and cerebellum, change less in size with changes in other
structures. These interpretations of the results are supported by the loadings of the individual structures on
PC1, the size axis (Table 3). The olfactory bulbs and the
dorsal medulla have the lowest loadings of all structures,
suggesting a weaker correlation between the volume of
these structures and whole brain size.
Rate of evolution analyses
Brain size
The rate of evolution of whole brain size did not show a
significant departure from the basic Brownian model. The
diversity through time plot and the low MDI (0.12) value
(Fig 1a), which was lower than that of any brain structure
except for the dorsal medulla, both suggest no departure
from Brownian evolution of brain size. The result of the
morphological disparity analysis is supported by the value
of λ, which did not differ significantly from unity suggesting that the evolution of brain weight followed Brownian

motion (Table 4). The maximum likelihood value of α
did show significant departure from Brownian motion
(Table 4). However, although this result contrasts with the
MDI value and estimate of λ, the value of alpha is much
lower than the estimate for both the olfactory bulbs and
the hypothalamus and is closer to the values for the telencephalon, and cerebellum, which did not depart from a
Brownian model of evolution. Hence, these results suggest that total brain size evolves in a gradual manner [28].
Brain structures
There were notable differences in the rates of evolution of
the different brain structures. Both the olfactory bulbs and
the hypothalamus presented the highest MDI values of all
structures (0.27 and 0.24, respectively), both were 1.25
and 1.18 times larger than the MDI for brain size strongly
suggesting that these structures present higher rates of
morphological divergence than brain size (Fig 1). The
dorsal medulla presented by far the lowest MDI value
(0.01) suggesting very gradual rates of divergence. Finally,
the telencephalon, optic tecta and cerebellum presented
similar MDI values (0.17 and 0.15, and 0.19, respectively)
and similar disparity through time plots (Fig 1c, d, e). A
pattern worth highlighting is the apparent recent diver-

gence in volume of the olfactory bulbs, as can be seen in
the diversity through time plot (Fig 1b). The solid black
line, showing morphological divergence in volume of the
olfactory bulbs, diverges from the broken line, showing
the pattern under Brownian motion, at about 6 MYA and
a sharp peak between 4 - 2 MYA. In a similar fashion,
although the pattern is less striking, the disparity through
time plot for the dorsal medulla (Fig 1f) also suggests that
the present interspecific variation in the volume of this
structure results from recent evolutionary divergence as
shown by the increase in relative disparity observed
between 4 and 1 MYA.
The results of the morphological divergence analyses were
well supported by the results of the maximum likelihood
estimates of λ and α. The only two structures which
showed significant departure from Brownian motion were
the olfactory bulbs and the hypothalamus (Table 3). Both
structures showed clear signals of more rapid rates of evolution than any of the other structures, as was the case
when compared with brain size. None of the remaining
structures showed any significant departure from Brownian motion (Table 3).

Loadings of the individual structures on the first principal component

indicate to what extent variance in brain size explains variance in
structure volume.

Overall, our approach based on phylogenetic allometry
and rate of phenotypic evolution analyses suggests that
brain evolution in Tanganyikan cichlids mainly follows a
mosaic model. However, as is the case in both birds and
mammals, brain evolution in Tanganyikan cichlids is not
purely mosaic and our results also suggest a non-negligible role for concerted evolution [1,3,12]. The results of the
phylogenetic multivariate allometry analyses suggest that
in Tanganyikan cichlids the variance in brain structure
volume explained solely by changes in brain size is much
lower than for mammals. While in cichlids differences in
brain size accounted for 86% of the variance in structure
volume, even when accounting for non-independence of
data due to species relatedness, in mammals brain size differences account for 96% of the variance, although in
mammals the analysis did not account for phylogenetic
effects [13]. This could in part be due to larger size differences in the mammalian sample (range of body weights =
1.86 - 105 000 g) compared to our sample (range of body

weights = 0.52 - 135 g), although if brain evolution was
strongly influenced by developmental constraints the size
range of species included in the sample would not be
expected to influence the proportion of variance
explained. Therefore, our results suggest that in cichlids
brain structures evolve in a more independent fashion
from changes in whole brain size as compared with mammals. Further, a previous study has shown that although
brain and body size in Tanganyikan cichlids were highly
correlated, even when controlling for phylogenetic effects,
brain size shows a markedly different pattern of evolution
from that of body size [28]. Hence, even highly correlated
traits can show distinct patterns of evolution and the
results of this study indicate that, at least in cichlids, variance in brain structure volumes is not only explained by
the single factor of overall brain size (see Fig 2 for an
example of variation in structure volumes across species).
The bivariate allometric coefficients suggest there is relative variation in the allometric relationships between
structures, although some structure pairs are nearly isometric. The olfactory bulbs were the most variable brain
structure in comparison with all the others, as shown by
the fact that this structure showed positive bivariate
allometry with all the others and it had the lowest loading
on PC1, the size axis, suggesting that its volume is less correlated with whole brain size as compared with other
structures. The dorsal medulla, on the other hand, appears
to be the least variable of all structures as it presented
bivariate coefficients < 1 when compared with all other
structures, except for the cerebellum, and presented the
second smallest correlation with whole brain size. The
results of the allometry analyses are generally supported

by the results of the rates of evolution analyses. Only two
structures showed consistent and significant departure
from a gradual, Brownian motion model of evolution, the
first being the olfactory bulbs and the second the hypothalamus (Table 4). Both structures also present evolutionary patterns which contrast with those of the whole brain
as with those of other structures, again suggesting that
they vary more in size among species than any other structure. The hypothalamus showed varying allometry with
other brain structures, ranging from hyperallometry with
the cerebellum to slight hypoallometry with the olfactory
bulbs. Interestingly, the hypothalamus had the strongest
loading on PC1, suggesting its volume is highly correlated
with total brain size. Thus, it appears that although the
volume of this structure is highly correlated with total
brain size, volumetric changes occur more rapidly than in
total brain size, as suggested by the high alpha value
(Table 4). The dorsal medulla presented the lowest MDI
value of all structures, even smaller than MDI for brain
size, and it presented the highest λ and smallest α of all
structures, suggesting more gradual evolution than other
brain structures. The results of the rate of evolution analyses further suggest there has been a recent, rapid divergence in the volume of the olfactory bulbs and
hypothalamus among Tanganyikan cichlids. Such rapid
divergence is especially notable in the diversity through
time plot of the olfactory bulbs (Fig 1b), which presents a
recent, high peak in morphological divergence suggesting
that interspecific differences in olfactory bulb volume are
the result of a recent evolutionary divergence. Although
the height of the peak may in part be due to incomplete
sampling, which possibly results in overestimation of
between species differences [28,29], it is unlikely that the

pattern is due solely to incomplete sampling as it is
observed only for the olfactory bulbs and not for other
structures. Interestingly, the diversity through time plot of
the dorsal medulla also suggests that most phenotypic
divergence results from recent evolutionary events, even if
the pattern is not as striking as for the olfactory bulbs.
Such recent divergence suggests potential independent
invasion of new niche space, which placed a premium on
olfaction, and possibly also taste and other chemosensory
abilities, by different lineages during the Tanganyikan
radiation. As a whole, these results are in line with what
would be predicted under a model of mosaic evolution of
brain structure [1,12], since there are clear signals of independent evolution for at least for two of the six brain
structures analyzed here. It is worth highlighting that in
mammals the olfactory bulb also appears to be the most
variable brain structure and it has even been suggested as
an exception to the concerted evolution model [13,14].
Furthermore, as would also be predicted under a mosaic
model of evolution, our results suggest that specific structures can be the target of selection, rather than all structures changing in size simultaneously, since the second
and third principal components appear to separate species
based on sensory specialization. The second component
mainly describes variation in dorsal medulla size, as
shown by the high loading of this structure and by the fact
that it is the only structure that correlates significantly
with PC2 scores. The third component mainly describes
variation in dorsal medulla and olfactory bulb size, and

here there appears to be a trade-off between the volume of
these structures since the olfactory bulb loads positively
and the dorsal medulla negatively on PC3. However, this
apparent trade-off must be taken with caution as PC3
describes variation in dorsal medulla size not already
accounted for by PC2. In sum, there appears to be a distinction between species relying more on olfaction and
chemosensory or taste information on the one hand and
species relying more on visual cues on the other, as shown
by the fact that while the dorsal medulla and olfactory
bulbs load positively on PC2 all other structures show
negative loadings. This apparent trade-off between structure sizes could be explained by cognitive demands associated with habitat and diet specialization, both of which
have been previously shown to be associated with brain
size and structure in Tanganyikan cichlids [16,21-23].
Indeed, the size of the cerebellum is positively correlated
with habitat complexity, and the telencephalon showed a
similar trend, while olfactory bulb and dorsal medulla
sizes are negatively correlated with habitat complexity in
a monophyletic clade of Tanganyikan cichlids [16]. In
another study analyzing brain structure in cichlids from
all three African Great Lakes, areas associated with vision
and taste were shown to be associated with differences in
feeding habits [22]. Piscivorous taxa, and others feeding
on motile prey, had larger optic tecta and cerebellum
compared to species feeding on mollusks or plants, while
structures relating to taste were well developed in species
feeding on benthos over muddy or sandy substrates [22],
although the lack of detailed phylogenies at the time pre-

cluded any control for phylogenetic effects. Hence, our
results are in line with previous findings suggesting adaptive, independent variation in brain structure size in
response to specific selection pressures [1,11,12].
Although the variance in structure volume explained by
changes in whole brain size is much lower than in mammals, it still represents 86% of all variance in volume.
Hence, although brain structure evolution appears to be
more flexible in the Tanganyikan cichlids than in mammals, there is still a high proportion of the variance in volume that is explained solely by changes in size [13,14].
Furthermore, except for the olfactory bulbs and the
hypothalamus, none of the structures showed evolutionary patterns which differed significantly from those of
whole brain size. Further, although pairwise allometry
among structures varied in some instances the relationship was nearly isometric (Table 2). Thus, possible developmental constraints, limiting the degree to which
structure volumes vary independently of other structures,
cannot be ruled out [13,14]. The telencephalon, optic
tecta and cerebellum showed similar evolutionary patterns as shown by their highly similar MDI values and by
the fact that none differed significantly from Brownian
motion (Fig 1c, d). It is interesting to note that in mammals highly interconnected structures have been shown to
evolve in a correlated fashion [3], and the telencephalon
is highly interconnected with both the optic tecta and cerebellum [30]. Such apparent co-evolution between these
structures could result from developmental constraints,
however it could also be the result them evolving as a
functional system, as has been suggested to be the case for
correlated structures in mammals [3]. Hence, high neural
connectivity among structures can potentially limit the
strength of the signal for mosaic evolution, as some structures would show signals of concerted evolution.
There is some discordance among the results of the rate of
evolution analyses for whole brain size. While both the
low MDI value and the maximum likelihood estimate of
the λ parameter suggest that brain size evolution does not
depart from Brownian motion, the maximum likelihood
estimate of the α parameter suggests that brain size evolution is possibly better described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model [31,32]. The value of α for brain size (1.54) is
much lower than that of both the olfactory bulbs and the
hypothalamus (2.61 and 2.02 respectively), both of
which showed the highest MDI values and lowest λ values, suggesting that if the rate of brain evolution indeed
proceeds faster than under Brownian motion it is still
much slower than that of the olfactory bulbs and the
hypothalamus [31]. Because the value of α for brain size
is only slightly larger than 1, suggesting relatively weak
strength of selection (or "pull" towards the optimum), it
is possible that the advantage of the OU model versus
Brownian motion is the inclusion of a selective optimum

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/238

rather than evolution of the trait being modeled on a flat
landscape. Finally, brain structures cannot evolve completely independently of brain size, as any change in brain
structure volume would inevitably influence brain size,
thus some degree of correspondence in the evolutionary
patterns is to be expected. In any case, non-Brownian evolution of brain size is not supported by either the λ parameter or by the low MDI value.

Conclusion
In sum, our results provide robust evidence for an important role of mosaic evolution of the cichlid brain, as
shown by the differing bivariate allometries among structures, the different rates of evolution of brain structures
and the apparent trade-off between primary sensory structures. These results are in line with previously described
associations between structure size and species' ecology in
Tanganyikan cichlids [16,22]. Furthermore, brain developmental patterns of other ray-finned fishes also suggest
a predominant role for mosaic evolution. The early development of the neural tube in zebrafish (Danio rerio) has
been shown to take place simultaneously in several independent centers. Differentiated neurons appear in small,
isolated, bilaterally symmetrical clusters which give rise to
specific structures, and the increase in differentiated neuron number occurs at different rates during development
in the different clusters [33]. Thus, as a result of such a
developmental pattern, it is possible that by increasing or
reducing the rate of accumulation of differentiated neurons at specific, independent clusters, final structure volume could be modified relatively independently from
other structures. Furthermore, differential growth patterns
of brain structures from the juvenile to adult stages could
accentuate initial differences. Comparison of brain
growth patterns in four cyprinid fish species showed that
there is much greater structural similarity among brains of
juveniles of different species than among brains of adult
specimens and species differences in brain morphology
apparently become increasingly pronounced by lifelong
allometric growth [34]. As would be predicted under a
mosaic model of evolution, differential growth of structures during the late-larval and juvenile periods has been
suggested to produce distinct types of brain organization
in cyprinids, probably related to different sensory capabilities [1,30,34]. A combination of initial developmental
differences and lifelong allometric growth of structures
could potentially also explain the variation in the bivariate allometric relationships between brain structures in
Tanganyikan cichlids and the next step is to analyze
potential ecological, behavioral and sexually selected correlates of brain structures.
Our results also highlighted some similarities in the evolution of mammal and cichlid brains. As in mammals the
most variable structure in Tanganyikan cichlids was the
olfactory bulbs. Moreover, highly interconnected strucPage 8 of 12

tures, the telencephalon, optic tecta and cerebellum,
showed signals of correlated evolution in the Tanganyikan cichlids, and in mammals it has been suggested that
patterns of correlated evolution can be to a great extent
predicted by anatomical connectivity [3]. Previous studies
have suggested there are several homologous structures
with conserved functions between mammalian and teleost telencephalons, notably the pallial structures [17,3537]. Our results thus add to the evidence for a common,
conserved developmental pattern, and possibly basic
organization, across vertebrates.

Methods
Data
We obtained volumetric measures of brain structures for
43 Tanganyikan cichlid species [see Additional file 1]. Our
sample included most Tanganyikan species for which
detailed phylogenetic information is available, and provides a representative sample of natural variation in the
lake, including 7 out of the 12 tribes into which Tanganyikan cichlids have been grouped [38].

Brains were collected from wild caught, sexually mature
individuals. Fish were first deeply anesthetized with benzocaine and then the head was severed and preserved in
4% paraformaldehyde in a phosphate buffer for tissue fixation and preservation. Whole brain weight (± 0.001 g)
was obtained from dissected brains following fixation. All
weights were obtained using a Precisa 125A electronic
scale (precision = 10-5 g; Precisa Instruments AG, Switzerland). All cranial nerves, optic nerves and meningeal
membranes were removed and the brain was severed from
the spinal cord 2 - 3 mm posterior of the dorsal medulla.
The number of days samples spent in paraformaldehyde
prior to dissection had no effect on brain weight even
when controlling for body weight (t = -0.83, p = 0.41, n =
194). Intraspecific sample sizes = 3 - 7 individuals, except
for one species for which we had two samples, and two
species for which we only had one sample [see Additional
file 1].
All dissections, digital images and measurements were
performed by the same person (AG-V). All were done
blindly since specimens were identified by number and
not species name. Digital images of the dorsal, ventral, left
and right sides of the brain were taken through a dissection microscope (Leica MZFLIII), using a digital camera
(Leica DFC 490 and Firecam v. 3.1 software). For each
image the brain was carefully placed on a Petri dish with
0.9% agar, which was solid but would yield to brains and
allow for them to be placed in such a manner to ensure
that the view of the brain being photographed was horizontal and both sides were symmetrical. For paired structures, both were measured and the volume was the sum of
the two structures. We followed the procedure of Pollen et
al. [16] to measure length, width and height of six key-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/238

structures: olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, optic tecta, cerebellum, hypothalamus and dorsal medulla. The volume
of each structure was quantified according to the ellipsoid
model: V = (L × W × H) π/6, which provides consistent
estimates of the volume of brain structures in Taganyikan
cichlids [16,21-23] even when compared to volumes
obtained from sectioning on a microtome followed by
staining [16]. Although the model sometimes over-estimates structure volume as compared to estimates from
sectioning, part of the overestimation is due to the shrinkage that occurs with the normal drying and dehydration
process during staining [16]. Because our approach is
based on interspecific patterns of phenotypic evolution,
such slight overestimation would bias our analyses if the
overestimation differs notably between species. However,
based on the limited amount of available data for comparison of volume estimates between the ellipsoid model
and volume estimates from sections [16], the overestimation of structure volume by the ellipsoid model appears
similar across species. To estimate repeatability the volume of all structures was measured twice on one randomly picked specimen from each of the 43 species. In all
cases the correlation coefficient between repeated measures for all structures was high, r > 0.98. To verify that
intraspecific variability was similar among structures, we
compared the species-specific standard errors across the 6
structures. There was no significant difference between
structures (F = 1.91, p = 0.09, df = 5, 257; none of the posthoc analyses were significant: range of p values = 0.22 1.00), suggesting that there is no systematic bias. All data
was log10 transformed and because some of the measures
were smaller than 1, we multiplied all data by 1000 prior
to log transformation [39].
In brief, the main functions of these six brain structures in
the vertebrate brain are as follows: the olfactory bulbs
receive olfactory signals, which are then relayed directly to
the telencephalon [2,4,40]. The telencephalon forms the
cognitive center of the vertebrate brain that processes all
sensory information and also plays important roles in
directing active movements as well as in learning and
memory [2,4,17,40]. A key function of the optic tecta,
especially in fishes, is to receive visual information, which
is then transferred to the telencephalon via the preglomerular zone [41,42], the optic tecta also receive other sensory modalities in addition to retinal inputs and appear to
play a role in control of movement [2,4,40,43]. The cerebellum is the center for motor control and coordinates
muscle activity, movements and balance [2,4,40],
although the cerebellum may also be involved in learning
and memory [44]. The hypothalamus is functionally connected to the pituitary gland and controls many basic
bodily functions such as reproduction and growth as well
as motivation and the autonomic nervous system
[2,4,40]. Finally, the dorsal medulla receives lateral line,
taste projections, and auditory information, with rostral

components processing mechanosensory lateral line stimuli and more caudal and medial aspects relating to taste
[2,4,40,45].
Phylogenetic multivariate allometry analyses
First, we analyzed allometric relationships among individual structures using co-variance based principal component analysis in R taking into account the phylogenetic
relationships among species. Principal components analysis assumes that the sample consists of independent data
points, an assumption that is violated by data from species sharing varying degrees of plylogenetic relatedness
[24,39]. Thus, the analyses were undertaken using species
specific values (rather than using evolutionary differences
between species, i. e. independent contrasts) and calculated based on the evolutionary variance-covariance
matrix among species given by the phylogenetic relationships among species [24]. Because some of our traits
showed significant departure from a Brownian motion
model of evolution (see Results), we did not compute the
evolutionary variance-covariance matrix based on a
Brownian motion model of evolution but rather on a
matrix corrected by the lambda parameter (see below;
[24,27,46]). For this correction we used the average value
of the maximum likelihood estimates of lambda for the
six brain structures, each of which was estimated for each
structure individually (see below). Although we acknowledge that this estimate possibly differs from a multivariate
estimate for the data matrix as a whole, it is as yet not possible to estimate such parameters for multivariate data
sets.

The ratio of PC1 coefficients for any pair of variables corresponds to the variables' bivariate allometric coefficient
[25]. Under a concerted evolution model the bivariate
allometry among structures is not predicted to depart
markedly from isometry. Under a mosaic model bivariate
allometry is predicted to depart from isometry as structures grow or shrink independently of changes in size of
other structures. We used the loadings of the individual
structures on the first principal component as an estimate
of their correlation with variation in whole brain size.
Loadings are the correlation between the phenotypic data
and the component scores on the transformed space. Use
of multivariate allometric analyses has the advantage of
avoiding problems with adequate controls for size when
analyzing intercorrelations between structures as well as
problems of multicolinearity in multiple regression analyses, as structure volumes are often highly correlated
[39,47-49].
Phylogenetic comparative analyses
For the comparative analyses we used a molecular phylogeny reconstructed using mitochondrial sequences downloaded from Genbank (for details on phylogeny
reconstruction see [28]). The phylogeny has previously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/238

been shown to provide an accurate representation of speciation patterns for Tanganyikan cichlids [28]. All correlations controlling for phylogenetic effects were done using
phylogenetic generalized least squares [50] in R, using the
package ape [51]. To analyze patterns of evolution we
applied two complementary methods: the morphological
diversity index [26] and a maximum likelihood estimate
of the lambda (λ) and alpha (α) parameters [27]. Both
methods test for departure from a null Brownian motion
model of evolution, where phenotypic divergence accumulates with time in a stochastic manner, but differ in the
approach used to test for this departure, the additional
information they provide on rates of character evolution
as well as in their limitations [28].
To examine the patterns of morphological evolution, we
calculated disparity through time plots [26] for all brain
structures and brain weight, using the package GEIGER
[52] in R following Harmon et al. [26]. Morphological differences (disparity) were calculated from average pair wise
Euclidean distances between species. Disparity through
time was calculated as the average relative disparity of
each subclade by dividing the average disparity of all subclades whose ancestral lineages were present at that time
by the average disparity of the clade as a whole, and
repeating this at each divergence event (i.e., each node)
moving up the phylogeny from root to tip. A null hypothesis was constructed by simulating morphological divergence of each trait along the phylogeny under an
unconstrained Brownian motion model. The morphological diversity index (MDI) was calculated as the sum of the
areas between the curve describing the morphological disparity of the trait and the curve describing the disparity
under the null hypothesis of Brownian motion. Areas in
which observed values were above expected were assigned
positive values, whereas those below expected were
assigned negative values. The MDI thus describes how
morphological diversity is partitioned within the clade:
values above 0 indicate that most morphological disparity
is distributed within clades, suggesting recent phenotypic
divergence, negative values suggest disparity is distributed
among clades, suggesting early divergence, while values
near 0 indicate evolution has followed Brownian motion.
For ease of interpretation, in the disparity through time
plots we present the time scale as million of years to the
present, using 10 million years ago as an estimate for the
origin of the Tanganyikan cichlid radiation [38]. The
advantage of the MDI is that it avoids reconstruction of
ancestral states and it provides a graphical representation,
as well as a numerical index (MDI), of the pattern of morphological divergence along the phylogeny. A limitation
of the MDI is that there is no statistical test of departure
from the null Brownian motion model of evolution.
Second, we calculated maximum likelihood values for the
λ parameter which tests whether traits evolve according to

the null Brownian motion model (λ = 1)[27] and for the
α parameter, which is based on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
(OU) process and estimates the strength of selection acting on the trait [31,32], using the package GEIGER [52].
The OU model is the simplest mathematical expression
for an evolutionary model incorporating selection and it
differs from a Brownian model in that it possesses a selective optimum [31]. It is important to note, however, that
it also includes Brownian motion as a special case [31].
The OU model has two terms:

dX(t) = a [q − X(t)]dt + s dB(t)
the first term describes change in character × over the
course of a small increment in time, the second term is
random variation accumulating with time, or in other
words a Brownian process [31]. The parameter α describes
the strength of selection, the higher the value of α, the
stronger the selective regime; θ is the value of the selective
optimum [31]. Under an OU model, the rate of phenotypic change along the branches of a phylogeny depends
on two things, the distance between the actual trait value
and the value of the selective optimum, and the strength
of the "pull" towards the selective optimum, given by the
value of α. Hence, the higher the value of α, the stronger
the "pull" towards the selective optimum, in other words
as α increases divergence will accumulate increasingly rapidly along the branches of the tree as compared to a basic
Brownian process [31]. It can also be seen that as α
becomes increasingly small the OU model will eventually
reduce to a Brownian process and as α tends towards 1 the
process will reduce to a model with one selective optimum but with no accelerated accumulation of divergence
[31]. Because the OU model is to a certain point an extension of the Brownian model, traits presenting very small
departures from Brownian motion may yield higher likelihood values when their evolution is modeled by an OU
process. When comparing between models the importance lies in the value of α and thus the strength of the
selection regime. We refrained from estimating maximum
values of δ because it has been suggested that this parameter, which is similar to Grafen's ρ, could be biased [29].

Under a concerted evolution model we predicted that all
brain structures would present similar patterns of evolution and that these would follow those of whole brain
size, since structures are predicted to increase in size as a
response of changes in whole brain size [13,14]. On the
other hand, under a mosaic evolution model we would
expect divergence in patterns of evolution between whole
brain size and individual brain structures, and especially
among structures, as these are predicted to vary in size
independently [1].

The advantage of using GEIGER to estimate the values of
the evolutionary parameters is that it can incorporate an
estimate of intraspecific variance into the analyses, in this
case the standard error of volumes of brain structures and
brain weight for each species (in the few cases where a single sample was available for a species the error was set to
0). A p-value was obtained by comparing the models with
the λ and α parameters to a null model of unconstrained
Brownian motion with the log-likelihood statistic. By
combining three analyses of the rates of evolution, a result
suggesting departure from Brownian motion will be
robust if all three results present patterns which are consistent with a departure from Brownian motion [28].
