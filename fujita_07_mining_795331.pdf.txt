Abstract
Background: Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are the 21st and 22nd amino acids, which are
genetically encoded by stop codons. Since a number of microbial genomes have been completely
sequenced to date, it is tempting to ask whether the 23rd amino acid is left undiscovered in these
genomes. Recently, a computational study addressed this question and reported that no tRNA gene
for unknown amino acid was found in genome sequences available. However, performance of the
tRNA prediction program on an unknown tRNA family, which may have atypical sequence and
structure, is unclear, thereby rendering their result inconclusive. A protein-level study will provide
independent insight into the novel amino acid.
Results: Assuming that the 23rd amino acid is also encoded by a stop codon, we systematically
predicted proteins that contain stop-codon-encoded amino acids from 191 prokaryotic genomes.
Since our prediction method relies only on the conservation patterns of primary sequences, it also
provides an opportunity to search novel selenoproteins and other readthrough proteins. It
successfully recovered many of currently known selenoproteins and pyrrolysine proteins.
However, no promising candidate for the 23rd amino acid was detected, and only one novel
selenoprotein was predicted.
Conclusion: Our result suggests that the unknown amino acid encoded by stop codons does not
exist, or its phylogenetic distribution is rather limited, which is in agreement with the previous
study on tRNA. The method described here can be used in future studies to explore novel
readthrough events from complete genomes, which are rapidly growing.

Background
Stop codon readthrough is a phenomenon in which the
translation process does not terminate at a stop codon,
and an amino acid is inserted there instead [1,2]. In some
cases, the inserted amino acid is not one of the 20 amino
acids but a noncanonical one. Two such amino acids have

been discovered to date: selenocysteine [3,4] and pyrrolysine [5,6]. Because each of them have specialized tRNA
genes for decoding and can be considered extensions of
the standard genetic code, they are called the 21st and
22nd amino acids, respectively. Selenocysteine, the 21st
amino acid, is encoded by stop codon UGA, and organ-

isms that use selenocysteine have been found from all
three domains of life. Its insertion into UGA is directed by
SECIS (selenocysteine insertion sequence) elements, a
stem-loop structure on the selenoprotein mRNA. Along
with the progress of genome sequencing projects, computational prediction methods of selenocysteine-containing
proteins (selenoproteins) have been developed by several
research groups [7-10], and the repertoire of selenoproteins has been greatly expanded [11,12]. Pyrrolysine, the
22nd amino acid encoded by stop codon UAG, was
recently discovered from a methanogenic archaea [5,6].
Currently, only methanogenic archaea of the order Methanosarcinales and one bacterium are considered to utilize
pyrrolysine [13]. The limited phylogenetic distribution of
pyrrolysine suggests that its incorporation into the genetic
code of methanogen is relatively recent, and the insertion
mechanism of a novel amino acid can evolve in a shorter
period of time than anticipated.
This raises an interesting question: "Is there a 23rd amino
acid?" If such an amino acid is discovered, it will deepen
our understanding of the evolution and diversity of the
genetic code. Because genome sequences of various
prokaryotes are available today, there will be a chance to
discover the novel amino acid via analysis of these
genomes. Since both the 21st and 22nd amino acids are
encoded by stop codons, the prime suspect is other stop
codons (e.g. stop codon UAA), although the possibility of
sense codons certainly remains. Using this clue, computational screening methods of the 23rd amino acid can be
designed. Recently, Lobanov et al. addressed this problem
by searching tRNAs with anticodons corresponding to
stop codons [14]. They analyzed 146 prokaryotic
genomes, but no likely tRNA of the novel amino acid was
detected. They concluded that the 23rd amino acid would
have a limited phylogenetic distribution, if it exists.
However, programs for tRNA identification are based on
the features of known tRNAs and do not necessarily perform well on unknown ones. Actually, tRNASec and
tRNAPyl have unusual secondary structures [5,15] and
often escape detection by programs without special consideration. Lobanov et al. thus developed a sensitive
search method to deal with this problem, but they also
admitted that it would fail to identify highly unusual
tRNAs. There is another approach to searching for the
23rd amino acid. By enumerating ORFs that have an
inframe stop codon from genomes and examining their
evolutionary conservation, candidate proteins can be predicted. Because such an ORF-based study is independent
from the tRNA analysis, it can either identify candidate
organisms missed by the previous study or strengthen its
negative conclusion.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/225

Here we report a comprehensive analysis of prokaryotic
ORFs that contain an inframe stop codon. Through enumeration of theoretical ORFs and inspection of their evolutionary conservation, candidates of readthrough
proteins were predicted. They contained many of the
known proteins with stop-codon-encoded amino acids,
but almost no novel candidates were identified. Therefore, the unknown amino acid, if it is encoded by a stop
codon, is unlikely to exist in the current databases of
microbial genomes. The consequences for selenoproteins
and other readthrough genes are also discussed.

Results
Basic ideas
In this study, we focus on theoretical ORFs with one
inframe stop codon, termed "interrupted ORFs" (iORFs)
(Figure 1a). If we enumerate all iORFs from microbial
genomes, most of the readthrough genes will be included
in them. However, the vast majority of the enumerated
iORFs will be biologically meaningless. To filter out such
meaningless iORFs, we required the iORFs to have at least
one homolog in other genomes, because evolutionary
conservation of primary sequence is a strong indicator of
functional importance. However, this condition is not
sufficient, since two major problems remain: pseudogenes and two adjacent genes. The first problem is that
even if an iORF has homologs in other species, it could be
a pseudogene or a product of sequencing error. The second problem is that adjacent genes on the same reading
frame may satisfy the condition of conserved iORFs. In
particular, gene pairs within an operon are problematic
because their gene arrangement is often conserved. If the
intergenic distance between two genes in an operon happens to be a multiple of three, they look like a conserved
readthrough gene.

To discriminate them from true readthrough genes, evolutionary information was exploited. In order to eliminate
pseudogenes and sequencing errors, conservation of
iORFs and their inframe stop codons was examined. Since
pseudogenes are less conserved, and sequencing errors are
relatively rare events, they will not have homologous
iORFs in other species. Even if they do, the position or
type (UAA, UAG or UGA) of their inframe stop codons
will not coincide. In this way, they can be eliminated as
candidates. A drawback of this criterion is that it limits the
target of our study to readthrough genes conserved across
two or more species. In other words, species-specific
readthrough genes are not in the scope of this study.
To address the second problem, adjacent gene pairs were
filtered out by examining boundaries of sequence alignments between iORFs and its homologs (Figure 1b). The
stop-codon-encoded amino acids of prokaryotes are usually located inside domains, the units of evolutionary

that do not cover the inframe stop codon will be found.

sequence conservation. Therefore, the aligned regions of
readthrough proteins contain their inframe stop codon.
Based on this observation, each iORF was required to
have: (i) at least one homolog from other organisms that
covers the inframe stop codon and (ii) no homolog that
does not cover the stop codon. Note that, however, if the
whole length of an iORF was used as a query sequence,
this procedure will erroneously discard multidomain
readthrough proteins. To avoid this problem, a partial
sequence around the inframe stop codon was used as a
query.
Prediction procedure
The prediction schema is shown in Figure 2. A total of 191
prokaryotes were analyzed in this study, of which 166 are
bacteria and 25 are archaea. They were selected from 328
prokaryotes with completely sequenced genomes by
excluding closely related species. From the genome
sequences of the 191 organisms, all possible iORFs were
enumerated. Two conditions were imposed on the geometry of the iORFs (Figure 1a). First, only iORFs longer than
80 codons were extracted. Secondly, margins between the

inframe stop codon and both termini of the iORF must be
longer than 10 codons. The total number of iORFs
extracted under these conditions was 2,969,958. Next,
iORFs that overlap RNA genes or protein-coding genes in
different reading frames were discarded. This test significantly reduced the number of iORFs to 390,926.
As noted above, the target of this study is evolutionarily
conserved iORFs. Thus, it was examined whether the
iORFs have homologous regions in other genomes. The
390,926 iORFs were translated into amino acid sequences
and subjected to TBLASTN [16] against the 191 genome
sequences. Instead of the whole length of the amino acid
sequence, a window of 101 residues centered at the
inframe stop codon was used as a BLAST query. After the
BLAST searches, iORFs that have at least one interspecific
hit that contains the inframe stop codon were collected.
Whether the codon aligned to the inframe stop codon is a
nonsense codon or not was neglected at this stage. There
were 94,690 iORFs that have interspecific hits. The result
of the above homology searches was also used for the
boundary analysis (Figure 1b). An iORF was discarded if

ing procedures were applied to remove the false positives.
Briefly, the first filter assesses protein-likeliness based on
the signal of purifying selection, while the second and
third filters try to remove adjacent gene pairs using the
pattern of BLAST alignments (for details, see Materials
and Methods). As a result of the filtering, the number of
candidate clusters was reduced to 32. Through manual
inspection of the BLAST alignments, 11 clusters were discarded because they are highly unlikely to code
readthrough proteins.

there were any BLAST hits that do not cover the inframe
stop codon. A total of 26,003 iORF satisfied the above criteria.
To examine intrafamily conservation of the inframe stop
codons, these iORFs were clustered into protein families
based on sequence similarity. After removal of singletons,
679 clusters with two or more members were obtained. A
cluster was discarded unless all members of the cluster
had the same type of inframe stop codons (UAA, UAG or
UGA). The locations of the inframe stop codons were also
required to be identical in the multiple sequence alignment of the cluster members. These conditions reduced
the number of clusters to 273.
Manual inspection of these 273 clusters revealed that they
still contain many false positives that are unrelated to
stop-codon-encoded amino acids. Hence, three-step filter-

Known proteins in the predicted clusters
The clusters predicted by our method are summarized in
Table 1. Of the 21 clusters, 15 were known selenoproteins,
and four were known pyrrolysine proteins. To assess the
sensitivity of our method, the result was compared with a
list of prokaryotic selenoproteins reported by Kryukov
and Gladyshev [12]. Since our target is readthrough genes
conserved across two or more species, such selenoprotein
families were selected from their list. There were 15 families satisfying this criterion, but one family, proline
reductase, was excluded because it was found in only one
organism in our dataset. Of the 14 families, 11 were found
in our prediction result. The three families we failed to
find were SelW-like protein, peroxiredoxin and thiol:protein disulphide oxidoreductase. SelW-like protein was
below the threshold of detection, because its stop codon
is near the N-terminus and the amino acid sequences of its
members are too divergent. The reason why the two other
families were not detected is more complex. Since these
two families are homologous, they were grouped into an
identical cluster at the clustering stage of our method.
However, the positions of selenocysteine were different
between the two families (Figure 3). The cluster was thus
discarded because of an apparent lack of stop codon conservation. To deal with a situation like this, a reexamination of the clustering threshold and subdivision of clusters
will be required.

Of the four pyrrolysine proteins detected, three methylamine methyltransferases have been experimentally confirmed to contain pyrrolysine [6,17]. The rest is a cluster
of TetR-like transcriptional regulators from Methanosarcina acetivorans and M. barkeri. Since the genome annotation of M. acetivorans describes this protein as a gene
containing an inframe amber codon, we classified it as a
'known' candidate, although it is still unclear whether it
really contains pyrrolysine. The genome annotation of M.
acetivorans also includes several amber-containing genes
that were absent from our prediction result. They are a
methlycobamide:CoM methylase and four transposases
[18]. The reason why they were not detected is that only
one species in our dataset had an amber-containing form
of these proteins. This is unavoidable because of the inability of our method to detect species-specific readthrough

events. It is the price for reliably excluding pseudogenes
and sequencing errors.
Unknown candidates in the predicted clusters
The successful detection of many known proteins is
encouraging, because our method relies only on general
properties of proteins that contain stop-codon-encoded
amino acids, but not on specific features of selenocysteine
or pyrrolysine. Therefore, unknown clusters in our candidates have possibilities for the 23rd amino acid or novel
readthrough proteins. There were two such clusters (Table
1). The first cluster is comprised of c-type cytochromes
from δ-proteobacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens. The N-terminal part of the sequence contains
five CXXCH heme-biding motifs, while the C-terminal
part has no similarity with any characterized proteins.
Homology search against unfinished microbial genomes
identified seven homologous proteins from four other δproteobacteria species. Multiple sequence alignment of
these sequences is shown in Figure 4a.

We expect that this cluster may represent a novel selenoprotein family. This is because the inframe stop codons of
these proteins are exclusively TGA, and all of the above
organisms possess selenocysteine insertion machinery
(data not shown). High conservation of residues near the
inframe stop codon also suggests the importance of this
region. If they are true selenoproteins, this protein family
becomes a rare instance of selenoprotein that lacks nonselenocysteine homologs. However, computational analysis of sequences immediately downstream of the inframe
stop codons failed to identify SECIS elements, which is a
hallmark of selenocysteine-containing genes. Therefore,
yet another possibility is that they are a highly conserved
operon. An experimental verification is necessary to distinguish these two possibilities.
The second cluster consists of two hypothetical proteins,
again from G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens (Figure
4b). In contrast to the first cluster, no homolog was identified from other species. This cluster is probably a false
positive and not readthrough proteins. This is because the
residues near the inframe stop codons are poorly conserved. Moreover, the C-terminal extensions are quite
short (about 20 aa). The sequence conservation in this
region can be easily explained by the close phylogenetic
relationship between the two species. In summary,
although a possible selenoprotein was newly identified,
there was no promising candidate for an unknown amino
acid encoded by a stop codon.
Stop codon usage in the pre-filtering clusters
The above negative result could be explained if the filtering process, which is the final step of the prediction
method (Figure 2), was too strict. Although the raw out-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/225

put of the search for evolutionarily conserved iORFs was
273 clusters, most of them were discarded at the subsequent filtering stage. Because we have no a priori knowledge about the 23rd amino acid, cutoff thresholds for the
filtering procedures were determined based on the known
readthrough proteins. This is practically indispensable for
objective classification of candidates, but there is no guarantee that unknown proteins with the 23rd amino acid
will score higher than the thresholds.
To explore whether a number of good candidates lie
below the thresholds, the 273 clusters were analyzed in a
way independent from filtering. If an organism has many
readthrough proteins, proteins from the organism will frequently appear in the 273 clusters. Moreover, relative
usage of the inframe stop codons will deviate from that of
usual termination signals in the proteome. Figure 5 shows
the discrepancies between relative usage of the inframe
and C-terminal stop codons of 127 organisms in the prefiltering clusters. Only seven organisms had statistically
significant discrepancies (P < 0.05), and all of them are
known to utilize selenocysteine or pyrrolysine.
When top ten organisms were examined, only Gluconobacter oxydans was an organism not known to have stopcodon-encoded amino acids. An inspection of the G. oxydans iORFs in the 273 clusters revealed that their inframe
stop codons are dominated by TAA, but all of them
belong to a single protein cluster associated with transposable elements. Because it seems unlikely that an insertion
system of novel amino acid evolves solely for transposable elements, this organism cannot be considered as a
good candidate of the 23rd amino acid. Sensitivity of this
test is not high because many organisms that utilize selenocysteine were below the defined threshold. However, the
result agrees with the filtering-dependent analysis that no
candidate of the novel stop-codon-encoded amino acid is
detectable in the current dataset.

Discussion
As the number of completely sequenced genomes
increases, several research groups started to predict proteins that contain stop-codon-encoded amino acids
through computational analyses. Most of them are aimed
at identification of selenoproteins, reflecting concerns
from the scientific community and accumulated knowledge on selenocysteine. In order to improve prediction
specificity, they have fully exploited the known features of
selenocysteine, such as the SECIS elements or cysteine
homologs, which have cysteine in place of selenocysteine.
However, since the target of this study is the 23rd amino
acid, and there is no a priori knowledge, only general
properties of stop-codon-encoded amino acids can be
used for prediction. Such general-purpose algorithms
have also been developed to date. The method of Chaud-

A plus sign in a locus indicates that the genomic coordinates of the iORF can be described by a concatenation of two genes or regions. For example,
"GSU2293 + downstream" means that the iORF consists of the gene GSU2293 and its downstream sequence. HesB family was not clustered into
one family, because their sequences were too short and diverged.

huri and Yeates [10] extracts iORFs from microbial
genomes and analyzes sequence conservation around the
inframe stop codon. Their method is thus similar to ours
and applicable to both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine.
Perrodou et al. [19] constructed a database of predicted
recoding events in microbes. Their method is applicable
not only to stop codon readthrough but also to
frameshift.
However, both of them did not apply their methods to
search for novel amino acids. Therefore, the question of
the 23rd amino acid has not been investigated from the
viewpoint of coding sequences. Additionally, the previous
methods cannot effectively discriminate pseudogenes
from readthrough genes. For instance, Chaudhuri and
Yeates reported a homolog of cobalamin biosynthesis
protein CobN as a novel candidate of pyrrolysine protein.
However, the gene is probably a pseudogene because it
contains an inframe TAA codon in addition to the TAG
codon, and only one species seems to have the ambercontaining form of the gene.
The previous methods also assume that proteins with
stop-codon-encoded amino acids will have nonreadthrough homologs (i.e., homologous proteins that
do not have inframe stop codons). However, that is not
necessarily true. For example, pyrrolysine-containing
monomethylamine methyltransferases adopt TIM barrel
fold [6], but their primary sequences do not exhibit

detectable similarity to other TIM barrel proteins because
of evolutionary divergence. Dimethylamine methyltransferases also lack non-readthrough homologs. Yet another
example is glycine reductase selenoprotein A. Only the
selenocysteine-containing form of the enzyme is currently
known [20]. Therefore, it is important not to assume nonreadthrough homologs for exploring novel candidates. If
any non-readthrough homologs are registered in public
sequence databases, a careful annotation process of a
newly sequenced genome will be able to detect
readthrough genes, even though they may be annotated as
pseudogenes. However, if all members of a gene family
have stop codon readthrough, correct annotation of their
gene structure will be extremely difficult, and all of them
will be split into two distinct genes.
The method reported here is unique in that it does not
assume non-readthrough homologs. Using this method, a
systematic screening of the 23rd amino acid and other
readthrough genes was carried out. Many of the currently
known selenoproteins and pyrrolysine proteins were
recovered, indicating the effectiveness of this approach. In
particular, successful detection of pyrrolysine-containing
methyltransferases and selenoprotein A should be noted.
However, almost no novel candidates for readthrough
genes were predicted. What can be concluded from this
result? The most likely explanation is that the 23rd amino
acid does not exist, or its distribution on the tree of life is
rather limited. Although a broad spectrum of taxonomic

groups has been subjected to genome sequencing, the
genomes of most microbial species on the earth have yet
to be determined. The unknown amino acid may be used
by these species. Alternatively, only one organism in our
dataset may have the 23rd amino acid. This is because our
method is limited to readthrough genes conserved across
two or more species. If the novel amino acid appears in
younger, non-conserved sequences, our technique will
miss them. In either case, the distribution of the 23rd
amino acid will be significantly narrower than that of
selenocysteine, which has scattered but wide distribution
[21]. This conclusion coincides with and strengthens that
of the previous research on tRNA [14].
Yet another possibility is that the 23rd amino acid exists
but is not encoded by stop codons. It is well known that
the genetic code varies in several organisms [22]. Thus,
certain organisms may use one of the sense codons for the
novel amino acid. Because codons for most amino acids
are degenerate, redefinition of one of them is feasible.
However, that possibility is beyond the scope of this study
and is left as an open problem. Bioinformatics analysis of
unusual tRNA genes and codon usage may provide
insights into this problem.
In addition to the 23rd amino acid, our method can
simultaneously explore selenoproteins and other
readthrough proteins. A common assumption in microbial selenoprotein predictions is that selenoproteins will
have cysteine homologs. Zhang et al. [20] examined the
validity of this assumption using a SECIS-based method
and concluded that selenoproteins without cysteine
homologs will be extremely rare. Our method can reassess
this assumption in a SECIS-independent way. Such

selenoproteins identified through our screening of nearly
200 microbial genomes were selenoprotein A and only
one uncertain candidate. Therefore, selenoproteins that
lack cysteine homologs will be scarce, as previously
reported.
Other readthrough proteins with canonical amino acids
(i.e., proteins that have canonical amino acids at their
inframe stop codons) are quite rare in prokaryotes [1].
The result reported here is in agreement, but it is not conclusive. This is because our method assumes that stopcodon-encoded amino acid is located inside a domain,
but it is unclear whether it holds true in prokaryotic
readthrough with canonical amino acids. At least, only
one experimentally-confirmed example from a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli [23], whose genome is not
yet determined, does not obey this rule. What can be concluded from our result is that this type of readthrough will
be located outside of domains, such as a linker between
two domains. Such a stop codon may behave as a switch
that regulates production of short and long isoforms from
a single mRNA, as in readthrough genes from viruses [24].

Conclusion
To explore the possibility of a 23rd amino acid, ORFs in
prokaryotic genomes were investigated in a comprehensive way. Although many of the currently known selenoproteins and pyrrolysine proteins were successfully
detected, no candidate for the 23rd amino acid was discovered. Therefore, if such an amino acid exists, it will
have limited distribution in the tree of life. Alternatively,
it may be encoded by one of the sense codons. From the
viewpoint of selenoprotein prediction, the sensitivity of
our method was lower than an existing method. However,

Discrepancies of stop codon usages between the inframe and C-terminal stop codons
Discrepancies of stop codon usages between the inframe and C-terminal stop codons. The inframe stop codon usage is taken
from the pre-filtering clusters, and the C-terminal usage is computed based on the annotated proteins of the organism. Red circle: an organism with pyrrolysine, blue; selenocysteine, yellow; both pyrrolysine and selenocysteine, white; neither pyrrolysine
nor selenocysteine. The organisms are ordered by their discrepancy scores. The discrepancy score is the negative logarithm of
a p-value of Fisher's exact test. The dotted line indicates significance level 0.05 after a correction for multiple testing.
our method has several unique features. It is applicable to
general readthrough genes and rigorously excludes pseudogenes and sequencing errors. Moreover, it does not
assume the occurrence of non-readthrough homologs in
the public databases. It will help in identification of novel
readthrough genes from the rapidly expanding collection
of complete microbial genomes.

Methods
Enumeration of iORFs from prokaryotic genomes
A total of 328 complete genome sequences of prokaryotes
were downloaded from the KEGG FTP site [25] in April
2006. From them, 191 representative organisms were
selected by excluding close relatives. The threshold was set
to average sequence identity 90% of two house-keeping
genes, DNA polymerase III α subunit and alanyl-tRNA
synthetase. From these 191 genomes, iORFs longer than
80 codons were enumerated using inhouse software,
which is available from the author's web site [26]. Both
upstream and downstream regions of its inframe stop
codon were required to be longer than 10 codons. Two
stop codons of an iORF (i.e. the inframe and C-terminal
stops) can be any combination of canonical stop codons
(TAA, TAG, TGA). However, for Mycoplasma, only TAA
and TAG were used. Three codons ATG, TTG and GTG
were allowed to be start signals.

The iORFs of each organism were compared with proteincoding genes of the organism using BLASTX. If an iORF
matched any protein-coding genes (E-value < 10-3) and
their reading frames did not coincide, the iORF was discarded. Similarly, iORFs were compared with RNA genes
using BLASTN, and those matched with the RNAs were
removed. Remaining iORFs were translated into amino
acid sequences. We translated all three types of nonsense
codons into the one-letter code U, so as to simplify visual
inspection of sequence alignments. Although the code U
is usually for selenocysteine, it will be harmless because U
is automatically converted into × inside the BLAST programs.
Construction of clusters of conserved iORFs
To examine evolutionary conservation of the iORFs, a
window of 101 residues around the inframe stop codon
was extracted and subjected to TBLASTN searches against
the above 191 genome sequences. If there were any hits
(E-value < 0.01) in other organisms, and if the hit includes
10 upstream and 10 downstream residues of the inframe
stop codon, then the iORF was retained. However, if there
were any hits (E-value < 10-5) that did not cover the
inframe stop codon, the iORF was discarded. Eligible
iORFs were then clustered using BLASTCLUST with score
density 0.5 and minimum length coverage 0.6. After

removing singleton clusters, multiple sequence alignments of the remaining clusters were computed using
MAFFT [27] with the L-INS-i option. Subsequently, conservation of the inframe stop codons in each cluster was
examined. If the location or type of stop codons was not
identical, the cluster was discarded.
Three-step filtering of the candidate clusters
The first filter examines protein-likeliness of the iORFs.
This filter is mainly designed to remove conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) immediately downstream of
non-readthrough genes. If we measure purifying selection
for amino acid sequences by the ratio of nonsynonymous
to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS), a protein with
a stop-codon-encoded amino acid will indicate the sign of
selection, while CNS will not. The dN/dS was calculated
for each of the two parts flanking the inframe stop codon
in an iORF using codeml program in the PAML package
[28]. Statistical significance was estimated by likelihood
ratio test [29]. The observed alignment was fitted to two
distinct substitution models, one of which estimates dN/
dS from the data, and the other fixes it to 1.0. Let lfree and
lfix denote log likelihood of these models. Then, 2Δl =
2(lfree – lfix) approximately follows the χ2 distribution with
one degree of freedom. If dN/dS was less than 1.0, and the
statistics 2Δl was larger than a threshold, we regard it as a
sign of purifying selection. In this study, the threshold was
set to 5.0 (corresponds to P < 0.025) so that the known
readthrough proteins score higher than the threshold. For
each of the above clusters, an all-against-all comparison of
cluster members was performed. If any pair exhibits such
signals in both the N- and C-terminal parts, the cluster
was retained.

Even if both the upstream and downstream regions of the
inframe stop codon code proteins, they may be two adjacent genes instead of a readthrough protein. The second
and third filtering processes remove such genes based on
BLAST alignment patterns. Although the boundary analysis applied previously has the same goal (Figure 1b), some
gene pairs escaped elimination. To enhance sensitivity of
the filters, the whole length of an iORF was used as a
BLAST query instead of the partial sequence, and the size
of the BLAST database was increased from the 191 nonredundant genomes to the 328 complete genomes in
GenomeNet and 246 draft genome sequences downloaded from GenBank in May 2006.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/225

tistically significant (E-value < 10-5), and distance between
them is less than 1 kbp, we call these hits 'syntenic hits'. If
any syntenic hits with non-coinciding reading frames
were found, the cluster was removed.
The third filter uses co-occurrence of residues around the
inframe stop codon as another source of information for
screening stop codon readthrough. Suppose a window of
21 residues centered at the inframe stop codon. In
prokaryotes, most stop-codon-encoded amino acids are
located inside a domain, the unit of evolutionary
sequence conservation. Therefore, in an ideal situation the
presence or absence of the 21 residues in alignments will
be synchronized. In contrast, if the iORF is actually two
adjacent genes, then upstream and downstream residues
of the stop codon will appear separately in many alignments. We defined a co-occurrence matrix as a 21 × 21
matrix whose (i,j)-th element represents how often residue i and j appeared simultaneously in N alignments. The
matrix elements were subsequently normalized to the
number of alignments N. By definition, the more often
the upstream and downstream residues of the inframe
stop codon co-occur in the alignments, the higher the
density in the upper right quarter of the matrix. If average
density in the quarter was lower than 0.85, the cluster was
filtered out.
Stop codon usage
For each organism, its iORFs were extracted from the prefiltering clusters, and codon usage at the inframe stop
positions was counted. Codon usage at the C-terminal
stop codons in its proteome was also computed using data
of coding sequences downloaded from KEGG GENES
[25]. These data were combined into a 3 × 2 matrix, and
Fisher's exact test was applied. The p-value was corrected
for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction
because there were 127 organisms in the pre-filtering clusters.

MF developed the method and drafted the manuscript.
HM conceived and coordinated the study. All authors
contributed to the writing, read and approved the final
manuscript.

The second filter inspects synteny of iORFs. If the N- and
C-terminal parts of an iORF have distinct but closely
arranged BLAST hits in other genomes, it strongly suggests
the iORF is actually two adjacent genes. Translated
sequences of iORFs in the pre-filtering clusters were subjected to TBLASTN searches against the genome database.
If both the best hits of the N- and C-terminal parts are sta-
