Abstract
Background: Escherichia coli have been found in increased numbers in tissues from patients with
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and adherent-invasive E. coli have been found in resected ileum
from patients with Crohn's disesae. This study aimed to characterize possible differences in
phylogenetic group (triplex PCR), extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) genes and multilocus
sequence type (MLST) between E. coli strains isolated from IBD patients with past or present
involvement of the left side of the colon and from controls.
Results: Fecal samples were collected from 18 patients and from 10 healthy controls. Disease
activity was evaluated by sigmoidoscopy. Interestingly, E. coli strains of the phylogenetic group B2
were cultured from 60% of patients with IBD compared to 11% of healthy controls (p < 0.05).
Furthermore, when comparing the number of E. coli B2 strains with at least one positive ExPEC
gene among different groups, 86% were found positive among active IBD patients, significantly more
than 13% among inactive IBD patients (p < 0.05), and 11% among healthy controls (p < 0.05). The
B2 phylogenetic group was found in a specific cluster based on MLST, but no further separation
between E. coli strains associated with active compared to inactive IBD was achieved.
Conclusion: In conclusion, E. coli of the phylogenetic group B2 were isolated more frequently
from IBD patients with past or present involvement of the left side of the colon compared to
healthy controls, and B2 strains with ExPEC genes were found more frequently among IBD patients
with active disease compared to patients with inactive disease.

Background
The pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been researched intensely. In general, it is
believed that both genetic and environmental factors are
involved. When IBD was originally described, a close
resemblance to infectious diseases of the gut was noticed.

Therefore, many different bacteria, viruses and other
microorganisms have been suspected to cause IBD. It is
now well established that luminal factors in the intestine
are involved in the inflammatory process of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). For example, diversion of the continuity of the intestines results in healing of

the resting gut, whereas the inflammation will return
when continuity is reestablished [1]. Furthermore, several
animal models have documented the participation of bacteria in the inflammatory process [2]. More importantly,
the recent finding of a defect in the caspase recruitment
domain family, member 15 (NOD2/CARD15), gene
among CD patients, has reawakened the search for specific involved pathogens [3]. NOD2/CARD15 is believed
to be involved in the innate immune system including the
production of defensins; therefore, defects in this gene
could indicate that the host is more susceptible to microorganisms [4]. It has also been shown that the number of
viable internalized S. typhimurium in Caco2 cells was
higher when the Caco2 cells were transfected with a variant CARD15/NOD2 expression plasmid associated with
Crohn's disease [5].
Escherichia coli are among the most interesting bacteria in
the human gut. Certain E. coli clones with specific virulence factors are involved in extraintestinal infections the
so called extraintestinal pathoghenic E. coli (ExPEC), and
these bacteria often cause both urinary tract infections and
septicemia. Furthermore, specific E. coli are involved in
childhood diarrhea, (enteropathogenic E. coli), tourist
diarrhea (enterotoxigenic E. coli), and recently, bloody
diarrhea associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome
(verotoxin-producing E. coli).
In the 1970's, it was found that hemolytic E. coli were
linked to active UC, although it was believed that the
hemolytic E. coli were innocent bystanders, and their presence in the colon was assisted by the inflammation but
did not cause it [6]. On the other hand, it has been shown
that apathogenic E. coli prevents relapse of UC just as well
as mesalazine [7]. Furthermore, E. coli has been linked to
CD, since an abundance of specific adherent-invasive E.
coli was found in resected ileum from patients with CD,
compared to non inflamed ileum resected due to other
causes [8,9]. Very recently, it was demonstrated by ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis that enterobacteriaceae
are more abundant in tissue samples from patients with
IBD compared to controls, and after culture, specific phylogenetic groups of E. coli were found to be more frequent
among patients with UC and CD [10]. Moreover, it has
been shown that E. coli are very predominant in inflamed
mucosa of patients with UC, and that these strains based
on 16 S rRNA PCR are "active" and overrepresented in
comparison with the microbiota of healthy controls, who
generally had a higher biodiversity of the active microbiota [11]. In addition, an exuberant inflammatory
response to E. coli has been demonstrated among patients
with UC [12].
The aim of our study was to characterize possible differences in phylogenetic group, serotype, ExPEC genes and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/171

virulence between E. coli isolated from patients with active
IBD, patients with inactive disease and healthy controls,
as well as to examine whether multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) could further distinguish between these E. coli.
MLST is considered the most stable and appropriate of
currently available molecular typing techniques for long
term epidemiology and for the identification of bacterial
lineages that have an increased propensity to cause disease
[13].

Results
Fecal samples were collected from 18 patients with IBD
with present or past involvement of the left side of the
colon and from 10 healthy controls. In both patients and
controls, a sigmoidoscopy was performed. Ten patients
were found to have a non-inflamed mucosa, whereas 8
had clear inflammation in the sigmoid colon. More
detailed characteristics of patients are presented in Table
1. A total of 26 E. coli strains were isolated from study subjects. From 3 patients and 1 control, no E. coli could be
isolated. From one patient with active IBD and one
patient with inactive IBD two different E. coli strains from
each patient were isolated based on MLST, serotyping and
phylogenetic typing. From all controls and all other
patients only one strain of E. coli from each subject was
isolated.
E. coli strains were studied with respect to phylogenetic
group, ExPEC genes, multilocus sequence type, serotype
and virulence factors. Interestingly, among patients and
controls with a positive E. coli culture, B2 strains were cultured most frequently from patients with IBD, 60% (9 out
of 15), compared to 11% (1 out of 9) from healthy controls (p < 0.05). In addition, B2 E. coli strains were cultured most frequently from patients with active IBD, 86%
(6 of 7), compared to 38% (3 of 8) among patients with
inactive colitis, but this difference did not reach statistical
significance (p = 0.12). However, when comparing the
number of B2 E. coli strains with at least one positive
ExPEC gene among different groups (table 2), significantly more strains, 86% (6 of 7), were found positive
among active IBD patients, compared to 13% (1 of 8)
among inactive IBD patients (p < 0.05) and 11% (1 of 9)
among healthy controls (p < 0.05). Among the 26 E. coli
strains, representing 20 O-serogroups, 18 sequence types
were identified using multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
(figure 1). The B2 phylogenetic group associated with IBD
was found in a specific cluster based on MLST, confirming
a common ancestry of these IBD associated B2 E. coli, but
no further separation was achieved between strains
involved in active compared to inactive IBD. From most
patients with active IBD, 71%, E. coli were cultured with
O-serotypes normally categorized as uropathogenic, compared to 25% (p = 0.13) in IBD in remission and 11%
among healthy controls (p < 0.05). Although hemolytic E.

coli were isolated more frequently from patients with IBD
(47%) compared to healthy controls (11%); this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.18).
No verotoxin producing strains were detected among the
26 E. coli isolates examined, and no other common virulence genes were significantly associated with disease
activity based on hybridization assays (table 3).

Discussion
In our study based on fecal samples from patients with
previous or present left-sided colitis and from controls, we
found a strong correlation between isolation of E. coli of
the phylogenetic group B2 and IBD; no correlation was
found with other phylogenetic groups including group D.
Further, we found a trend toward an association between
the presence of B2 E. coli and active colitis. A recent study
has demonstrated that the presence of specific E. coli
(both groups B2 and D), in colonic biopsies, are associated with IBD, however patients were not stratified
according to activity of the disease or to disease localization [10]. Our patients were well-defined regarding disease localization (left-sided colitis), which could explain
the very specific association between B2 E. coli and IBD in
our study. Controls (medical students) were younger than
IBD patients, however, in broad terms the colonic microbiota is generally viewed as being a stable entity within an
individual [14]. Moreover, previous studies of B2 E. coli
did not show an increase in the probability of detecting a
B2 E. coli with increasing age in the age groups participating in our study [15].

B2 strains are often found among ExPEC strains and when
testing for 6 genes commonly associated with ExPEC [16],
we found a statistically significant association between
active IBD and B2 strains with at least one positive ExPEC
gene, when comparing to both controls and to patients
with inactive disease. The enhanced virulence potential of
ExPEC strains is thought to be caused mainly by their multiple virulence factors such as adhesins, siderophores,
toxin polysaccharide coatings; e.g., these virulence factors
would help the bacteria to avoid host defenses, injure or
invade host cells and tissues and stimulate a noxious
inflammatory response [17]. It has been suggested that
features, which commonly have been regarded as virulence factors in ExPEC isolates, are also factors promoting
intestinal colonization [18-20]. This could explain why
ExPEC strains are more prevalent in patients with UC,
where the inflamed mucosa could prevent colonization
with E. coli of a more commensal nature.
Whether IBD associated B2 E. coli can be differentiated
from other B2 ExPEC strains is at present not known. In
this regard it was interesting to find a possible association
of the IBD associated B2 E. coli with afa, afimbrial
adhesin, an adhesin which exist in different subtypes
depending on the physiological site from which the afa
positive E. coli were isolated [21]. Furthermore, the afimbrial adhesin has been demonstrated to cause functional
lesions in the intestinal brush border, impairment of the
epithelial barrier and proinflammatory responses in cultured human intestinal cells that express the structural
and functional characteristics of human enterocytes [22].

MLST confirmed the common ancestry of the B2 E. coli,
since they were all found in the same phylogenetic group,
but unfortunately, no further information could be
obtained regarding stratification of the B2 E. coli from
active IBD patients compared to inactive IBD patients.
Previously B2 E. coli strains have been described using
MLST and subgroups have been identified [23], but our
B2 strains were of sequence types typically found in different subgroups, making further information regarding
these strains using MLST unlikely.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the clonal nature, based on MLST and phylogenetic group, of E. coli isolates from IBD patients with
left-sided colitis contradicts an assumption that IBD
through an impaired immune system simply allows an
overrepresentation of E. coli at random. Some active participation by the microorganism is certainly indicated,

either due to colonization advantages or as a part of IBD
pathogenesis. Future studies of the effects of IBD associated E. coli in both cell assays and animal models will help
to clarify the role of these bacteria in the inflammatory
process.

present involvement of the left side of the colon. The basic

Table 1
Samples and selection of E. coli isolates
Fecal samples from patients and controls were used in this
study. Fecal samples were collected by patients and controls and submitted for culture at the Department of Bacteriology, Mycology and Parasitology, Statens Serum
Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark, and E. coli colonies were
chosen for further characterization by a lab technician
without knowledge of the clinical data of the participating
patients and controls.
Microbiological methods
Fecal cultures were performed by suspending 10 μl or an
amount equivalent to 10 μl feces into 2 ml of phosphatebuffered saline (pH 7.38). The suspension was mixed, and
10 μl was plated on SSI enteric medium [26] and incubated at 37°C overnight. The plates were examined for the
colony characteristics, size, and colour of the cultured
organisms. Colonies with characteristic features for E. coli
were chosen for colony blot hybridization, serotyping and
MLST. The strains were confirmed as being E. coli by using

the Minibact E kit (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen,
Denmark) [27]
Serotyping
The isolates were serotyped according to standard methods [28] using the full set of antisera (Statens Serum Institut, Hillerød, Denmark).
DNA hybridization
Virulence genes of common E. coli pathotypes were
detected by DNA probe-hybridisation assays: verocytotoxin genes (vtx1, vtx2) intimin (eae), enterohemolysin
(ehxA), bundle-forming pili (bfpA), EAST1 (astA), marker
for enteroaggregative E. coli (aatA/CVD432) and marker
for diffuse adherence (SLM862) as described previously
[29,30].
MLST
MLST was performed according to the scheme described
at the E. coli MLST website maintained at the Max-Planck
Institut für Infektionsbiologie http://web.mpiib-ber
lin.mpg.de. The seven housekeeping genes were shown to
be unlinked on an E. coli K-12 genome map. Product
lengths varied from 583 to 932 bp. DNA was isolated

from the colonies using the ChargeSwitch® gDNA Mini
Bacteria Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and stored at
-20°C until required for PCR amplification.
Sequencing
PCR reactions were performed on the purified DNA using
PuReTaq Ready-To-Go™ PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited, Buckinghamshire, England) by adding 1 μl of extracted DNA (~10 ng DNA), 1 μl of each
primer (10 pmol μl-1) and 22 μl of water Mini-plasco®
(Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). Primer
sequences and cycling conditions were employed as
described on the MLST website. PCR was performed on a
GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). PCR products were purified with the
ChargeSwitch® PCR Clean-Up Kit (Invitrogen) and
sequenced by MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany).
Sequence analysis
Raw sequences were reviewed by visual inspection in
BioNumerics version 4.601 (Applied Maths, Sint-Mar-

tens-Latem, Beligium). DNA sequences were aligned and
trimmed. Obtained sequences were aligned against
known alleles in the database at the website, and allele
numbers and sequence types were assigned. In the case of
unknown alleles and/or sequence types, the new alleles
and sequence types were submitted to the database. The
phylogenetic tree is an UPGMA tree calculated in BioNumerics on the basis of the concatenated sequences.
Phylogenetic group
Phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2 and D) were determined
by a simple PCR procedure based on genes chuA, YjaA and
an anonymous DNA fragment, using primers and conditions exactly as described by Clermont et al [31].
ExPEC genes
The presence of six ExPEC genes, papA (P fimbriae), papC
(pilus assembly), afa (afimbrial adhesion), sfa/foc (Sfimbriae/F1Ccfimbriae), iut (aerobactin system) and kpsM
(kapsular synthesis) was detected by a PCR method, using

primers and conditions exactly as described by Johnson et
al [16].

Statistics
The number of hemolysin positive E. coli, E. coli of serotypes typical for ExPEC, E. coli, with at least one positive
ExPEC gene and B2 E. coli in different clinical groups were
assessed with the Fisher Exact test (2-tailed). P < 0.05 was
considered significant.
