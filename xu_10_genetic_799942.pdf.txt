Abstract
Background: The Mlabri are a group of nomadic hunter-gatherers inhabiting the rural highlands of Thailand. Little
is known about the origins of the Mlabri and linguistic evidence suggests that the present-day Mlabri language
most likely arose from Tin, a Khmuic language in the Austro-Asiatic language family. This study aims to examine
whether the genetic affinity of the Mlabri is consistent with this linguistic relationship, and to further explore the
origins of this enigmatic population.
Results: We conducted a genome-wide analysis of genetic variation using more than fifty thousand single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typed in thirteen population samples from Thailand, including the Mlabri, Htin
and neighboring populations of the Northern Highlands, speaking Austro-Asiatic, Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien
languages. The Mlabri population showed higher LD and lower haplotype diversity when compared with its
neighboring populations. Both model-free and Bayesian model-based clustering analyses indicated a close genetic
relationship between the Mlabri and the Htin, a group speaking a Tin language.
Conclusion: Our results strongly suggested that the Mlabri share more recent common ancestry with the Htin. We
thus provided, to our knowledge, the first genetic evidence that supports the linguistic affinity of Mlabri, and this
association between linguistic and genetic classifications could reflect the same past population processes.

Background
The Mlabri are a hill tribe in northern Thailand, inhabiting a dispersed area along the border with Laos [1,2].
Today, they are a small population of nomadic huntergatherers, unusual in a region of almost entirely agricultural economies [3]. The modern population size is estimated at around 300 individuals, with some estimates
being as low as 100 [4]. The name Mlabri is a Thai/Lao
alteration of the word Mrabri, which appears to derive
from a Khmuic term for “people of the forest” - in
Khmu, mra means “person” and bri “forest”. They are
also known locally as Phi Tong Luang or “spirits of the
yellow leaves”, apparently because they abandon their
shelters when the leaves begin to turn yellow with the
onset of the dry season.

Little is known about the origins of the Mlabri and
most evidence comes from linguistic studies. The Mlabri
language is classified as a Khmuic language, a subgroup
of the Mon-Khmer language in the Austro-Asiatic language family [5]. The available linguistic evidence suggests that the present-day Mlabri language most likely
arose from Tin, a Khmuic language [2,6]. However, so
far there is no genetic evidence supporting this idea. A
recent study suggested Mlabri was founded recently
from an agricultural group, thus representing a typical
example of cultural reversion [7]. This work, although
very interesting, was criticized for not including any of
populations neighboring the Mlabri, such as the Htin,
Hmong, and northern Thai. As a result, these authors
were unable to demonstrate any similarities in the
genetic and linguistic affinity of the Mlabri, and so
made little comment on the possible source population
(s) from which the Mlabri originated [8].
In this study, we analyzed populations samples from
throughout northern Thailand, including the Mlabri as
well as several neighboring groups, including the Htin,

Hmong, Yao, and other populations speaking Austro-Asiatic and Tai-Kadai languages. Four HapMap population
samples, representing Altaic, Sino-Tibetan, Indo-European
and Niger-Congo language speakers, were also included in
this study. We conducted a genome-wide analysis on
these samples using 50K SNPs, to investigate the genetic
affinity of the Mlabri, examine the concordance of genetic
and linguistic affinities, and further explore probable origin(s) of this enigmatic hunter-gatherer group.

Results
Genetic Characteristics of Mlabri

Since this is the first genome-wide genetic study of this
enigmatic population, we calculated several population

genetic parameters, including SNP diversity, haplotype
diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD).
Reduced genetic diversity in the Mlabri

Expected heterozygosity for SNPs (HSe) were calculated
based on allele frequencies of 55,561 SNPs and the
results were shown in Figure 1A. The HS e in Mlabri
(0.197) is lower than that of any of other populations in
which HSe is at least 0.250 (HM). The expected heterozygosity for haplotypes (HHe) were calculated based on
haplotypes in 500-kb genomic regions (Methods) and
the results are shown in Figure 1B. The HHe in Mlabri
(0.666) is also much lower than that of any of other
populations in which HH e is at least 0.820 (TN). The
HHe comparison obtained from larger size of genomic

regions (1 Mb) show the similar results (see Additional
file 1, Figure S1). All the above comparisons are statistically significant (t-test, p < 10-5).
We also compared genetic diversity among populations
using the cumulative proportion of the genome given
the number of haplotypes (see Methods). The number
of haplotypes was estimated for two different window
sizes (500-kb or 1-Mb) respectively, with adjustment for
sample size difference among populations (see Methods). Again, we found that the genetic diversity was significantly lower in Mlabri than in other populations for
both 500-kb segments (Figure 2A) and 1-Mb segments

Page 3 of 13

(Figure 2B), respectively. For example, in Mlabri, 99% of
the 500 kb segments across the genome carry 17 or less
haplotypes in Mlabri, and it is much larger than those
in other East Asian populations (52% ~68%), CEU
(48%), and YRI (20%).
Increased linkage disequilibrium in the Mlabri

The significantly reduced genetic diversity in Mlabri was
also reflected by its extent of linkage disequilibrium
(LD). We assessed the extent of LD among markers
with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.05 (Figure 3A, B)
and ≥ 0.1 (Figure 3C, D). The LD extended substantially
longer in Mlabri than all the other populations, measured as the fraction of SNP pairs with r2 ≥ 0.5 (Figure
3A, C) or r2 ≥ 0.8 (Figure 3B, D). For marker pairs with
moderate LD (r2 ≥ 0.5), we observed this fraction to be
1.6- to 12.3-fold higher in Mlabri than in all the other
Asian populations for the distance range above 10-kb to
200-kb. For those marker pairs with strong LD (r 2 ≥
0.8), the fraction in Mlabri is 2.2- to 31.3-fold higher in
Mlabri than in all the other Asian populations, and 6to 259-fold higher than in YRI. Furthermore, LD of r2 ≥
0.8 extended more than 1 Mb in Mlabri, whereas in all
the other populations, such strong LD extended only up
to 200 kb.
Genetic Affinity of Mlabri

The genetic characteristics obtained from above analysis,
such as significantly increased LD and extremely
reduced haplotype diversity are both consistent with the
view from a previous study [7] that the Mlabri were
recently founded from a very small number of individuals. The available linguistic evidence suggests that the
present-day Mlabri language arose from a Khmuic language, most likely Tin [2,6,7]. To search for the group
that gave rise to the founders of Mlabri and to examine
if the genetic affinity is consistent with linguistic affinity,
we further investigated the genetic relationship of
Mlabri and other populations. The rational is that the
group with closest genetic relationship with Mlabri, if
also consists with linguistic relationship, is most likely
the genetic and linguistic founder source.

We first studied the clustering relationships among 446
individuals representing 13 populations in Thailand and
the CHB and JPT from the HapMap project (YRI and
CEU samples were not included in this analysis). We
used an allele sharing distance (ASD) [9] as the genetic
distance between individuals and reconstructed an individual tree (Figure 4) using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm [10]. There are several clear clusters on the tree
which coincide with individual linguistic or ethnic
affiliations, for example, as denoted in Figure 4, JPT,
CHB, Hmong-Mien, Tai-Kadai, Austro-Asiatic, Htin and

between markers that had minor allele frequency ≥ 0.05 (A, B), ≥ 0.1 (C, D) and that fell into the same intermarker distance bin. Blue lines

Mlabri. Notably, all the Mlabri and Htin individuals
cluster together tightly (100 per cent bootstrap)
although there is a bifurcation between clusters of
Mlabri and Htin, indicating that the Mlabri have a closer relationship with the Htin than any of other populations studied.
The above clustering relationships among individuals
were also confirmed by principal components analysis
(PCA) at the individual level [11]. As shown in a 2dimentional plot of first two PCs (Figure 5A), individuals tend to cluster with other members of their linguistic or ethnic affiliations. Again, Mlabri showed a
closer relationship with the Htin for PC1, which
explains 21.8% of variation represented by the first ten
PCs. The closer relationship between Mlabri and Htin is
even more pronounced in the 2-dimentional plot of PC1
and PC3 (Figure 5B).
Since the closer relationship between Mlabri and
Htin could be due to recent gene flow from Htin to
Mlabri or vice versa, we further performed Bayesian
cluster analysis as implemented in the STRUCTURE
algorithm [12] to examine the ancestry of each person.
This analysis considers each person’s genome as having
originated from K ancestral, but unobserved,

populations whose contributions are described by K
coefficients that sum to 1 for each individual [13]. Individuals are posited to derive from an arbitrary number
of ancestral populations, denoted by K. We ran
STRUCTURE from K = 2 to K = 18, with results at
K = 8 showing the greatest posterior probability (see
Additional file 2, Figure S2). Estimated individual membership fractions in K genetic clusters are shown in
Figure 6A. At K = 3, the three clusters correspond with
Asian, European and African ancestry, respectively. At
K = 4, the new cluster corresponds to a Mlabri specific
component, which is exclusively shared by all Mlabri
individuals with 100 percent membership fractions and
this pattern persisted for all choices of K>3. Similar
analyses were also performed using the program frappe
[14] which implements a maximum likelihood method.
The results obtained from frappe (Figure 6B) showed a
general concordance with that of STRUCTURE; but
slight differences were also observed, such as the order
with which new clusters emerge at K = 5 and K = 6,
and the estimated individual membership fractions for
all K>3. Notably, both analyses showed that all Asian
populations shared some proportion of the major
Mlabri component at K = 4 and K = 5. However, this

sharing pattern, unless it is an artifact, is more likely to
be explained by shared common ancestry rather than
recent gene flow, because it appears highly unlikely
that the Mlabri received (or contributed) nearly identical amounts of gene flow from (or to) all Asian populations, and with similar proportions, in every instance.
Therefore, the close relationship between Mlabri and
Htin is most likely the result of a considerable degree
of common ancestry.

Population- and component-based clustering analyses

Because the analyses discussed above were all consistent
in showing that individuals from the same population
cluster together, it is meaningful to evaluate the genetic
relationships among populations. A maximum likelihood
tree of populations [15], based on 55,561 SNPs showed
that Mlabri (MA) and Htin (TN) have the closest relationship, and this topology was supported by 100% of
bootstrap replicates (Figure 7A).

K is based on the highest probability run of ten runs at that K.

However, the Htin showed signs of admixture in both
STRUCTURE and frappe analyses (Figure 6A, B). This
raised the concern that whether the close relationship
between Mlabri and Htin was confounded by external
immigrants from other populations, given that about
half of components of Htin are also found in both Austro-Asiatic and Tai-Kadai populations at Ks>4 in

STRUCTURE results (Figure 6A). We thus further
investigated this potential confounding effect by reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of those clusters
inferred from STRUCTURE and frappe (referred to as
the “component tree”). The rationale is that the component tree, given the statistical independence of the components, should reveal an evolutionary history that is

Xu et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/18

less perturbed by recent gene flow and admixture than
is a population phylogeny. At K = 8, both STRUCTURE
and frappe identified a cluster predominant in the Htin,
and with each of the other seven clusters easily associated with a predominant linguistic or ethnic group.
We therefore refer to the eight clusters (or components)
by their representative linguistic or ethnic group as

component tree was reconstructed based on allele frequencies in each cluster inferred from the STRUCTURE
analysis (Figure 7B). We found that the Mlabri specific
and Htin specific component clustered tightly on the
tree (supported by 100% of bootstrap replicates),

strongly indicating once again that the Mlabri share a
more recent ancestry with the Htin than with any other
group in our sample.

Discussion
In this study, we analyzed genome-wide SNP data on
the Mlabri, as well as several neighboring populations
and HapMap population samples. The Mlabri population shows several substantial differences from the other
populations: significantly increased LD, extremely
reduced haplotype diversity and small effective population size (29), all of which are consistent with the view
that the Mlabri were recently founded from a very small
number of individuals of an agricultural group but subsequently adopted their current hunting-gathering lifestyle, as proposed by a recent study based primarily on
mtDNA and Y chromosome data [7]. Although an alternative scenario could also explain the above genetic
characteristics of Mlabri, i.e. the Mlabri are an ancient
hunter-gatherer group and maintain their hunting-gathering lifestyle from the very beginning but experienced a
severe bottleneck event in the history, the results from
the clustering analyses do not favor this scenario. If the
Mlabri are an ancient hunter-gatherer group, we expect
Mlabri is outside of the clade of all Asian populations
and close to the root of Asian clade, but Mlabri is actually inside of Asian clade with Austro-Asiatic group outside on both population tree (Figure 7A) and
component trees (Figure 7B, C) where no signal of
admixture was found have disturbed tree topology.
Both model-free and model-based clustering analyses
strongly suggest that the Mlabri share a degree of

common ancestry with the Htin, a group speaking Tin
language. In this case – as is the general rule in many
human populations – the genetic affinity of these populations is consistent with its linguistic affinity. This result,
to our knowledge, is the first genetic evidence supporting
the linguistic affinity of the Mlabri and Tin languages.
Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues showed an apparent congruence between linguistic phyla and genetic clusters,
and they proposed that this congruence indicates “considerable parallelism between genetic and linguistic evolution” [16]. Subsequent studies using diverse scales and
methodologies have found variable degrees of association
between linguistic and genetic classifications [17-22].
Some typical examples of exceptions are populations
with language replacement [23-26] or recent admixture
between divergent populations [27,28]. However, human
genetic and linguistic diversity have been proposed to be
generally correlated, either through a direct link, whereby
linguistic and genetic affiliations reflect the same past
population processes, or an indirect one, where the evolution of the two types of diversity is independent but
conditioned by the same geographic factors [29].
Hunting and gathering was presumably the subsistence strategy employed by human societies for more
than two million years, until the end of the Mesolithic
period. Contemporary hunter-gatherer groups are often
thought to serve as models of an ancient lifestyle that
was typical of human populations prior to the development of agriculture. However, there has been complex
interaction between hunter-gatherers and non-huntergatherers for millennia. There are contemporary huntergatherer peoples who, after contact with other societies,
continue their ways of life with very little external influence. There are also contemporary groups usually identified as hunter-gatherers do not have a continuous
history of hunting and gathering, and in many cases
their ancestors were agriculturalists and/or pastoralists
who were pushed into marginal areas as a result of
migrations, economic exploitation, and/or violent conflict [30]. Our current data are not sufficient to distinguish the two scenarios, but in case cultural reversion
occurred in the history of Mlabri, the Htin is most likely
the source population from which the Mlabri genetically
originated. The Htin samples in this study speak Mal
language, represent only one of the two varieties (Mal
and Prai) of Tin language [31,32], it is possible to
further determine which variety the Mlabri language originated from by comparing the genetic relationships
between the Mlabri and populations speak the two Tin
varieties, although such evidence is indirect and would
only make sense when the assumption hold that the
genetic origin of the Mlabri was not earlier than the
divergence of the two language varieties and there was
no language replacement.

Conclusions
In summary, our results strongly suggested that the
Mlabri share more recent common ancestry with the
Htin, a group speaking a Tin language. This result, to
our knowledge, is the first genetic evidence supporting
the linguistic affinity of the Mlabri and Tin languages.
We proposed that Htin is most likely the source population from which the Mlabri genetically originated in
case cultural reversion occurred in the history of Mlabri.
Methods
Populations and Samples

Samples from the Mlabri as well as other 12 populations
were collected in Thailand. The sample information,
including sample size, ethnic and linguistic information
is shown in Table 1, and the sampling locations are
shown in Additional file 3, Figure S3. These samples
were also described previously [33]. In this study, eight
Mlabri samples were not included because they were
identified as close relatives (IBD > 0.2) of one of the rest
samples. Four population samples (60 YRI, Yoruba from
Ibadan, Nigeria; 60 CEU, Utah residents with ancestry
from northern and western Europe; 45 CHB, Han Chinese in Beijing; and 44 JPT, Japanese in Tokyo) obtained
from the database of the International HapMap Project
[34] were also included in this study.
Data Sets

Genotype data of 13 Thailand population samples generated using Affymetrix Genechip Human Mapping 50K
Xba array were obtained from the Pan-Asian SNP Initiative [33]. Detailed information about data filtration and
data quality control was described elsewhere [33]. Genotypes of 60 YRI, 60 CEU, 45 CHB and 44 JPT samples
were obtained from the International HapMap Project
[34-36] (HapMap public released #23a, 2008-04-01).
Most of the analyses in this study used the markers that
genotyped in both PanAsia project and HapMap project,
including 55,561 autosomal SNPs shared by 13 Thailand
population samples and 4 HapMap population samples.

Page 10 of 13

shared by 17 populations, and only unrelated individuals
were included.
SNP heterozygosity

Heterozygosity for each SNP (HSe) was calculated based
on allele frequencies.
Haplotype heterozygosity

To calculate heterozygosity for haplotypes (HHe), the genome was divided into 500-kb regions, with each region
having roughly 14 SNPs. HHe were calculated for each
region using haplotype frequencies [38]. Considering the
substantial variation of recombination across human genome [39,40], we adopted a slide window strategy and let
the sliding window move 100 kb each time. For each
population, HHe were averaged over all windows.
Number of haplotypes and its cumulative proportion
of the genome

The number of haplotypes was obtained by counting the
number of haplotypes for a given window size, i.e. 500kb or 1-Mb, respectively, for each population. The same
sliding-window scheme as mentioned before was
employed. Since this measurement could be affected by
sample size, we sampled 36 chromosomes (equal to the
sample size of Mlabri) without replacement in each
population. Note that Mlabri has the smallest sample
size in all the populations studied. For a population with
sample size larger than 36 chromosomes, the sampling
was repeated 100 times for each segment and the average of the number of haplotypes of all replications was
taken as the number of haplotypes.
The cumulative proportion given a number of haplotypes was obtained by estimating the proportion of the
sliding-windows across the genome carrying equal or
less haplotypes.
LD calculation

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs were measured using r2 following Hill and Weir [41] and calculated from haplotype data.
Principal component analysis for individuals

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed at
individual level using EIGENSOFT version 2.0 [42].
Genetic distance for individuals

Statistical analysis
Haplotype inference

Haplotypes of 22 autosomes were inferred for each individual from its genotypes with fastPHASE [37] version
1.2. “Population labels” were applied during the model
fitting procedure to enhance accuracy. The number of
haplotype clusters was set to 20, the number of random
starts of the EM algorithm (-T) was set to 20, and the
number of iterations of EM algorithm (-C) was set to
50. This analysis was used to generate a “best guess”
estimate of the true underlying patterns of haplotype
structure [37]. We run fastPHASE for 55,561 SNPs

We used an allele sharing distance (ASD) [9,43] as a measure of genetic distance between individuals and a 454 ×
454 inter-individual genetic distance matrix was generated
according to genotypes of 55,561 autosomal SNPs.
Tree reconstruction

The tree of individuals was reconstructed based on ASD
distance and using Neighbor-Joining algorithm [10] with
the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software
package (MEGA version 4.0) [44]. Trees of populations
as well as components were reconstructed using maximum likelihood method [15] with CONTML program
in PHYLIP package [45].

STRUCTURE analysis

Ancestry of each person was inferred using a Bayesian
cluster analysis as implemented in the STRUCTURE
program [12,46]. We ran STRUCTURE from K = 2 to
K = 18 and repeated 10 times for each single K. All
STRUCTURE runs used 20,000 iterations after a burnin of length 30,000, with the admixture model and
assuming that allele frequencies were correlated [46].
frappe analysis

The program frappe [14] implements a maximum likelihood method to infer genetic ancestry of each individual. As in STRUCTURE analysis, this analysis
considers each person’s genome as having originated
from K ancestral, but unobserved, populations whose
contributions are described by K coefficients that sum
to 1 for each individual [13]. The program was run for
10,000 iterations from K = 2 to 18 and repeated 10
times for each single K.
