Abstract
The prevalence of spotted fever group rickettsial infection in dogs from a remote indigenous community in the
Northern Territory (NT) was determined using molecular tools. Blood samples collected from 130 dogs in the
community of Maningrida were subjected to a spotted fever group (SFG)-specific PCR targeting the ompB gene
followed by a Rickettsia felis-specific PCR targeting the gltA gene of R. felis. Rickettsia felis ompB and gltA genes
were amplified from the blood of 3 dogs. This study is the first report of R. felis infection in indigenous community
dogs in NT.
Introduction
Rickettsioses are important emerging vector-borne diseases in humans [1], and some have been reported to
infect dogs [2,3]. Rickettsioses that are purported to be
endemic in Australia include murine typhus (Rickettsia
typhi), Queensland tick typhus (Rickettsia australis), Flinders Island spotted fever (Rickettsia honei), scrub typhus
(Orientia tsutsugamushi) and Q fever (Coxiella burnetti).
Cat flea typhus or flea-borne spotted fever, caused by Ricketsia felis, which was first described in humans in the USA
[4], is an emerging zoonosis that has been reported from
throughout the world and was recently reported in a cluster of family members in Victoria, Australia [5].
The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, is a reservoir and biological vector of R. felis [6]. In Australia, R. felis DNA was
first identified in fleas in 2006 [7]. Very recently, a molecular study in Australia detected R. felis in 9% of 100 tested
Southeast Queensland (SE QLD) pound dogs, suggesting
that dogs may act as mammalian reservoir hosts for
R. felis [8]. Given the close bond that exists between
humans and canines, it is possible that dogs may be a
potential source of R. felis infection for humans. Dogs are
also important in indigenous community life, and it is
therefore prudent to better understand the public health
risks that may be associated with the human-animal bond
in these communities. To this end, we sought to investigate the prevalence of spotted-fever group organisms in

dogs from the indigenous community of Maningrida in
the Northern Territory (NT), using PCR assays.

Materials and methods
Blood samples were collected from 130 dogs undergoing
sterilisation facilitated by the Animal Management in
Rural and Remote Indigenous Communities (AMRRIC)
organisation in the indigenous community of Maningrida,
NT. Sixty of these dogs were tested in September 2009
and 70 in September 2010. The sampled cohort of dogs
was represented by 56 entire males and 69 entire females.
Data on gender were unavailable for 5 dogs. One mL of
whole blood was obtained from each dog by venipuncture,
and the blood was immediately transferred to a QIAcard
FTA® Four Spots (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to facilitate
preservation of DNA during transport.
DNA extraction from blood applied to FTA cards was
carried out using the MasterPure™ DNA purification kit
(Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, USA), following the
protocol described by Abd Rani et al. [9].
All extracted DNA was subjected to a previously
described PCR assay which amplifies a portion of the
ompB gene in SFG rickettsiae [10]. DNA extracted from a
Rickettsia conorii culture obtained from the Australian
Rickettsial Reference Laboratory was used as a positive
control, whilst nuclease- free water (NFW) was used as a
negative control. Blood samples found to be positive for
SFG rickettsial DNA were further subjected to a speciesspecific nested PCR for R. felis, which amplified the gltA
gene (Table 1). Rickettsia felis specific primers were
designed by aligning gltA sequences retrieved from

determined all three SFG positive dogs to harbour R.
felis DNA. Sequences were 100% homologous to the R.
felis gltA gene [GenBank: CP000053].

Product size

GenBank of closely related rickettsial species (R. felis,
[GenBank: CP000053]; R. australis, [GenBank: U59718];
Rickettsia_rickettsii, [GenBank: U59729]; R. typhi, [GenBank: U59714]) using CLUSTALW program http://www.
genome.jp/tools/clustalw/. Nested PCR primers were
manually designed by selecting a region specific to R. felis
(Table 1). However, the potential cross-reaction of this
newly designed PCR was not tested with other Rickettsia
spp. This PCR that was developed relies on confirming
diagnosis by DNA sequencing to ensure there is no cross
reactivity with closely related organisms.
Primary PCR amplification of the gltA gene of R. felis
was performed in a 25 μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl
of DNA, 5 μl 5× PCR buffer, 200 μmol/L dNTP,
2.0 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5 units of GoTaq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 10 pmol of each forward and
reverse primer made to the final volume with NFW. Two
μl of distilled water and R. felis DNA isolated from an
infected cat flea were used as negative and positive control,
respectively. PCR cycling conditions comprised an initial
activation step at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of
95°C for 45 s, 63°C for 30 s and 72°C for 45 s with a final
extension step of 72°C for 7 min. The secondary round of
PCR amplification was performed as for the primary
round except that the annealing temperature was 59°C.
All amplified PCR products of both SFG rickettsial and
R. felis-specific PCR were visualised via transillumination
on 1.6% agarose gel stained with SYBR® Safe (Invitrogen,
Eugene, USA) DNA gel stain. All PCR products of the correct size were purified using QIAquick™ PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s protocol and subjected to DNA sequencing using
both forward and reverse primers. DNA sequences were
assessed for homology with those in GenBank using the
NCBI Blast program http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi.
This project was approved by the University of
Queensland Animal Ethics Committee.

Results
Of the total 130 tested samples, three (2.3%) were SFG
rickettsial PCR-positive and DNA sequences were > 99%
homologous with R. felis ompB gene [GenBank:
GQ385243]. Subsequent R. felis-specific nested PCR

Discussion
This is the first study to report the presence of R. felis
infection in indigenous community dogs in the NT. In
Australia, R. felis was first identified in fleas collected from
dogs and cats in Western Australia in 2006 [7]. Recently,
19.8% of fleas collected from cats in Brisbane, Sydney and
Melbourne [11] and 9% of pound dogs in SE QLD in Australia were reported to harbour R. felis DNA as identified
by PCR [8]. Cat flea typhus was also reported in a cluster
of human patients in Victoria [5]. The findings of these
studies supported the presence of a peridomestic cycle
and wide geographical distribution for this pathogen in
Australia.
In the previous molecular study, the infection of R. felis
in pound dogs in SE QLD was confirmed by PCR assay
targeting only the ompB gene and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. In this study, the gltA gene of R. felis in
dogs’ blood was amplified in addition to the ompB gene by
a novel R. felis-specific nested PCR. This study strengthens
the evidence for dogs harbouring active rickettsaemias of
this emerging zoonotic pathogen, and supports the role of
dogs as important reservoir hosts. This finding was also
supported by a study reporting concurrent R. felis infections in a PCR-positive dog and its infected owners in
Spain [12].
In this study, the flea infestation in indigenous community dogs was not evaluated in terms of flea species
and burden. However, the cat flea, C. felis, is the most
common flea infesting dogs in Australia [7,13]. These
indigenous community dogs lead a semi-domesticated
life. They are mostly poorly cared for and often infested
by ectoparasites. Hence, it is likely that the dogs in this
study were infested with fleas.
The prevalence of R. felis infection in indigenous community dogs (2.3%) is lower than those reported in pound
dogs in SE QLD (9%) [8]. The transportation of blood
using FTA cards and different DNA extraction technique
may have partially affected the prevalence detected in indigenous community dogs. This is supported by studies
showing amplification of DNA extracted from whole
blood is more sensitive and reliable than filter paper-based
technologies [14,15]. It should also be noted that neither
study was particularly comprehensive with respect to sampling across different sites in each region, hence caution is
required in making detailed comparisons with respect to
prevalence. In this study, all dogs also appeared physically
healthy, a common feature that is usually a characteristic
of reservoir hosts, however further study is needed to
determine the pathogenesis and pathogenic potential of
R. felis infections in dogs.

Conclusion
This study further supports the potential role of dogs as
reservoir hosts of R. felis and suggests that this pathogen
has a wide geographical distribution in Australia.
