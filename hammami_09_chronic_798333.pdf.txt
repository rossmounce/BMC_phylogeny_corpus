Abstract
Background: Garlic or Allium sativum (As) shows therapeutic effects such as reduction of blood
pressure or hypercholesterolemia but side-effects on reproductive functions remain poorly
investigated. Because of garlic's chemical complexity, the processing methods and yield in
preparations differ in efficacy and safety. In this context, we clarify the mechanisms of action of
crushed crude garlic on testicular markers.
Methods: During one month of treatment, 24 male rats were fed 5%, 10% and 15% crude garlic.
Results: We showed that crude garlic-feeding induced apoptosis in testicular germ cells
(spermatocytes and spermatids). This cell death process was characterized by increased levels of
active CASP3 but not CASP6. Expression of the caspase inhibitors BIRC3 and BIRC2 was increased
at all doses of As while expression of XIAP and BIRC5 was unchanged. Moreover, expression of
the IAP inhibitor DIABLO was increased at doses 10% and 15% of As. The germ cell death process
induced by As might be related to a decrease in testosterone production because of the reduced
expression of steroidogenic enzymes (Star, Cyp11a, Hsd3b5 and Hsd17b). Evaluation of Sertoli
markers showed that TUBB3 and GSTA2 expression was unchanged. In contrast, AMH, RHOX5
and CDKN1B expression was decreased while GATA4 expression was increased.
Conclusion: In summary, we showed that feeding with crude garlic inhibited Leydig steroidogenic
enzyme expression and Sertoli cell markers. These alterations might induce apoptosis in testicular
germ cells.

Background
Allium sativum (As) or garlic is a popular spice usually
eaten both raw and cooked in various doses and its potential medical properties have been recognized for thou-

sands of years [1,2]. Garlic is one of the ten commonest
herbal medicines used in the United States (ranked in fifth
place), according to recent sales data (for a review see,
[3]). Indeed, As displays therapeutic effects such as in the

treatment of hypercholesterolemia [4,5], prevention of
arteriosclerosis [6,7] and some cancers [8,9], and presents
anticoagulant [10,11] and antihypertensive [12] properties. For example, non-pharmacological treatment with
garlic preparation is suggested to reduce blood pressure in
hypertensive individuals (for a review, see [13]). The sideeffects, particularly on male reproduction, of such a
chronic treatment are poorly investigated. To date, it has
been reported that heated garlic juice was effective in
recovery of testicular function after experimental testicular
hypogonadism [14] but other laboratories have reported
that powder [15] or crude [16] garlic preparations
impaired testicular and male reproductive tract functions.
Moreover, garlic metabolites such as diallyl trisulfide have
been reported to have spermicidal effects [17,18]. The
mechanisms of garlic action on male reproduction function, and particularly on spermatogenesis, however,
remain unknown.
In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of
action of chronic consumption of crude garlic on testicular functions. We tried to identify the cellular and molecular targets of crude garlic administrated in various doses
to adult male rats.
The last step of apoptosis, before the irreversible cleavage
of crucial proteins and endonuclease activation, is under
the control of effector caspases named Caspase 3, 6 or 7.
Caspase 3 (CASP3) has been studied extensively and is
known to be synthesized as a pro-enzyme which needs
cleavage to be active [for a review, see [19]). Activation
and/or activity of CASP3, 7 or 9 is regulated by the Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). IAPs share a common
domain known as BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat), that
binds to and inhibits CASP3, 7 or 9 [20,21]. Among the
IAP family are XIAP, BIRC3 (previously known as c-IAP1),
BIRC2 (previously known as c-IAP2) and BIRC5 (previously known as Survivin) [22]. A third level of regulation
has also been observed. IAP action can be inhibited by
mitochondrial proteins such as DIABLO [23-25]. Therefore, the fate of the cell at the executioner step of apoptosis
depends on the relative quantity of each actor: effector
caspase; IAPs and IAP inhibitors, such as DIABLO. In
addition to the caspase pathway, the AIFM1 (Apoptosisinducing factor mitochondrion-associated 1) exists,
which is a phylogenetically ancient mitochondrial intermembrane flavoprotein endowed with the unique capacity to induce caspase-independent peripheral chromatin
condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation when
added to purified nuclei [26].

Plant preparation
The type of As used in the present study was "spring garlic". It has pink bulbs and is planted between December
and March (according to the weather) in Tunisia and collected in July. This type of garlic contains 2.1% of proteins, 30% of carbohydrates, 1.5% of fibres, 0.2% of fat,
0.015% of vitamins and 0.7% minerals. The As plant used
in this study was grown in Tunisia and purchased from a
local market. Every day the garlic pellets were made by
mixing peeled cloves of garlic with powdered standard rat
pellet diet (Industrial Society of Food, Sfax, Tunisia) at
three doses: 5%, 10% and 15%. For example, 15% pellets
for one rat were prepared by mixing 4.5 g of crude garlic
with 25.5 g of powdered standard diet in 5 mL of water.

Cloves were crushed in distilled water in order to minimize volatile compound loss. A similar volume of water
was added to the other doses [16].
Animal treatments
A total of 24 adult male rats of Wistar strain were used for
the study as previously described [16]. Control animals
received standard pellet diet (0%). The other groups
received diet supplemented with 5%, 10% and 15% of As.
Every day, 30 g of food (garlic mixed with standard diet)
was given to each rat. After 30 days of treatment the rats
were sacrificed by decapitation. Testes were weighed and
dissected. For each animal, the first testis was fixed in formaldehyde followed by routine paraffin embedding for
TUNEL and immunohistochemical analysis; the second
testis was frozen at -80°C for molecular and Western blot
analyses. All studies on animals were conducted in
accordance with current regulation and standards
approved by the Faculty of Medicine of Tunis Animal Care
Committee.
Study design
In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic
consumption of crude garlic on testicular markers. First,
apoptosis through TUNEL and CASP3 immunostaining
approach was analyzed. In the following experiments, we
have examined how treatment with As could induce
changes in the expression of effector CASP3 and 6, of their
cellular inhibitors (XIAP, BIRC2, BIRC3 and BIRC5) and
mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors (DIABLO and
AIFM1). Since germ cell apoptosis might be linked to
impairment of gonadotropin delivery and/or Leydig or
Sertoli cell dysfunction, we have further evaluated these
aspects.
TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-X Nick End Labeling)
Paraffin sections (5 μm) of formaldehyde-fixed testicular
tissues were mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides. The sections were handled as previously described [27]. For each
rat testis at least 100 random seminiferous tubules were
numbered. The results were expressed as the apoptotic
rate, i.e. the number of TUNEL positive cells per number
of Sertoli cells.
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin sections were incubated for 20 min at 93°–98°C
in citric buffer (0.01 M, pH 6) and left to cool for 20 min
at room temperature. The sections were rinsed twice for 5
min in osmosed water, and washed twice for 5 min in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20. The
Envision+ kit was used for detection of anti-cleaved CASP3
antibody (dilution 1/50) according to the manufacturer's
recommendations. The antigen-antibody complexes were
stained with DAB which generated a brown color at the
site of peroxidase activity. The sections were rinsed twice

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/65

for 5 min in osmosed water, counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 min and mounted in Faramount®.
RNA extraction and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) coamplification
Total RNA were extracted from testicular tissues with TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amount of RNA was estimated by
spectrophotometry at 260 nm. The cDNAs were obtained
by reverse transcription of 5 μg of total RNAs using random hexanucleotides as primers (5 μM) in the presence of
dNTP (200 μM), dithiothreitol (10 mM) and M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (200 U/μl) for 1 h at 37°C. For the
PCR analysis, the target genes Star (Steroidogenesis activator protein), Cyp11a1 (previously known as P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage), Hsd3b5 (previously known as
3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), Hsd17b3 (17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), Cyp19a1 (previously known as P450 aromatase) and Srd5a2 (previously
known as 5alpha-reductase) were coamplified with the
standard housekeeping gene Actb (beta-actin), in the presence of 2 μl of cDNA mixture, 0.02 U/μl of Taq polymerase, 1 μM of target primers, 0.5 to 1 μM Actb primers, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 100 μM dNTPs and 0.075 μl of [α-33P] dATP.
The PCR amplification was performed by first heating the
mixture at 95°C for 5 min followed by several cycles (see
Table 1) consisting of three steps: one at 95°C for 30 sec,
a step at melting temperature (Tm, see Table 1) for 30 sec
and a step at 72°C for 30 sec. The PCR reaction ended
with a step at 72°C for 5 min. After amplification, the
coamplified PCR products for the target and the standard
genes were separated onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel. The
gel was dried and exposed on a phosphor screen (Packard,
Meriden, CT) for about 30 min to 1 h. The phosphor
screen was scanned by a cyclone phosphorimager (Packard, Meriden, CT) and the band intensities for each PCR
product were quantified with OptiQuant software (Packard, Meriden, CT). The data were expressed as a target
gene/Actb mRNA ratio. The sequences for the primers are
reported in Table 1. The PCR reactions were conducted
within the logarithmic phase of amplification. The PCRamplified products were checked by direct sequencing.
The RT-PCR primers were designed inside separate exons
to avoid any bias caused by residual genomic contamination. Moreover, for all primers, no amplification was
observed when PCR was performed on RNA preparations.
Western blotting analyses
Proteins were obtained from testicular tissues as previously described [16]. Proteins (15 – 40 μg) were resolved
on a 10%–15% sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide
gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane using 25 mM Tris -185 mM glycine buffer (pH 8.3) containing 20% methanol at a constant voltage of 100 V for 1 h. After transfer, the

membranes were incubated in a blocking buffer (TBS containing 1% of BSA and 0.1% Tween-20) for 2 h at room
temperature. The membranes were rinsed three times with
TBS/0.1%Tween-20 for 10 min each, and incubated with
the first antibody (in TBS containing 1% of BSA) overnight at 4°C. The antibodies were diluted as follows: 1/
100 for GATA-4 and AMH; 1/200 for RHOX5 and CASP3;
1/400 for BIRC3 and BIRC5; 1/500 for CDKN1B; 1/600
for DIABLO; 1/1,000 for CASP6 and GSTA2; 1/2,500 for
BIRC2; 1/3,000 for TUBB3 and 1/6,000 for XIAP. The protein loading was checked by probing the blot with a rabbit
IgG anti-ACTIN antibody (1/20,000). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected with a chemiluminescent
kit. The membranes were exposed on Biomax MR films.
The intensity of the bands was determined with OptiQuant software. The data were expressed as a target/actin
protein ratio.
Data analysis
The results are expressed as the mean ± SD. For each condition, at least six different rats were used. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for independent groups was
performed to determine whether there were differences
between all groups and this was followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test at p < 0.05 to determine the significance
(p < 0.05) of the differences between the pair of groups.
The statistical tests were performed on StatView software
version 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Results
Effects of As treatment on germ cell apoptosis
Treatment with As induced a cell death process in the
adult rat testis as shown by the TUNEL approach. In the
control untreated animals, very few apoptotic germ cells
were observed (Fig. 1A), whereas TUNEL-positive cells
were identified in rat testis treated with 15% of As (Fig.

according to target gene

146

1B). These TUNEL-positive cells were mainly spermatocytes and spermatids (Fig. 1B). The number of apoptotic
germ cells in rat testes increased after treatment with As in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). A significant (p <
0.0001) increase was observed in the rats treated with
10% and 15% of As. The cell death process induced in
spermatocytes and spermatids from rats fed with As was
probably an apoptotic mechanism, since an immunostaining for cleaved CASP3 was detected in these cells (Fig.
1D) while only a few stained germ cells were detected in
untreated rats (Fig. 1C).
Effects of As feeding on the executioner step of apoptosis
in the adult rat testis
Cleaved CASP3 expression was increased in a dosedependent manner in the testicular tissues from rats fed
with As with a significant increase at doses 10% (26%, p =
0.0003) and 15% (29%, p < 0.0001; Fig. 2B). In contrast,
As-feeding did not modify the expression of cleaved
CASP6 (Fig. 2C). The BIRC3 protein levels were significantly increased at doses 5% (30.5%; p < 0.01), 10%
(29%; p < 0.02) and 15% (36%; p < 0.003) of As (Fig. 3A).
Similarly, the BIRC2 protein levels were significantly
increased after treatment with 5% (29%; p < 0.002), 10%
(31.5%; p < 0.004) and 15% (37%; p < 0.0003) of As (Fig.
3B). In contrast, As-feeding did not modify the protein
levels of XIAP (Fig. 3C) or BIRC5 (Fig. 3D) at the different
tested doses. We then evaluated the third partner of the
executioner step of apoptosis, i.e. the IAP inhibitor DIABLO. Its protein levels were increased significantly at
doses 10% (21%; p < 0.02) and 15% (21.5%; p < 0.02)
(Fig. 3E). The apoptotic cell death process can also be
induced by a caspase-independent pathway represented
by AIFM1. In the testicular tissue from rats fed with As, the
expression of active AIFM1 protein (Fig. 3F) levels was
unchanged at the different tested doses.

CASP3 immunostaining (C, D) (magnification = ×200). Red staining reveals the TUNEL positive nuclei and brown staining
reveals the CASP3 cytoplasm immunostaining.

Effects of treatment with As on plasma hormone levels
In a previous report, we showed that As significantly
decreased plasma and intratesticular testosterone levels,
while a significant increase in LH levels was observed, but
the FSH was not investigated [16]. We show here that FSH
plasma levels were significantly decreased (about 19.7%)
at doses 10% (without As 12.7 ± 1.91 ng/mL; vs. with
10% As 10.22 ± 1.6 ng/mL; p = 0.03) and 15% (10.18 ±
1.17 ng/mL; p = 0.04) of As.

Effects of treatment with As on Leydig cell steroidogenic
enzyme expression
The mRNA levels for Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b5 and Hsb17b3
were decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). The
Star mRNA levels were significantly decreased (Fig. 4A) in
testicular tissue from rats treated with 5% (16%; p = 0.02),
10% (64.5%; p < 0.0001) and 15% (66%; p < 0.0001) of
As. Similarly, Cyp11a1 (p < 0.0001, Fig. 4B) and Hsd3b5
(p < 0.0001, Fig. 4C) mRNA levels were significantly
decreased at the different doses of crude garlic tested. The
Hsb17b3 mRNA levels were significantly decreased at
doses 5% (25%; p < 0.004), 10% (37%; p < 0.002) and

Discussion
Effects of As on Sertoli cell markers
Some Sertoli markers such as GATA-4, GSTA2, TUBB3,
AMH, RHOX5 and CDKN1B were evaluated (Fig. 5).
Expression of GATA-4 protein levels was significantly (p <
0.0001) increased at 10% and 15% doses of crude garlic
(Fig. 5A). In contrast, GSTA2 (Fig. 5B), TUBB3 (Fig. 5C) or
RHOX5 (Fig. 5E) expression was unchanged at different
doses of As tested. The expression of AMH protein levels
was significantly decreased after treatment with 10%
(19.3%; p = 0.007) and 15% (24.1%; p = 0.001) of As (Fig.

Garlic has acquired a reputation as a formidable prophylactic and therapeutic medicinal agent over the centuries
and many favorable experimental and clinical effects of
the consumption of garlic, in different types of preparations (crude, powder...) have been reported (including
cardiovascular diseases, stimulation of immune function,
detoxification properties... for a review, see [3]). It has
long been known, however, that the extraction process
can increase potency compared with the crude plant. In
the present study, the chemical analysis of the crude garlic
used was not achieved, but Shukla and colleagues have

quantified the concentration of the different compounds
of garlic [9]. In this context, administration of garlic preparation to prevent hypercholesterolemia or arteriosclerosis might have side-effects on other organs. In terms of
testicular functions, garlic or its metabolites have been
studied as a protective adjuvant to different types of toxins
[28]. Indeed, induction of testicular hypogonadism by
heat is prevented in part by different types of garlic preparation (raw, heated garlic juices, dehydrated garlic powder
of the more potent aged garlic extract [14]. Aqueous
extract of garlic [29] or the metabolites diallyl sulfide [30]
and diallyl tetrasulfide [31] offer a protection against cadmium-induced testicular damages. Garlic is also effective
in restoring the testicular histology altered by EDTA [32].
The antioxidant activities of garlic extract were shown to
decrease the toxic effects of free radicals induced by testicular torsion and detorsion [33]. While several studies
show that As has a protective effect as an adjuvant, other
studies show that it modifies spermatogenesis. Indeed,
daily administration of 50 mg garlic powder over 70 days
induced a spermatogenetic arrest at spermatocyte I stage
[15]. Moreover, aqueous garlic extract [17] or the metabolite diallyl trisulfide [18] have spermaticidal effects. In
contrast, a 90-day administration of 100 mg/kg aqueous
extract of garlic has been shown to increase the number of
spermatozoa [34]. In this context, to assess the positive or
negative effect of garlic, it was important to analyze its
action on the different testicular functions through the
study of germ cell apoptosis, Leydig cell steroidogenesis
and Sertoli cell markers (the present study). The present
study has focused on the effects of As on testicular cells
and its mechanisms of action. We showed here that oral
administration of crude garlic induced germ cell death
that targeted spermatocytes and spermatids, whereas spermatogonia and somatic Leydig and Sertoli cells were not
affected. Given that CASP3 was immunodetected mainly
in spermatocyte and spermatid cells (the TUNEL-positive
germ cells) and that As treatment, at the same doses as
observed for TUNEL, induced a dose-dependent increase
in active CASP3 protein levels, the possibility exists that
the germ cell apoptotic process could be related to CASP3
activation. The germ cell death might also, however, be
related to another programmed cell death process since
CASP3 activation has been associated with differentiation
in some cell types [35]. In contrast, the active effector
CASP6 seemed not to be involved in our model, while
proCASP6 is expressed in normal germ cells [36]. While it
was previously reported that chronic administration of 50
mg of garlic powder induced an arrest of spermatogenesis,
our present study shows, for the first time, the involvement of an apoptotic process that targets testicular germ
cells. Very few, if any, studies have reported such an apoptotic effect of As on non-tumoral cells, although it has
been described in tumoral cells [37]. For example, administration of crude extract of garlic to a human colon cancer

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/65

cell line induced apoptosis by increasing the levels of BAX,
CYCS (previously known as cytochrome c) and CASP3
activity while it decreased the mitochondrial membrane
potential [38]. More specifically, raw crushed garlic is high
in allicin, a powerful bioactive compound of garlic that
induced activation of CASP3, CASP8 and CASP9 and
cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in several cancer cells [39].
Given that the balance between pro-apoptotic molecules
(active effector caspase, IAPs inhibitors) and anti-apoptotic molecules (IAPs) levels determines the fate of the
cells towards the executioner step of the death process
[21], we have evaluated the expression of IAPs in our
experimental model. BIRC2 and BIRC3 are highly
expressed in rat testes [40]. BIRC3 was detected in the
nucleus of B spermatogonia, spermatocytes at different
stages and of somatic cells while BIRC2 was localized in
the cytoplasmic compartment of spermatocytes (from
stage VI pachytene onwards), spermatids (round and
elongated) and Leydig cells [41]. While BIRC2 and BIRC3
play a role in the protection of germ cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis [41], their increased expression after treatment with crude garlic (the present study) suggested that
germ cells are unable to inhibit CASP3 action. A potential
explanation is that the high levels of DIABLO (in spermatocytes) or HTRA2 in spermatids by inhibiting the IAP
action may favor the activity of CASP3 in the germ cells
mainly affected by apoptosis after As treatment. The other
IAPs studied here were expressed for BIRC5 in spermatocytes at first meiotic prophase and highly in Leydig cells
[42] or exclusively in Leydig cells (our unpublished data)
and for XIAP mainly in Sertoli cells (our unpublished
data). BIRC5 and XIAP levels were unchanged after As
treatment, suggesting that Leydig (BIRC5) and Sertoli
(XIAP) cells are not affected in terms of apoptosis by crude
garlic administration. These data are in accordance with
the TUNEL approach used in the present study.
DNA degradation might also be triggered by a caspaseindependent pathway through the action of AIFM1. During the apoptotic process, AIFM1 is released from mitochondria and translocated into the nucleus where its DNA
binding activity mediates large-scale DNA fragmentation
[26,43]. Given that As treatment, at the doses used in the
present study, had no effect on the expression of active
AIFM1, we suggest that the caspase-dependent pathway is
mainly involved in our experimental model. The next
question to address was whether germ cell death induced
by As was related to modifications in hormone profile
and/or Leydig and/or Sertoli cell markers.
Crude garlic induced a dose-dependent decrease in
plasma and intratesticular testosterone concentrations in
treated rats and an increase in LH levels [16], suggesting

Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2009, 7:65

that As targeted Leydig cells. In this context, we evaluated
the different steps of testosterone biosynthesis. Conversion of cholesterol to biologically active testosterone is a
multi-step enzymatic process, including Star, that controls
the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner
mitochondrial membrane [44], Cyp11a1, Hsd17b3 and
Hsd3b5. Testosterone can be metabolized by Srd5a2 or
Cyp19a1. We showed here that As alters testosterone production, since we found that Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd17b3 and
Hsd3b5 mRNA levels were decreased in a dose-dependent
manner. Given that testosterone protects germ cells, especially spermatocytes and spermatids, against apoptosis
[45-47], its decrease induced by As treatment might be an
explanation for the death of spermatocyte and spermatid
cells via an apoptotic process. Interestingly, while garlic
extract is known to reduce serum cholesterol levels (in
humans and animals) and inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis [48] testosterone production was not related to cholesterol metabolism [16] but to steroidogenic enzyme
modification (the present study).
In terms of Sertoli cells, we showed here that both hormones which regulate cellular functions are decreased, i.e.
testosterone and plasma FSH levels. In addition, the germ
cell number might be decreased since the number of
empty seminiferous tubules increased in a dose-dependent manner [16] and it is well recognized that germ cell
loss modifies Sertoli cell functions (for a review, see [49]).
In this context, we evaluated several Sertoli cell markers
such as TUBB3, a housekeeping gene involved in
cytosqueleton network [50] and expressed exclusively in
Sertoli cells (our unpublished data), or proteins known to
be regulated by testosterone (GSTA2, RHOX5, AMH,
CDKN1B) and FSH (AMH) or known to be involved in
paracrine interactions (GATA4). TUBB3 expression was
unchanged at all doses of As used, suggesting an absence
of effect of crude garlic on Sertoli cell number (the present
study). These data are in accordance with the absence of
apoptosis in Sertoli cells discussed above. In terms of
androgen-dependent genes, we showed here that two of
them (GSTA2 and RHOX5) have their expression
unchanged after treatment. In contrast, AMH and
CDKN1B expression was decreased while GATA-4 protein
expression was significantly increased after feeding with
crude garlic (the present study). Given that RHOX5 and
GSTA2 expression (genes that possess ARE or ARE-like
sequences) was unchanged, the possibility exists that As
effects on AMH and CDKN1B are not linked to testosterone modifications but rather linked to germ cell loss. Altogether, these data indicate that As modifies some Sertoli
cell markers. In the present experimental model, we
observed decreased levels of testosterone associated with
decreased levels of FSH. As suggested, the decreased
plasma FSH levels could not be accounted for a central
alteration since LH plasma levels were increased. It is

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/65

noteworthy that the increase in plasma LH levels observed
here was higher (about double at 10% As and 3.3-fold at
15% As) than the decrease observed in FSH plasma levels
(1.2-fold at 10 and 15% As). Two hypotheses, however,
might explain the discrepancies observed in the plasma
gonadotropin levels. First, increased estradiol production
has been shown to be associated with decreased plasma
FSH without effects on LH production [51]. It is likely that
in our experimental model the estradiol production was
not modified since in the rats fed with crude garlic, the
aromatase expression was not different compared with
control animals. Second, Sertoli cells produce inhibin B
which inhibits FSH secretion. Inhibin B expression is
stimulated by FSH or germ cells (pachytene spermatocytes, early spermatids) and inhibited by testosterone. In
the present study, the possibility exists that the dramatic
decrease in testosterone production induces an increase in
inhibin production that in turn decreases FSH plasma levels.
Raw garlic consumption by humans ranges from one to
two cloves (about 4 g) to 28 g per day (for a review, see
[3]). The concentration used in the present study exceeds
this amount of consumption, but various other types of
garlic preparation are consumed (such as garlic powder,
oil, extract or aged garlic) and the concentration in garlic
active components is highly variable, particularly in powder and oil (for a review, see [3]). Moreover, the bioactive
components of garlic are not fully characterized even if it
is assumed that the sulfur-containing molecules are the
active ones. Another point is that garlic consumption to
reduce cardiovascular risk is a long-term consumption
which is another potential negative effect with regard to
spermatogenesis. In this context, and more widely, extrapolation from rat to human is a difficult task. It has long
been known, however, that human spermatogenesis is
more sensitive to stress than that of rats [52], suggesting
that concentrations lower than those used in the present
study might impair male spermatogenesis and, particularly, might induce azoospermia in men with low sperm
count.

Conclusion
In summary, we showed that feeding with crude fresh
crushed garlic has inhibitory effects on Leydig steroidogenic enzyme expression and Sertoli cell markers. These
alterations might induce germ cell death (spermatocytes
and spermatids) via an apoptotic process.
