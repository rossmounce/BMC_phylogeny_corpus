Abstract
Background: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is now endemic in most tropical
countries. In Thailand, dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever is a leading cause of hospitalization
and death among children. A longitudinal study among 1750 people in two rural and one urban sites
in northern Thailand from 2001 to 2003 studied spatial and temporal determinants for recent
dengue infection at three levels (time, individual and household).
Methods: Determinants for dengue infection were measured by questionnaire, land-cover maps
and GIS. IgM antibodies against dengue were detected by ELISA. Three-level multi-level analysis was
used to study the risk determinants of recent dengue infection.
Results: Rates of recent dengue infection varied substantially in time from 4 to 30%, peaking in
2002. Determinants for recent dengue infection differed per site. Spatial clustering was observed,
demonstrating variation in local infection patterns. Most of the variation in recent dengue infection
was explained at the time-period level. Location of a person and the environment around the house
(including irrigated fields and orchards) were important determinants for recent dengue infection.
Conclusion: We showed the focal nature of asymptomatic dengue infections. The great variation
of determinants for recent dengue infection in space and time should be taken into account when
designing local dengue control programs.

Introduction
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection, now endemic
in most tropical countries, and a major public health con-

cern [1]. The reasons for the global resurgence of epidemic
dengue fever are not fully understood but are related to
demographic and societal changes, including increased

population movements. In Thailand, dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever has been classified a leading cause
of hospitalization and death among children [1]. Epidemics of dengue have been reported throughout the country,
with large outbreaks in 1987 and 1998 [2,3], and are
spreading from Bangkok [4].
Dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The
container-breeding Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (=Stegomyia
aegypti of [6], see below) became important following
rapid urbanization in the 20th century [5]. Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (=St. albopictus of [6]), although having a
controversial role in dengue transmission [7], is found in
artificial and natural containers in rural and peri-urban
areas [5]. Sparse vegetation, low altitude and good transportation routes favor Ae. aegypti over Ae. albopictus [8]. As
a result of phylogenetic studies of the mosquito tribe
Aedini, Reinert et al. [6] proposed generic status for a
number of traditionally recognized subgenera of genus
Aedes, including Stegomyia. However, the traditional classification of genus Aedes, with Stegomyia as a subgenus, is
used in this paper.
Many factors have been associated with dengue transmission, including urbanization, water storage and inadequate water supply, increase in discarded containers, and
population movements [9]. Marked spatial and temporal
diversity in dengue incidence indicated the complexity of
dengue virus transmission in a school population in Thailand [10].

clinical [14]. Seropositivity can be used as a marker for
dengue infection.
The present study was undertaken to investigate personal,
household, and environmental determinants for recent
dengue infection and how these vary over space and time.
A Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to
evaluate determinants related to landscape features such
as land cover.

Methods
Study design
Three study sites with changes in land cover between 1989
and 2000 were selected based on patterns of change
observed on Landsat images and field visits (Figure 1).

• Ban Pa Nai is a rural area in Chiang Mai province with
two villages at an altitude of 450 m. The main land use
change observed is the intensification of irrigated areas,
facilitated by a dam built in 1996 and by the use of dry
season crops.
• Ban Pang is a rural site in Lamphun province at an altitude of 380 m. Surrounding a narrow irrigated valley,

Changes in dengue incidence over time and space might
also be caused by changes in land use. In Thailand, great
areas of forest have been cleared for cash crops and
orchards; rice fields have been converted into housing in
peri-urban areas, potentially increasing the area and conditions suitable for vector breeding. Only a few attempts
have been made at linking land cover or spatial features to
dengue infection since it was generally accepted that dengue transmission was restricted to urban areas and settlements rather than natural or agricultural environments
[11,12]. However, prevalence of seropositivity was
recently found to be equally high in rural and peri-urban
sites, but risk factors have been shown to vary between
rural areas and between rural and peri-urban sites [13].
Analyzing land cover and land use is also relevant because
of the links between mosquito breeding and land cover
[Vanwambeke et al., forthcoming], and people's location
in relation to these.
Since passive surveillance is used in Thailand, many infections are missed because of this large proportion of
asymptomatic infections. In a prospective cohort study in
Thailand, 87% of the dengue virus infections were sub-

large areas on the hill-slope have been cleared for planting
longan trees (fruit cash crop).
• Mae Hia is situated in the suburbs of Chiang Mai and is
composed of two villages at an altitude of 320 m. Following land speculation and development, large areas of
former rice fields were converted into housing projects or
left unused following the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
All study villages had a history of dengue infection
recorded by the local public health authorities.
Land cover maps were derived from a March 2000 Landsat
image with a spatial resolution of 30 meters using the
maximum likelihood classification method, with a global
accuracy ranging from 81% in the heterogeneous periurban Mae Hia to 86% in Ban Pang and 87% in Ban Pa
Nai. Details on image pre-processing and classification of
the image are provided in [15].
Details of the study methodology were described elsewhere [16]. Briefly, the Medical Ethical Committee of Chiang Mai University approved the study, and local
permission and collaboration were obtained. Surveys
were conducted in May and September of 2001–2003.
The latitude and longitude of main points in the village,
including street corners, were registered using a hand-held
GPS (global positioning system; Garmin GPS II). Households were located on the map along these geo-referenced
streets using preliminary hand-drawn maps. The village
maps result from a combination of several sources of
information and were cross-checked with the topographic
map. All spatial data (household maps, land cover maps)
were set to the projection of the 1/50000 topographic
map of Thailand (Royal Thai Survey Department).
All inhabitants were asked to voluntarily participate in the
study. Written informed consent was obtained. Each year
between the May and September surveys, participants
filled in a calendar registering daily where they spent most
of that day. People reported fever subjectively. Finger
prick blood was collected on filter paper during the May
and September surveys (903 TM Paper, Schleicher&Schuell, Den Bosch, the Netherlands) and airdried in the shade. Within one or two days, all filter papers
were stored in a refrigerator (4°C) until antibody detection. After reconstitution of the filter papers in phosphatebuffered saline, antibodies were detected using an antidengue IgM capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) (Focus Technologies, Cypress, CA) [17]. According to the manufacturer of the test, a ratio >1.0 is positive;
however, many samples had ratios between 1.0 and 1.3,
which were considered to be either aspecific reactions or
older dengue infections. A ratio of 1.3 or more compared
to the reference was therefore considered as seropositive.

http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/5/1/5

In primary dengue infections, the level of IgM antibodies
rises shortly after infection and they disappear in most
patients two to three months afterwards [18], making
them appropriate for studying dengue infection on a seasonal basis. Knowing the relative level of IgG and IgM
antibodies is however necessary to distinguish between
primary or secondary dengue infections. IgG antibodies
can remain present for life but, in a secondary infection,
IgM will be relatively more important [19]. Measuring
IgM therefore only allows measuring recent dengue infections. A case of dengue infection was defined as a person
being IgM-positive after being IgM-negative in the previous survey. Non-cases were defined as persons who
remained positive or negative or changed from positive to
negative in two consecutive surveys.
Potential individual risk factors were assessed by questionnaire and included demographic factors, knowledge
of dengue, location and movements during the day and
evening, housing condition factors and use of preventive
measures. The same survey methods and questionnaire
were used in each site.
Data analysis
The data presented a nested structure, where individuals
are nested within households. Individuals living in the
same household share some characteristics, like housing
and house surroundings, and are therefore more likely to
resemble each other than individuals living in different
households. This violates the assumption of independence of observation and can result in spurious significant
effects [20]. Moreover, factors at the contextual and environmental level in which the individual is embedded (i.e.
household factors) can be significant determinants [21].
Multilevel regression methods were thus chosen for the
analysis. These methods allow consideration of withingroup (household) and between-group relations and integration of household and individual-level variables [22].
Since our dependent variable is binary (individual were
infected or not), we used the logistic form of the multilevel model. The surveys provided measurements at successive time points for each individual, adding a third
level to the data [23], where surveys are nested within
individuals. The intraclass correlation (ICC) allows calculation, on an empty model, of the proportion of the total
variance explained by the grouping structure, in our case
households and individuals. Odds Ratios (OR) and their
95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Factors associated (p-value < 0.15) with recent dengue infection in univariate analysis were selected for multivariate
analysis. In multivariate analysis we tested significant (pvalue < 0.10) interactions between determinants and confounding. In the tables, variables for which the confidence
interval does not include one are significant at the 0.05

level. Variables were mostly categorical, and continuous
variables were categorized using quantiles.
Preliminary analysis of the data included several progressive steps. First, analyses of recent dengue infection on
individual and household data were conducted survey by
survey. Then, two-level multilevel analyses combining
individual and household data were conducted per survey
and site. The third step consisted of two-level analyses
combining longitudinal and individual data, and longitudinal and household data. These analyses were useful in
understanding seasonal and inter-annual dynamics and
allowed confirmation of the final results. Here we only
present the results of the three-level models, with survey,
individual and household as the three different levels.
We linked the occurrence of recent dengue infection
within a household with the landscape attributes of its
surroundings. Based on land cover maps, landscape factors were calculated for each household. The legend of the
land cover maps comprised:
1. Mixed deciduous forest.
2. Dry deciduous forest.
3. Bush or sparse forest.
4. Irrigated fields (wet): cultivated in March.
5. Irrigated fields (dry): not cultivated in March.
6. Old orchards (tree cover larger than 60%).
7. Water bodies and wide rivers.
8. Upland fields/young orchards (tree cover lower than
60%).
9. Sparsely vegetated area related to various human activities. No building or agriculture. (e.g. wasteland, grassy
area)
10. Densely built areas.
11. Village zones with dense vegetation.
12. Village zones with sparse vegetation.
Variables related to land cover were: (i) the percentage of
each land cover class in a 200-meter buffer (circle with a
200 meters radius) around each house; and (ii) the distance between each house and the nearest patch over
2,700 m2 (i.e. at least 4 Landsat pixels) for each land cover
class (except village zone classes). The distance from a

http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/5/1/5

house to the edge of the village was also calculated. Land
cover was considered unchanged over the three years of
the study, which was confirmed by field visits in each site
and for each year of the epidemiological survey. Landcover variables derived from the 2000 image can therefore
be considered valid for the epidemiological survey years,
from 2001 to 2003. Variables were categorized using
quantiles. No other criterion such as mosquito flight-distance was used.
Furthermore, to investigate whether cases of recent dengue infections were clustered, analyses of clustering in
time and in space were performed using the Kulldorff spatial scan statistic [24]. Clustering occurs when the probability of recent dengue infections is not randomly
distributed. A circular moving window, with a continuously varying radius, was used to analyze village maps.
Similarly, a temporal window was used to analyze the longitudinal data. For each window position, a statistic tested
whether there was an increased risk of infection within as
opposed to outside the window. The P-value was
obtained from a likelihood ratio test based on Monte
Carlo simulation with 9,999 replicates. The cluster analyses were performed per village using recent infections as
cases and non-infections as controls. Houses were used as
census areas. This method only detects circular clusters,
which was assumed to be appropriate for the spread of a
mosquito-borne disease, and it does account for varying
house densities.
Weather impact on dengue
The weather analysis was limited to deviations in temperature and rainfall of the survey years from the 1989–2003
average, for the following reasons. Weather data were only
available for provincial capitals (Chiang Mai and Lamphun), the exact month of infection was unknown and
weather variations are not constant between months
within a season.

Results
Details of the study population have been presented
before [13]. Briefly, in May 2001, 1928 persons were contacted and 1750 of them were followed-up in September
2001 (91%), constituting the individuals included in the
study. Of these, 28% were in Ban Pa Nai, 37% in Ban
Pang, and 35% in Mae Hia. Sex and age distribution differed per site (Table 1). Follow-up rates for the other surveys were 90%, 87%, 85% and 81%. Rates of recent
infection varied over time and between sites (Figure 2,
Table 2). Sex and age distribution of recently infected people also varied over time and between sites (Figures 3 and
4). Despite high rates of recent infection in several surveys, the number of cases reported in the calendar filled in
daily was low: 6, 5 and 5 cases in 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively, implying that most infections were asympto-

matic. The data from the district-level public health surveillance system showed 1 case of dengue in Ban Pang in
2001, 1 case in Mae Hia in 2002 and 8 cases in Mae Hia
in 2003. Therefore, the percentage of asymptomatic or
lightly symptomatic dengue cases (public health systems
records divided by recent infection data) varied over the
years, ranging from 65% in 2003 to 99.7% in 2002.
Although mostly relatively serious cases are reported to
the public health authorities, the number of self-reported
cases was also low, indicating that these rates are an
appropriate estimate.
Since determinants for recent dengue infection differed
substantially between sites, results are presented separately by site. The intraclass correlations for household
and individual levels were low, indicating that the lowest
level of analysis, i.e. time period, explained most of the
variance. There was a large variation in human behavior
over time.
Ban Pa Nai
Persons who mostly spent their daytime at school had a
lower risk of recent dengue infection compared to other
persons (Table 3). Bed nets protected against dengue
infection as did houses made of a combination of wood,
stone and concrete. Persons who went to the forest during
daytime, spent their evening around the house or had dinner after 18.00 h had an increased risk of dengue infection. People living within 60 m of irrigated fields had a
higher risk of infection. In contradiction with this, households surrounded for more than 40% by irrigated fields
had a two times lower risk.
Ban Pang
Students, unemployed persons and laborers had a lower
risk of dengue infection compared to housewives, farmers
and traders (Table 4). Spending daytime inside the house

or in the fields decreased the risk, as did spending the
evening inside the house. No important preventive measures were identified. Persons who lived in houses not surrounded by water containers or without domestic animals
had a lower risk. In contrast to Ban Pa Nai, persons who
lived further away from irrigated fields (> 600 m) had a
higher risk. In contradiction with this, persons in households with irrigated fields present within 200 m had a
higher risk than persons living in households with no irrigated fields in the surrounding.
Mae Hia
People who used abate (a larvicide targeting all mosquito
species and other insects) had a higher risk of dengue
infection (Table 5). People who reported to be sometimes
or often bitten by mosquitoes had a higher risk than people who reported to be never bitten. Persons living in
houses made of wood had a lower risk compared to persons living in other houses. People living further away (>
300 m) from orchards had a lower risk compared to persons living within 150 m from orchards. Persons living
more than 500 m from a lake or river or in a part of the
village with little vegetation had a higher risk of infection.
Persons having bare soils in the surrounding of their
house had a lower risk.

The results of the three-level models were consistent with
the results of the one and two-level models (results not
shown).

Cluster analyses
In all three sites the number of recently infected people
was significantly higher in 2002 than in 2001 and 2003 (p
< 0.0001), indicating temporal clustering of recent dengue
infection. In 2002, there were 72 observed instead of 38.2
expected cases in a spatial cluster in Ban Pa Nai, 274
observed instead of 131.2 expected cases in Ban Pang, and
192 observed against 66.2 expected cases in Mae Hia.
Within these temporal clusters, significant spatial clusters
were identified: two in Ban Pa Nai, one in Ban Pang and
one in Mae Hia (Figure 7). In Ban Pa Nai (Figure 5; only
one village and one cluster shown), the most significant
cluster was located in the southern part of the village, near
the edge of the village, and therefore near irrigated fields,
but in this case also near another part of the village. In Ban
Pang, the cluster was located in the western end of the village, far from the irrigated fields (Figure 6). In Ban Pa Nai,
one other spatial cluster was found in September 2003; 15
cases were observed whereas 4.7 were expected (p =
0.004).

Weather
The weather pattern in Chiang Mai and the infection rate
were not strongly correlated. In 2001 the temperature of
nine months differed significantly from the 1989–2003
average temperature in these months, including six colder
months, whereas in 2002 and 2003 this figure was three
months (t-test, p < 0.05), including two colder months
each year. For rainfall, 2001 had six months significantly
different from the 1989–2003 average rainfall for these
months (three months dryer than the average). 2002 had
eight anomalous months (three months dryer) and 2003
had seven (four months dryer). 2002 was thus more different in terms of rainfall than in terms of temperature.
The largest variations in rainfall are observed in the wet
season (May to October). 2002 had extreme rainfall in
November and December.

Discussion

determinants of recent dengue infection, and its pattern in

space and time, we conducted a prospective cohort study
in three dengue-endemic sites in Chiang Mai and Lamphun provinces, Thailand. By following a population biannually during three consecutive years, we located recently
infected individuals in space and time by analyzing dengue-specific antibody levels during each survey.
Individual-level risk determinants
Factors varying over time, that explain the largest part of
the variance, included several individual level determinants that were related to the location where people spent
their daytime and evenings. In both rural sites, students at
school had the lowest relative risk. This possibly relates to
the existing intensive prevention programs in and around
schools, involving for example breeding site elimination.
Being outside the house during daytime or evening
increased the risk of dengue infection suggesting that
transmission takes place outside the house in rural areas,
whereas this was not the case in the peri-urban study site.
Eating after 18.00 h can be associated with activities outside the house taking place later. The identification of
clusters of cases in neighboring houses suggests that trans-

mission also takes place in or around the house. The
decrease in risk associated with days spent in fields is associated with the absence of breeding sites in field cropping
areas, whereas days spent in the house, near sources of
mosquitoes, increased the risk. The increase in risk associated with the time spent in the forest is not well understood, since Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were not found
in the forest in the study area [Vanwambeke et al., forthcoming].
Several studies showed that dengue risk exposure is more
important in and around the house because female Ae.
aegypti are highly domesticated, and Aedes mosquitoes
mostly bite during daytime with pronounced peaks of
activity around sunrise and sunset [25,26]. Activity can be
prolonged at night in urbanized areas, possibly due to the
higher light intensity at night [26]. Field observations in
our study area, however, suggest that Ae. albopictus is
found in villages and in orchards, [Vanwambeke et al.,
forthcoming], where people could also be infected during
peak biting times. Several other studies suggest that Ae.
albopictus probably serves as a maintenance vector of den-

gue in rural areas of South-East Asia [27,28]. In terms of
infection control, this indicates that larval control around
houses is relevant, but also that prevention of bites in or
around the house could make substantial contribution to
the control of infection, as well as similar measures in
orchards.
In Mae Hia, being bitten during the day increased the risk
of dengue infection, which directly relates to the vector
activity. It is however not clear whether this determinant
relates to the mosquito population or to the exposure to
biting. Also, this variable describes subjective reporting by

Preventive measures
In Thailand, dengue control is focused on vector elimination rather than personal protection. The use of abate (a
larvicide) in Mae Hia and the use of bed nets in Ban Pa
Nai were the only preventive measures related to dengue
infection in our study. The use of abate in Mae Hia was
actually related to an increase in the risk of dengue infection, suggesting that this preventive measure was applied
too late when the larval population had already reached
high levels, or was applied incorrectly, for example by not
treating all containers. In two villages in North-Eastern
Thailand, Eamchan et al. [29] observed only limited success with the use of abate: not all containers were treated
or covered. Also, the relationship between the use of preventive measures and disease prevalence is not always
straightforward, as was observed by Thomson et al. [30].
The use of bednets in The Gambia was highly correlated
to the density of mosquito, whereas the disease prevalence could not easily be related to bednet use. Rosenberg
et al. [31] also raised the possibility that, in a village in
southeastern Thailand, bednets were used mostly when
the risk of infection was low but the nuisance of mosquitoes highest. Information on the level of nuisance caused
by mosquitoes or on the observable level of the larvae
population, and on the way in which people apply abate
in and around their house would help in understanding
these results.

The protective effect of bednets in Ban Pa Nai is unexpected when accounting for the fact that Aedes mosquitoes
do not bite at night-time. However, it could be related to
the early-morning peak of biting activity of Aedes mosquitoes when many people are still in bed. It could also protect children during the day. The potential role of bednets
in preventing dengue infection was mentioned by Thavara
et al. [32]. It is worth remembering also that many previous studies were focused on urban areas, whereas here the
significant preventive effect of bednets was observed in a
rural setting. The relation between the use of bednets and
other individual or household-level characteristics such as
knowledge of dengue was tested but no association was
found. Again, more locally-collected information about
the timing of activity peaks in mosquitoes, in relation to
people's activity timing, would help to interpret the protective effect of bednets. The impact of the use of electric
light at night could influence activity times for Aedes mosquitoes [25].
Generally, few preventive measures had statistically significant effects. Their use had even contradictory effects as
shown by the case of abate larvicide. This suggests that the
timing of prevention is crucial. The use of bednets could

have a more important role in dengue infection prevention than previously thought, as indicated by its significant protective effect.
Household level effects included the type of housing in
Ban Pa Nai and Mae Hia. People living in houses made of
a combination of materials had a lower risk; the causal
link behind this variable is not clear. In Ban Pang the significant household variables are related to the vector ecology. Houses with no water containers around the house,
therefore providing no breeding sites, had a lower risk.
Houses with no domestic animals had a lower risk as well.
Animals could provide alternative blood sources. However, Aedes mosquitoes are highly anthropophilic. The

presence of animals might enhance the attractivity of the
house, but mosquitoes would only bite humans.
Landscape and land-cover variables
Land cover may be an important risk determinant for
infection, depending on whether the landscape surrounding a person supports a large mosquito population or not,
mostly by providing breeding habitats. In this study, we
attempted to directly relate landscape features with the
risk of dengue infection, by-passing a quantification of
mosquito population in different habitats. The results
indicate that land cover and spatial organization of villages and surrounding landscape play a role in dengue
infection. However, great care in interpreting results

related to land cover is needed. In Mae Hia, results highlight the role of land cover as a source of breeding habitat.
Orchards often contain a variety of artificial water containers, which would offer alternative breeding sites for
Aedes while improved housing conditions offer less breeding habitats around houses. Proximity to orchards
increased the risk of infection in Mae Hia, whereas the
presence of bare soils around the house decreased that
risk. Bare soils are unsuitable for Aedes breeding. Other
variables were not easy to interpret, such as the distance to
water bodies. This could be a proxy for other features,
including socio-economic variables. The variable related
to the importance of village area with dense vegetation
does not correspond to breeding preferences of Aedes

mosquitoes but could be related to housing type or quality.
Location of possible clusters and landscape spatial pattern
should be considered together when interpreting the land
cover effects on infection risk. In Ban Pa Nai, the apparent
contradiction of the effect of proximity to irrigated field
decreasing the risk on the one hand and of the proportion
of irrigated field effect (decreasing the risk with increasing
proportion) on the other hand is caused by the particular
spatial configuration of the villages and the location of the
cluster. The cluster is indeed located near the edge of the
village, but with few irrigated fields around. Irrigated
fields offer no suitable breeding habitat for Aedes and

therefore do not act as a source of mosquitoes, whereas
village areas do.
A similar effect was observed in Ban Pang: the location of
the cluster further away from the irrigated fields explains
the effect of distance to irrigated fields (wet), while a
higher risk for people living with a higher proportion of
irrigated fields around possibly proxies another effect.
This variable is significantly correlated with none of the
other landscape characteristics. The orchards found in this
area are much older and possibly influence mosquito
breeding and transmission differently than younger
orchards. These houses are also located close to the main
road.
Our results indicate that land cover needs to be considered in dengue transmission dynamics, especially landcover types providing breeding habitats, but that varying
local conditions will strongly influence the importance
and role of the landscape on the risk of infection. Previously unused habitats, such as orchards, might be found
in increasingly important land-cover types in a context of
housing improvement as observed in the suburbs of Chiang Mai. Agricultural land covers can no longer be ignored
in dengue control given the rising prevalence of dengue in
rural areas. Improved knowledge on vector ecology,
behavior and dispersal, especially regarding Ae. albopictus,
and on the role of this vector in dengue transmission
would greatly improve interpretation of land cover effects
[Vanwambeke et al., forthcoming]. GIS can be a useful
tool since it integrates spatial and environmental variables
and locates cases of infection to identify high-risk areas
and environmental determinants. The spatial configuration of villages needs to be considered when considering
spatial patterns of infection and a thorough knowledge of
vector ecology can also help in understanding the
observed patterns.
Cluster analyses
The peak incidence of recent dengue infection took place
in 2002 for all study sites, corresponding with the temporal cluster identified by analysis of spatial and temporal
clustering. During this peak year, some areas within a site
were more affected than others, indicating variation in
local infection patterns. As was shown in the multi-level
analysis, the determinants for recent dengue infection differed between sites and, as shown by the spatial clusters,
possibly within sites. Moreover, the intraclass correlation
for individual and household level was very low, thus the
largest part of variance was explained by factors varying
over time: conditions might have been more favorable in
2002. These results show that the focal nature of the infection does not only exist for symptomatic dengue cases but
also occurs in asymptomatic infections, and indicates the
relevance of studying asymptomatic dengue infection.

http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/5/1/5

The clusters could also relate to host-pathogen dynamics.
A radiating pattern emanating from Bangkok has been
described by others [5,33,34]. The radiating pattern in
symptomatic dengue cases is thought to reflect host-pathogen population dynamics [35], but what causes the wave
pattern of asymptomatic infections is unknown. It might
be related to changes in the year-round circulation of dengue virus [36,37], since infection took place both between
May and September and between September and May.
Serotypes were not measured in this study, and the peak
of infections in 2002 observed in our study did not correspond with the peak in symptomatic dengue cases that
occurred in 2001. National data showed that the main
serotype in 2000 and 2001 was serotype 1, whereas in
2002 serotype 2 was the main serotype detected (Ministry
of Public Health, Dept. of Disease Control). The percentage of asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic infections
was high but varied over the years as was shown by others
[10,14]. The focal nature of dengue in space and time was
observed in other studies and could be related to clusters
of Aedes [34,38,39].
Limitations of the study
Factors determining the spatial and temporal clustering
were not specifically investigated in this study, but would
deserve further work. Clustering could have several origins: host-pathogen dynamics, national scale radiating
patterns of cases, mosquito-vector ecology, or individual
or household-level risk determinants. Such a study would
however require a different data collection approach.

Note also that no household-level entomological data
were collected as part of this study.

Conclusion
Our study showed that the focal nature of dengue not
only appears in symptomatic dengue cases, but also exists
for asymptomatic dengue infections. Environmental variables were significant, but the interpretation of their effect
needs to combine several types of information such as the
existence and location of clusters and vector ecology. The
great variation of determinants for recent dengue infection in space and time should be taken into account when
designing local dengue control programs.
