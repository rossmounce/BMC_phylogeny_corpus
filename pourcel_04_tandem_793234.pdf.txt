Abstract
Background: Yersinia pestis, the agent of plague, is a young and highly monomorphic species. Three
biovars, each one thought to be associated with the last three Y. pestis pandemics, have been
defined based on biochemical assays. More recently, DNA based assays, including DNA sequencing,
IS typing, DNA arrays, have significantly improved current knowledge on the origin and
phylogenetic evolution of Y. pestis. However, these methods suffer either from a lack of resolution
or from the difficulty to compare data. Variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) provides
valuable polymorphic markers for genotyping and performing phylogenetic analyses in a growing
number of pathogens and have given promising results for Y. pestis as well.
Results: In this study we have genotyped 180 Y. pestis isolates by multiple locus VNTR analysis
(MLVA) using 25 markers. Sixty-one different genotypes were observed. The three biovars were
distributed into three main branches, with some exceptions. In particular, the Medievalis phenotype
is clearly heterogeneous, resulting from different mutation events in the napA gene. Antiqua strains
from Asia appear to hold a central position compared to Antiqua strains from Africa. A subset of
7 markers is proposed for the quick comparison of a new strain with the collection typed here.
This can be easily achieved using a Web-based facility, specifically set-up for running such
identifications.
Conclusion: Tandem-repeat typing may prove to be a powerful complement to the existing
phylogenetic tools for Y. pestis. Typing can be achieved quickly at a low cost in terms of
consumables, technical expertise and equipment. The resulting data can be easily compared
between different laboratories. The number and selection of markers will eventually depend upon
the type and aim of investigations.

Background
Within the Y. pestis species, strains are separated into three
biovars according to their ability to reduce nitrate and to
ferment glycerol [1]. Since Y. pestis was connected to

plague by Yersin [2], strains of biovar Antiqua have been
generally isolated from Asia and from East and Central
Africa, Medievalis was found in Central Asia, and Orientalis worldwide. Y. pestis is thought to have recently evolved

from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, some 1,500 to 20,000
years ago [3]. Based on the biochemical assays, Devignat
[1] proposed that Antiqua strains, causing probably the
first known pandemic, represent the ancestor. Medievalis
strains are suggested to be responsible for the second pandemic whereas the third pandemic was associated exclusively with Orientalis strains. This overall scenario,
although not formally established, is supported by the
observed higher diversity in the Antiqua and Medievalis
biovars as measured by IS typing and the geographic origin of strains [3-5]. "Pestoides" strains are particular Y.
pestis isolates found recently in Russia, and which infect
unique species of rodents [5,6].
Several molecular methods have been used for genotyping
Y. pestis strains, mostly based on pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), insertion sequence polymorphism and
ribotyping. Recently, multiple locus variable-number-oftandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) was shown to be
a promising method for genotyping a number of pathogens [7-15]. When applicable, MLVA is of great interest,
because data produced in different laboratories can be
easily exchanged and merged. This is especially relevant in
the case of pathogens such as Y. pestis, for which strains
cannot be easily exchanged for security reasons. In this
context, the availability of standardized and easy to set-up
typing tools to facilitate the research efforts on this pathogen is important. The complete genomic sequences of Y.
pestis CO92 [16], biovar Orientalis, and of strain KIM
[17], biovar Medievalis, have been determined, facilitating the identification of tandem repeats and consequently
the selection of primers for MLVA [8,15].
Until now only small series of Y. pestis strains were typed
by MLVA [8,9] and although the method seemed appropriate to genotype reproducibly and accurately, a large
scale study seemed necessary. In the present work, a collection of 180 isolates of Y. pestis, from different geographical origins, and including various Y. pestis reference
strains were typed using the 25 VNTRs previously
described [8].

Results
MLVA genotyping
The 25 loci could be amplified (Figure 1 and Additional
file 1) in all 180 isolates (Table 1), with the exception of
locus ms06 which failed to yield a PCR amplification
product in three strains (corresponding to genotypes 4
and 5, Figure 2) despite numerous attempts. Sixty-one different genotypes were identified in this collection, numbered 1 to 61 (Figure 2). Clustering analysis correctly
separates Y. pestis Orientalis isolates comprising genotypes 9 to 51 from Antiqua (genotypes 2, 3 and 5 to 8) and
Medievalis (genotypes 4 and 52 to 61). Antiqua strains of
essentially African origin (genotypes 2, 3, 5, comprising 6

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/22

different strains) and the four Antiqua strains from Russia
and Asia (genotype 6 and 7 originating from Russia [18]
and genotype 8, Antiqua strains KUMA and Yokohama
originating from Manchuria and Japan) are clearly separated. Within biovar Orientalis, a group of isolates among
which CO92 (genotype 15) has been assigned to the
IS100 typing group O1 using the PCR-based typing
method described by Motin et al. [5] (data not shown;
results indicated in Figure 2). This demonstrates that the
MLVA clustering correlates well with another molecular
typing method. Additional PCR-IS100 typing indicates
that the other Orientalis strains, mostly from Vietnam, are
of the O2a type (Figure 2). This is in agreement with the
report from Motin et al. [5] suggesting an association of
O2a with South-East Asia. These Orientalis isolates are
further separated by MLVA into three main branches comprising genotypes 27 to 51. One representative from each
Orientalis genotype (genotypes 9 to 51) was assayed by
PCR for the presence of the glpD deletion characterised by
Motin et al. All strains yield a PCR product of the size corresponding to the deleted allele (data not shown).
Most Medievalis strains are also clustered into one major
branch (genotypes 52 to 61) with the exception of the
strain representing genotype 4. The Pestoides isolate from
Georgia (genotype 1) is (weakly) grouped with the African
Antiqua strains. Among Antiqua isolates, the KUMA and
Yokohama isolates show the identical MLVA genotype 8,
and possess a seemingly specific ms09 allele.
As a complementary analysis, a minimum spanning tree
analysis was performed (Figure 3). This kind of analysis is
applicable to categorical data sets (see also [19]). The creation of hypothetical types (open circles) further minimizes the summed distance of all branches of the tree. The
numbers indicated in the circles correspond to the genotype numbers listed in Figure 2. The Orientalis strains
(genotypes 9 to 51) are closely related, and are grouped
into a single complex. The O2a strains from Vietnam constitute a well-defined subgroup. The backbone of the O2a
cluster is made by genotypes 28, 40, 46, 48, which altogether represent 97 isolates. The two Antiqua strains
KUMA and Yokohama from Asia (genotype 8) are clearly
located outside of the Orientalis group in this analysis, in
a position intermediate between the Medievalis group
(genotypes 52 to 61) and the Orientalis group. All strains
classified as Medievalis strains based on the nitrate reductase assay fall within this group, with one exception, the
strain from Kenya defining genotype 4 which is very close
to Antiqua genotype 5 (two strains from Kenya and
Congo). The six genotypes representing Antiqua strains
(African strains, genotypes 2, 3, 5; Asian strains, genotypes
6 to 8) are very loosely connected to each other, suggesting a very high diversity of this biovar.

Figure 1
Illustration of the MLVA assay set-up
Illustration of the MLVA assay set-up The PCR products of an amplification using primers "ms01" (on the left) or primers
"ms04" (on the right) have been loaded on an agarose gel, electrophoresed, and stained with ethidium bromide. Lanes M are a
20 bp ladder molecular weight marker. Samples 1 to 7 correspond to a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strain (lane 1), Yersinia pestis
strains representing genotype 18 in Figure 2 (EV76 DNA from 4 different origins, lanes 2, 4, 5, 7, and a strain from Turkey, lane
6), Yersinia pestis strain KIM (lane 3). The image illustrates how the number of units can be directly deduced by manual reading.
The marker names below the gel provide the repeat unit size of the tandem repeat, the expected PCR product size in the
CO92 genome, and the corresponding number of units in the CO92 genome.

At least two independent types of Medievalis strains
The strain representing genotype 4 is nitrate-reductase
negative, and for this reason has been phenotypically
assigned to the biovar Medievalis. However, its position
in Figures 2 and 3, being very close to genotype 5 (Antiqua
strains) and very distinct from the Medievalis cluster, and
its geographic origin from Kenya prompted us to investigate the origin of nitrate-reductase deficiency in more
detail. The Medievalis strain KIM is nitrate-reductase deficient because of a single point mutation in the napA gene

[17]. We have analyzed all Medievalis strains from genotypes 52 to 61 and they showed the same point mutation
(data not shown). In contrast the napA gene in the strain
representing genotype 4 has been inactivated by a deletion as seen by the absence of amplification of the gene in
spite of the use of different primers from this locus, and
the absence of an hybridisation signal in a Southern blot
experiment (data not shown).

Discussion
In the present report, an MLVA typing assay comprising 25
markers has been applied to a collection of Y. pestis isolates of various origins, but with a strong bias towards Orientalis strains from South-East Asia. One hundred and
eighty strains or isolates (Table 1) have been genotyped
and 61 different MLVA genotypes were identified (see
Additional file 1). Clustering analysis and minimum
spanning tree analysis suggest relations between the different strains and biovars which are in excellent agreement with current knowledge. In spite of the very limited
number of Antiqua and Medievalis strains which could be
investigated here, the data obtained suggest the existence
of two groups of Antiqua strains. The first group from Russia and Asia represented by genotypes 6, 7 (from Russia)
and 8 (KUMA, Yokohama) holds an intermediate position between the Medievalis and the Orientalis group. The
second group comprises the African Antiqua strains.
IS100 typing distinguishes the KUMA and Yokohama iso-

lates which were typed as A2 and A1b type, respectively
[5]. They are very similar in DNA microarrays studies [20].
Medievalis and Orientalis strains derive from Antiqua
strains by the loss of metabolic functions, respectively the
capacity to reduce nitrate, and to metabolize glycerol.
Whereas all Orientalis strains investigated so far (and
including this report) are derived from a single ancestor
carrying a simple deletion in the glpD gene [5], we report
here that the Medievalis phenotype can be associated with
at least two independent mutation events in the napA
gene. This underlines the fact that the initial biochemical
tests should be complemented, or replaced, by direct
molecular analyses of the glpD and napA genes.
It is tempting to speculate about possible scenarios suggested by Figure 3 and current knowledge. Pestoides
strains originate from Central Asia (reviewed in [6]), and
are proposed to be an outgroup of the Y. pestis group.
Their genetic composition is relatively distinct from Y.
pestis, in terms of plasmids and chromosome, as assayed
by DNA array analysis for instance [20]. In Figure 3, the
Pestoides strain studied is very distantly related to an
hypothetical missing link close to the center of the figure.
Hypothetical missing links (open circles) are created by

the Minimum Spanning Tree software if they result in a
reduction of the total tree length. Many missing links are
suggested by the software in this area. They enable the
connection of the three branches made of the African
Antiqua group, the Medievalis group, and the Orientalis
group. The strains closest to this central position are the
Antiqua strains from Asia. This and the position of the
Pestoides strain suggest that all three biovars may originate from Asia. Indeed, much more strains from these
regions will be needed to test this hypothesis. For
instance, strain Nicholinsk51 was shown by [5] to share
some features of Orientalis strains while being an Antiqua
strain from Asia. The authors favored the hypothesis that
this strain was a revertant from the Orientalis phenotype.
We would rather predict that Nicholinsk51 will be placed
by MLVA analysis between the central group of Figure 3
and the Orientalis group.
In total, in our study and that of Klevytska et al. [9], 61
VNTRs were characterized, and still more exist in the Y.
pestis genome [15] that can be tested for the selection of an
optimal set for MLVA if necessary. Different questions can
be addressed by different sets of tandem repeat loci. Global phylogenetic investigations will best be done using
loci with a low or moderate mutation rate. Forensics, or
local outbreaks investigations, may use loci with a higher
mutation rate and particularly simple sequence repeats
such as the tetranucleotide described by Adair et al. [21].
Mutation rate of a tandem repeat locus and phylogenetic
value is very poorly predicted from sequence analysis
[15,22] so that it has to be experimentally measured by
typing collections of isolates, as done here (Table 2 and
Additional file 1).

Conclusion
Once set-up, MLVA is a very powerful and reproducible
genotyping method and it is hoped that this simple
molecular tool will help unravel the molecular phylogeny
of Yersinia pestis when being applied to a larger number of
isolates. In comparison, MLST analysis [3] proved to be
almost non informative within Y. pestis. DNA array analysis [20,23] shows a very low resolution with only a few
different genotypes identified so far. IS typing by Southern
blotting has a very high discriminatory power, but the
resulting data is not easily comparable between different
laboratories. PCR-IS typing developed by Motin et al. [5]
provides exchangeable data but with a much reduced resolution as compared to classical IS typing. MLVA typing
may thus turn out to be the method of choice for Y. pestis,
once more isolates will have been typed, common genotype databases put together, and reference collections of
markers selected. As one step in this direction, the data has
been made accessible on our Web site http://bacterialgenotyping.igmors.u-psud.fr. This includes not only the
full dataset which can be recovered from Additional file 1,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/22

but also the possibility to run queries with new MLVA
data. This may be of use for investigators lacking the specialized tools or expertise required to run MLVA clustering
analyses. A very satisfying typing resolution (but not a
robust phylogenetic analysis) can readily be achieved by
PCR amplification of only 7 loci.

Methods
Bacterial strains and isolates
Most of the strains are from the collection maintained by
the French ministry of defense at Centre d'Etudes du Bouchet (CEB) and others came from French medical military
institutions [24]. The Y. pestis strains were isolated mostly
in Asia between 1964 and 1979, some in Africa (Kenya,
Congo), Kurdistan and Madagascar. Additional reference
strains and DNA isolates of different biovars, as identified
by the source laboratories, are from the Institute of Microbiology Federal Armed Forces, Munich (Germany), or
were kindly provided by Prof. F. Allerberger (Vienna, Austria), Prof. H. Tschäpe (Wernigerode, Germany), Pr H.
Mollaret, Dr E. Carniel (Paris, France) and Dr. A. Rakin
(Munich, Germany) (Table 1). Thermolysates were prepared by heating a bacterial suspension in water for 30
min at 95°C.
Biovar assignment by molecular tests
The presence of an intact glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpD) gene was tested by PCR as described [5].
Sixty three isolates were typed by PCR for the presence of
four IS100 insertions (vlm04 and vlm05, vlm06, vlm25,
vlm28) as described by Motin et al. [5]. The single nucleotide change in napA resulting in nitrate reductase deficiency in strain KIM [17] was used in a SNP typing assay.
Primers napAFor (5' GCGCTAAAAGAGAAAGGCCCGA
3') and either SNPnapKIM (5' AGAGCACGAAGGCATCGGCTTA 3') or SNPnapCO92 (5' AGAGCACGAAGGCATCGGCTTC 3') were used in two PCR reactions at
58°C annealing temperature producing a 230 bp amplicon in either reaction.
Minisatellite PCR amplification and genotyping
PCR reactions and analyses were performed as described
[8] using 25 polymorphic markers (Figure 1). Markers
ypms04, ypms05, ypms07, ypms20, ypms45 and ypms62
correspond respectively to marker M58, M59, M37, M51,
M42 and M34 in Klevytska et al. [9] (Table 2).
Data management and analyses
Gel images were analyzed using the bionumerics software
package version 3.5 (Applied-Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem,
Belgium) as previously described [10]. The number of
motifs in each allele was deduced from the amplicon size.
The resulting data were analyzed with bionumerics as a
character dataset. Clustering analysis was done using the
categorical parameter and the Ward coefficient. The mini-

mum spanning tree was constructed with the following
options: (a) in case of equivalent solutions in terms of calculated distances, the priority rule used was to select the
tree with the highest number of branches connecting genotypes differing at only one locus ("Highest number of
single locus variants" option).; (b) the creation of hypothetical types (missing links) reducing the total length of
the tree was allowed. Polymorphism indexes for each
locus were calculated as 1 minus the sum of the squares of
the frequency of each allele within the different genotypes
identified. The data produced was made accessible from a
Web page http://bacterial-genotyping.igmors.u-psud.fr as
previously described [10] taking advantage of the
BNServer application (Applied-Maths, Sint-MartensLatem, Belgium).

Authors' contributions
FAM did most of the typing work and CP and GV did the
error checking analysis. CP performed the biovar assignment by molecular tests and the PCR-IS typing. FR was in
charge of the CEB strain collection and prepared the DNA
samples. HN provided DNA from a number of additional
reference strains. GV initiated and managed the project,
and was in charge of the Bionumerics database and clustering analyses. CP, HN, and GV wrote the report. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
