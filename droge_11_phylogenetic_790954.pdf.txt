Phylogenetic analysis reveals wide distribution of
globin X
Jasmin Dröge and Wojciech Makałowski*

Abstract
The vertebrate globin gene repertoire consists of seven members that differ in terms of structure, function and
phyletic distribution. While hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytoglobin, and neuroglobin are present in almost all
gnathostomes examined so far, other globin genes, like globin X, are much more restricted in their phyletic
distribution. Till today, globin X has only been found in teleost fish and Xenopus. Here, we report that globin X is
also present in the genomes of the sea lamprey, ghost shark and reptiles. Moreover, the identification of orthologs
of globin X in crustacean, insects, platyhelminthes, and hemichordates confirms its ancient origin.
Findings
Globins are small heme proteins that bind various external
ligands, such as oxygen and nitric oxide, and they are
found in all kingdoms of life [1]. Best known are hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb), which have been studied
for a long time to understand relationships between protein function and structure. In the past ten years, several
new members of the globin gene family were added to the
vertebrate’s globin gene repertoire. Neuroglobin (Ngb) and
cytoglobin (Cygb) are highly conserved and present in all
gnathostomes examined till today [2-4]. Other novel globin genes are much more restricted in their phyletic distributions, e.g. globin Y (GbY) has been found in Xenopus,
lizards, and platypus while globin E (GbE) is only
expressed in the eyes of birds [5-7]. Finally, globin X
(GbX) seems to be restricted to the genomes of teleost
fish and Xenopus [5,8]. The physiological functions of
these novel globin proteins are unknown, although a species-specific regulation of GbX under hypoxic conditions
has been observed [9,10]. Here, we show that the GbX
gene is not just restricted to teleost fish and Xenopus genomes, but is also present in the genomes of sea lamprey,
ghost shark, and reptiles. Additionally, several invertebrate
orthologs of GbX were detected in crustacean, insects, platyhelminthes, and hemichordates, confirming its ancient
origin.
The BLAST algorithms [11] were employed to search
the non-redundant protein database of NCBI, the

sequence databases at the GenBank and the genomic
sequences of the sea lamprey, the ghost shark, the Burmese python, and the green anole lizard for homologous
globin proteins. Corresponding nucleotide sequences
were extracted from the genomes and translation start
sites and splice sites were predicted using GENSCAN
and GeneNet2, respectively, and manually adjusted
[12-14]. The ExPASy Molecular Biology Server at the
Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics was used for the translation of the putative CDS (http://www.expasy.org).
A table with accession numbers of sequences used in
the consecutive analyses and a table with CDS
sequences of the newly annotated genes are provided in
the supplementary materials [see Additional file 1]. The
derived sequences were initially aligned using the MUSCLE program and manually refined [15]. The alignment
is provided in the supplementary materials [see Additional file 2]. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches.
The program package RAxML 7.2.8 [16,17] was
employed for maximum likelihood analyses using the
rapid bootstrapping algorithm with 1,000 bootstrap
replications. Bayesian analyses were conducted in
MrBayes 3.1.2 [18,19] using default priors. Two simultaneous Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo
samplings were performed with one cold and three
heated chains that were run for 5,000,000 generations.
The trees were sampled every 100th generation and the
‘burn in’ was set to 25%. For the calculation of the phylogenetic trees, the CIPRES portal was used (CIPRES
Web Portal V3.1) [20]. Phylogenetic analyses were based

on the WAG [21] model of amino acid evolution assuming gamma distribution of substitution rates, as suggested by analysis of the alignment with ProtTest3 [22].
The phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL [23].
Similarity searches for putative GbX proteins in the nr
protein database of NCBI using GbX of zebrafish as
query [GenPept: NP_001012261] resulted in the identification of several homologous invertebrate globin proteins
and a partial GbX sequence of the green anole lizard
[GenPept: XP_003228427]. A tBLASTn search against
several vertebrate genomes revealed that GbX is not
restricted to teleost fish and amphibians. The GbX gene
is also present in the genomes of green anole lizard, Burmese python, ghost shark, and sea lamprey. While teleost
fish possess only one copy of the GbX gene, X. tropicalis
may indeed contain two GbX genes [5]. For lizard and
python we obtained sequences that each correspond to a
single GbX gene. Interestingly, ghost shark and sea lamprey may possess two copies of the GbX gene. The coding regions of fish and amphibian GbX are distributed on
five exons. The introns are located at positions B12.2 (i.e.
between the second and third base of the 12th codon in
globin helix B), G7.0, E10.2 and H10.0 [8]. The putative
lizard and python GbX genes consist of four coding
exons and were found on chrUn_GL343635 and on several contigs (contig24997472, contig25376860, contig25192522, contig25757037), respectively. We couldn’t
locate the first coding exon of fish and Xenopus GbX,
comprising the N-terminal extension and some part of
the globin domain (on average the first 57 amino acids),
completely in the lizard and partially in the python genome. Moreover, in python the last coding exon comprising the C-terminal extension of the protein seems to be
absent. Interestingly, we were able to identify the first
coding exon in the previous assembly of the lizard genome (anoCar1.0). Thus, it is most likely that complete
first and last coding exons couldn’t be found due to missing sequence data and/or due to miss-assembly. The
potential CDSs of lizard and python GbX translate into
peptides of 200 and 129 amino acids, respectively. The
putative ghost shark and sea lamprey GbX genes consist
of five coding exons and are distributed on several scaffolds (AAVX01210948, AAVX0160156, AAVX01601570,
AAVX01646770, AAVX01022872, AAVX01385372,
AAVX01173359, AAVX01250480) and contigs (contig19308, contig21159, contig11157, contig27503),
respectively. The putative cDNAs of ghost shark and sea
lamprey GbX translate into peptides of 193 and 222
amino acids, respectively. Interestingly, in both species
we found partial sequences of a putative second GbX
gene (GbX-2). The partial GbX-2 genes of lamprey and
shark reside on contig20413, contig362 and on
AAVX01509327, AAVX01477794, respectively. For the
sea lamprey coding exons two to four were identified

Page 2 of 5

that translate into a peptide of 103 amino acids that is
71% identical and (based on BLOSUM62) 88% similar to
the other copy of GbX (GbX-1). For the ghost shark only
coding exons two and three were identified that translate
into a peptide of 75 amino acids. The GbX-2 peptide of
the ghost shark is 67% identical and 83% similar to GbX1. Since large parts of the putative GbX-2 genes couldn’t
be found in the genomes, those sequences might represent pseudo-genes. The key residues important in oxygen
binding, like the proximal and distal histidines in the Eand F-helix (HisE7, HisF8) and the phenylalanine in the
CD region (PheCD1) are strictly conserved in all new
annotated GbX proteins.
The newly found vertebrate GbX proteins, the putative
orthologous globin proteins of the lancelet [24] as well as
several homologous invertebrate globin proteins were
added to the alignment of vertebrate GbX and Ngb proteins. We refrained from including the GbX-2 proteins of
the ghost shark and sea lamprey because of the incompleteness of the data. The sequences of pea aphid and
Daphnia pulex globin proteins were corrected based on
available EST sequences (GL350495, FF335385,
FE368658, FE407975 and FE407974). Various phylogenetic trees were constructed employing the maximum
likelihood and Bayesian algorithms. Because of the high
divergence of non-metazoan globin proteins and in order
to identify orthologous relationships between GbX and
invertebrate globin proteins, the closest vertebrate relative of GbX, namely Ngb, was treated as an outgroup
(DreNgb, XtrNgb). As expected, the new annotated GbX
proteins from sea lamprey, ghost shark and reptiles
group with GbX from teleost fish and Xenopus with high
bootstrap support (Figure 1). However, the clustering of
the GbX proteins is not in accordance with the species
tree. For example, in our phylogenetic trees GbX from
sea lamprey is closer related to GbX of reptiles than to
GbX of the ghost shark. The discrepancy of gene and
species tree may be caused by the overall comparable
similarity of the GbX proteins which ranges from 70% to
88% (based on BLOSUM62). However, under the
assumption that the gene tree is correct, we would
assume a scenario in which the last common ancestor of
vertebrates possessed multiple copies of GbX and in
which several losses of GbX genes occurred in the evolution of vertebrates. In this scenario the GbX proteins of
e.g. teleost fish and reptiles would rather be paralogs
than orthologs. Analyses of additional vertebrate genomes will be necessary to resolve this issue. Interestingly,
in all phylogenetic reconstructions, the vertebrate GbX
proteins consistently group with putative globin proteins
of the pea aphid (ApiGb1), human body louse (PhucoGbD), Daphnia pulex (DpuGb), two Schistosoma species (SjaGb, SmaGb), and the acorn worm (Saccoglossus
kowalevskii) (SkoGb1-4). This branching was supported

by bootstrap support up to 96% depending on the number of analyzed species and the kind of analysis. Support
for orthology of these globin proteins was further
obtained by analyzing the organization at the genomic
level. Within teleost fish and Xenopus, the genomic
region containing GbX is conserved in gene order and
arrangement. The GbX gene of the zebrafish resides on
chromosome 17 between the genes for signal recognition
particle 14 (srp14) and pleckstrin homology domain-containing family G, member 3 (plekgh3) [5,24]. The putative orthologous globin proteins of the acorn worm
(SkoGb1-4) lie next to each other on one genomic scaffold and thus may have arisen by duplications of an
ancestral GbX gene. Interestingly, they are close to the
putative ortholog of srp14 [see Additional file 3]. Thus,

we propose that these globins are orthologs of vertebrate
GbX. Further phylogenetic interpretation of the tree suggests that the monophyletic clade, comprising the putative orthologous globin proteins of the lancelet (BflGb3,
BflGb12-14) and an additional putative globin from the
acorn worm (SkoGb5), contains paralogs of vertebrate
GbX. The SkoGb5 gene of the acorn worm resides in a
similar genomic neighborhood as GbX of the analyzed
euteleostei fish species. While the direct neighbors of vertebrate GbX are not detectable on this scaffold, the homologs
of gremlin 1 (grem1) and dnaj (HSP40) homolog subfamily
C member 17 (dnajc17), both located downstream of euteleostei fish GbX, reside in close proximity of SkoGb5.
Hence, it is likely that this genomic organization arose by a
duplication of the region comprising the ancestral GbX

Dröge and Makałowski Biology Direct 2011, 6:54

gene. Thus, we propose that the globin SkoGb5 of the
acorn worm as well as the amphioxus globins (BflGb3,
BflGb12-14) are paralogous to vertebrate GbX and that,
most probably, the lancelet and higher vertebrates have
each lost one copy of GbX.
Our phylogenetic analysis supports the scenario that
the GbX gene is a product of a duplication event that
predates the divergence between protostomes and deuterostomes [8,24]. As reported before, we were not able
to detect GbX in the genomes of mammals and birds.
Thus, it seems that GbX was lost twice in vertebrate evolution. Interestingly, the vertebrate lineages that possess a
GbX gene represent ectothermic animals while those
who lost the GbX gene are endotherms. This distribution
may give some hints towards GbX function. Moreover, it
will be interesting to see if the ectothermic crocodiles,
which are a sister group of birds, own a GbX gene. Crocodiles possess a four-chambered heart which is a characteristic of endotherms in which higher metabolic rates
would select for the perfect separation of blood. This led
to the hypothesis that the ancestors of crocodilians and
birds were endothermic [25]. It will be intriguing to see if
GbX was lost in the lineage leading to birds or if was
already lost in stem archosaurs.

since a part of the globin domain is absent in the current
version. Other members of the vertebrate globin gene
family were not added to the alignment to improve readability of the tree. Moreover, globin X sequences share
only little sequence similarity with other vertebrate globin types. We agree that the amphioxus genes (BflGb3,
12, 13, 14) represent a distinct class derived from a separate duplication event predating bilaterian radiation.

for Developmental Biology, Tübingen, Germany

Thank you for your comment that gives us the opportunity to clarify our methodology. The analysis was conducted without prior expectations. A BLAST search was
carried out using vertebrate globin X as query to search
for similar sequences in invertebrate species. Subsequently, phylogenetic trees were computed to identify
relationships between sequences. Neuroglobin was chosen as an outgroup, because it is assumed that neuroglobin emerged before the split of protostomier and
deuterostomier. Moreover, globin X is closer related to
neuroglobin than to any other vertebrate globin type
with identity values ranging from 26% to 34.6%.

This paper describes novel globin X genes from several
vertebrates and invertebrates. The classification of these
genes as globin X is confirmed by molecular phylogeny.
Since some nodes in the phylogeny are not well resolved,
and there are some groupings inconsistent with the species tree (e.g. the sequences from the deuterostome Saccoglossus grouping with protostome ones), it would be
worth showing the alignments as a separate figure. In the
alignment members of other globin families should also be
included. This could reveal if the globin X group has some
shared sequence signatures, distinguishing them from
other globins.
The authors should also comment on the putative
amphioxus globin X orthologues described in ref 24. The
tree in Figure 1 indicates that the amphioxus genes
(BflGb3,12,13,14) represent a distinct class, maybe originating at a separate duplication event, predating bilaterian
radiation. BflGb6 is missing from the tree.
Author’s response

Thank you for the insightful comments. Globin
sequences are difficult to align, indeed. We agree that in
such cases it is useful to provide the alignment, which is
now available in phylip format as an additional file 2. The
amphioxus globin BflGb6 was excluded from the analysis
because no globin domain was detected using the normal
mode of SMART. The sequence may be mis-annotated

Reviewer’s report 2: Arcady Mushegian, Stowers Institute
for Medical Research, United States of America

This is an interesting observation of broader-thenexpected distribution of globin X among metazoa, and
of the possible connection between globin X and
ectothermy. It is suitable for publication as a Discovery
Note, with perhaps one clarification. How do we know
what was the ingroup and what was the outgroup, i.e.,
what are X and what are non-X? Apparently, these calls
were made before tree inference, but in principle, the
ultimate orthology assignment can be only done by
examination of the phylogenetic tree. I suspect that the
answer is that globin X sequences were much closer to
each other than to any other globins, and therefore the
extent of the family could be defined without tree mapping - but this was not stated in the manuscript.
