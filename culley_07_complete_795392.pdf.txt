Abstract
Background: RNA viruses have been isolated that infect marine organisms ranging from bacteria
to whales, but little is known about the composition and population structure of the in situ marine
RNA virus community. In a recent study, the majority of three genomes of previously unknown
positive-sense single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses were assembled from reverse-transcribed wholegenome shotgun libraries. The present contribution comparatively analyzes these genomes with
respect to representative viruses from established viral taxa.
Results: Two of the genomes (JP-A and JP-B), appear to be polycistronic viruses in the proposed
order Picornavirales that fall into a well-supported clade of marine picorna-like viruses, the
characterized members of which all infect marine protists. A temporal and geographic survey
indicates that the JP genomes are persistent and widespread in British Columbia waters. The third
genome, SOG, encodes a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is related to the
RdRp of viruses in the family Tombusviridae, but the remaining SOG sequence has no significant
similarity to any sequences in the NCBI database.
Conclusion: The complete genomes of these viruses permitted analyses that resulted in a more
comprehensive comparison of these pathogens with established taxa. For example, in concordance
with phylogenies based on the RdRp, our results support a close homology between JP-A and JPB and RsRNAV. In contrast, although classification of the SOG genome based on the RdRp places
SOG within the Tombusviridae, SOG lacks a capsid and movement protein conserved within this
family and SOG is thus likely more distantly related to the Tombusivridae than the RdRp phylogeney
indicates.

Background
RNA viruses of every classification have been isolated
from the ocean; nevertheless, the marine RNA virus community remains largely uncharacterized. Although there
are several examples of RNA viruses that infect marine animals [1] these organisms represent a very small portion of

the organisms in the sea; therefore it is unlikely that
viruses infecting these organisms make up a significant
fraction of the natural RNA virioplankton. Marine RNA
phages appear to be rare [2] and thus it is more likely that
the dominant RNA viruses infect the diverse and abundant marine protists. For example, RNA viruses have

recently been isolated that infect a number of marine protists including a diatom [3], a dinoflagellate [4], a
raphidophyte [5], a prasinophyte [6] and a thraustochytrid [7].
Picorna-like viruses are a "superfamily" of positive-sense
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses that have similar
genome features and several conserved protein domains
[8]. Previously, we investigated the diversity of marine
picorna-like viruses by analysis of RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) sequences amplified from marine
virus communities and demonstrated that picorna-like
viruses are present and persistent in a diversity of marine
environments [9]. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses
showed that none of the environmental sequences fell
within established virus families.
In a recent study, reverse-transcribed whole-genome shotgun libraries were used to characterize two marine RNA
virus communities [10]. Positive-sense ssRNA viruses that
are distant relatives of known RNA viruses dominated the
libraries. One RNA virus library (JP) was characterized by
a diverse, monophyletic clade of picorna-like viruses, but
the second library (SOG) was dominated by viruses distantly related to members of the family Tombusviridae and
the genus Umbravirus. Moreover, in both libraries, a high
percentage of sequence fragments were part of only a few
contiguous segments of sequence (contigs). Specifically,
in the SOG sample 59% of the sequence fragments
formed a single contig. Similarly, 66% of JP sequence fragments contributed to only four contigs that represented
two viral genomes. Using a RT-PCR-based approach to
increase the amount of sequence for each dominant contig resulted in the assembly of three complete viral
genomes. This contribution analyzes these genomes from
three previously unknown marine RNA viruses and investigates their similarities and differences with respect to
representative genotypes from established viral taxa.

Results and Discussion
Jericho Pier site
The two assembled genomes (JP-A and JP-B) from the Jericho Pier sampling site (Figure 1) are single molecules of
linear ssRNA.

The JP-A genome is positive-sense, 9212 nt in length with
a 632 nt 5' untranslated region (UTR) followed by 2 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) of 5067 nt (ORF 1, nt
position 633 to 5699) and 3044 nt (ORF 2, nt position
5848 to 8799) separated by an intergenic region (IGR) of
149 nt (Figure 2A). ORF 2 is followed by a 3' UTR of 413
nt (nt position 8800 to 9212) and a polyadenylate [poly
(A)] tail. The base composition of JP-A is 27.1% A, 19.4%
C, 22.0% G, and 31.6% U; this results in a G+C of 41%, a

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/69

percentage similar to other polycistronic picorna-like
viruses (Table 1).
Comparison to known viral sequences shows that the protein sequence predicted to be encoded by ORF 1 of JP-A
contains conserved sequence motifs characteristic of a
type III viral Helicase (aa residues 430 to 545), a 3C-like
cysteine protease (aa residues 1077 to 1103) and a type I
RdRp (aa residues 1350 to 1591) [11] (Figure 1A).
BLASTp [12] searches of the NCBI database with the predicted ORF 1 protein sequence showed significant
sequence similarities (E value < 0.001) to nonstructural
protein motifs of several viruses, including members of
the families Dicistroviridae (Drosophila C virus), Marnaviridae (HaRNAV), Comoviridae (Cowpea mosaic virus)
and the unassigned genus Iflavirus (Kakugo virus). The top
matches for ORF 1 were to RsRNAV [E value = 3 × 10-119,
identities = 302/908 (33%)], a newly sequenced, unclassified positive-sense ssRNA virus that infects the widely
distributed diatom Rhizosolenia setigera [3], HaRNAV [E
value = 2 × 10-32, identities = 156/624 (25%)] and Drosophila C virus [E value = 1 × 10-29, identities = 148/603
(24%)], a positive-sense ssRNA virus that infects fruit flies.
Comparison of the protein sequence predicted to be
encoded by ORF 2 of JP-A to known viral sequences shows
that it has significant similarities to the structural proteins
of viruses from the families Dicistroviridae (Drosophila C
virus), Marnaviridae (HaRNAV), and the genus Iflavirus
(Varroa destructor virus 1). The sequences that are most
similar to ORF 2 of JP-A were the structural protein
regions of RsRNAV [E value = 6 × 10-78, identities = 212/
632 (33%)], HaRNAV [E value = 6 × 10-68, identities =
187/607 (30%)] and SssRNAV [E value = 2 × 10-49, identities = 241/962 (25%)].
The JP-B RNA genome is also likely from a positive-sense
ssRNA virus. The 8839 nt genome consists of a 5' UTR of
774 nt followed by two predicted ORFs of 4842 nt (ORF
1, nt position 775 to 5616) and 2589 nt (ORF 2, nt position 5914 to 8502) separated by an IGR of 298 nt (nt position 5617 to 5913) (Figure 2B). The 3' UTR is 337 nt long
and followed by a poly (A) tail. The base composition of
the genome is A, 30.8%; C, 17.9%; G, 19.7%; U, 31.6%.
Like JP-A, this % G+C value of 38% is comparable to the
% G+C observed in other polycistronic picorna-like
viruses (Table 1).
The position of core sequence motifs conserved among
positive-sense ssRNA viruses and BLAST searches of the
NCBI database with the translated JP-B genome suggest
that nonstructural proteins are encoded by ORF1, and the
structural proteins are encoded by ORF2. We identified
conserved sequence motifs in ORF 1 characteristic of a
type III viral Helicase (aa residues 328 to 441), a 3C-like
cysteine protease (aa residues 882 to 909) and a type I

RdRp (aa residues 1143 to 1408) [11] (Figure 2B).
BLASTp [12] searches of the GenBank database showed
that ORF 1 has significant similarities (E value < 0.001) to
nonstructural genes from positive-sense ssRNA viruses
from a variety of families, including the Comoviridae
(Peach rosette mosaic virus), Dicistroviridae (Taura syndrome virus), Marnaviridae (HaRNAV), Sequiviridae (Rice
tungro spherical virus) and Picornaviridae (Avian encephalomyelitis virus). The top scoring sequences [E value = 2
× 10-69, identities = 232/854 (27%)] were to a RdRp
sequence from RsRNAV and a partial picorna-like virus
RdRp from an unidentified virus [E value = 2 × 10-40, identities = 85/150 (56%)] amplified from the same JP station
during an earlier study [9]. Significant similarities to ORF
2 include the structural genes of viruses from the families
Dicistroviridae (Rhopalosiphum padi virus), Marnaviridae
(HaRNAV) and Picornaviridae (Human parechovirus 2), as
well as the unclassified genus Iflavirus (Ectropis obliqua
picorna-like virus). The top scoring sequences were to the
capsid protein precursor regions of RsRNAV [E value = 9 ×
10-88, identities = 244/799 (30%)] and HaRNAV [E value
= 8 × 10-60, identities = 180/736(24%)] and SssRNAV [E
value = 1 × 10-40. identities = 156/588 (26%)].

The JP-A and JP-B genomes appear to have a polycistronic
genome organization similar to that found in viruses in
the family Dicistroviridae. Several of these viruses contain
internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) [13-16] that position
the ribosome on the genome, actuating translation initiation even in the absence of known canonical initiation
factors [13]. For example, TSV, a marine dicistrovirus, has
an IRES located in the IGR that directs the synthesis of the
structural proteins [15]. Computational searches did not
identify the secondary structure elements characteristic of
dicistrovirus IGR-IRESs in the JP genomes [16,17], however, JP-A and JP-B genomes have extensive predicted secondary structure in the 5' UTRs and IGRs [18,19],
suggestive of an IRES function. Moreover, start codons in
a favorable Kozak context, i.e. conserved sequences
upstream of the start codon that are thought to play a role
in initiation of translation [20], were not found in the JP
genomes. However to unequivocally demonstrate IRES
elements in the JP genomes, they must be confirmed
experimentally in polycistronic constructs. Nevertheless,
it seems reasonable that JP-A and JP-B use similar mechanisms to initiate translation of the ORF 2 genes as are
known to be employed by several dicistroviruses.
We used RT-PCR to assess the distribution and persistence
of the JP-A and JP-B viruses in situ. Amplification with specific primers that target each of these viruses occurred in
samples from throughout the Strait of Georgia, the West
coast of Vancouver Island, and in every season and tidal
state at Jericho pier (Figure 1, Table 2). These results suggest that JP-A and JP-B are ubiquitous in the coastal waters
of British Columbia.
It has long been recognized that several other groups of
small, positive-sense ssRNA viruses share many characteristics with viruses in the family Picornaviridae. Recently,
Christian et al. [8] proposed creating an order (the Picornavirales) of virus families (Picornaviridae, Dicistroviridae,
Marnaviridae, Sequiviridae and Comoviridae) and unassigned genera (Iflavirus, Cheravirus, and Sadwavirus) that
have picornavirus-like characteristics. Viruses in the proposed order have genomes with a protein covalently
attached to the 5' end, a 3' poly (A) tail, a conserved order
of non-structural proteins (Helicase-VpG-ProteinaseRdRp), regions of high sequence similarity in the helicase,
proteinase and RdRp, post translational protein processing during replication, an icosahedral capsid with a
unique "pseudo-T3" symmetry, and only infect eukaryotes.
Although the capsid morphology, presence of a 5' terminal protein and replication strategy and hosts are
unknown, signature genomic features and phylogenetic
analyses suggest that the JP viruses fall within the proposed order Picornavirales. Both JP genomes encode the

also provide strong support for a clade comprised of
viruses (HaRNAV, RsRNAV and SssRNAV) that infect
marine protists and the JP-A and JP-B viruses. Within this
clade, RsRNAV, JP-A and JP-B have the most characteristics in common. For example, they have the same order of
structural and non-structural genes, they are polycistronic
and the phylogenetic analyses indicate they are more
closely related (Figures 3 and 4). Whether JP-A and JP-B
infect host organisms related to Rhizosolenia setigera
remains unclear, although because of the inclusion of the
JP genomes within this clade and the fact that protists are
the most abundant eukaryotes in the sea, we suggest that
both JP viruses likely have a protist host.
Strait of Georgia site
The SOG genome was assembled from the Strait of Georgia metagenomic library, and subsequently completed as
described in Methods. The genome has features characteristic of a positive-sense ssRNA virus. The genome is 4449
nt long and comprised of a 5' UTR of 334 bp followed by
three putative ORFs (nt position 335–1228, nt position
1385–2860 and nt position 2903–4228) and is terminated with a 3' UTR of 221 nt. A poly (A) tail was not
detected. Another putative ORF located at nt position 49
to 783 is in an alternative reading frame relative to the
ORFs discussed above (Figure 2C). The G+C content of
the SOG genome is 52%.

We identified the eight conserved motifs of the RdRp [11]
in the SOG genome (aa residues pos 451 to 700) (Figure
2C). tBLASTx [12] searches with the remainder of the
genome sequence showed no significant matches (E value
< 0.001) to sequences in the NCBI database (including the

five environmental metagenomes that have been deposited). BLASTp searches with the putative RdRp sequence
resulted in significant similarities (E value < 0.001) to
RdRp sequences from positive-sense ssRNA viruses from
the family Tombusviridae and the unassigned genus
Umbravirus. The sequence with the most similarity to SOG
was from Olive latent virus 1 [E value = 3 × 10-66, identities = 180/508 (35%)]. This virus belongs to the genus
Necrovirus in the family Tombusviridae that has a host
range restricted to higher plants [22]. SOG is also significantly similar to the Carrot mottle mimic virus sequence
[E value = 6 × 10-66, identities = 178/492 (36%)], a member of the unclassified genus Umbravirus whose known
members infect only flowering plants [23].
Although the SOG putative RdRp sequence has similarity
to the RdRp of viruses from the family Tombusviridae and
genus Umbravirus, the remaining SOG sequence has no
detectable similarity to any other known sequence. A
Bayesian maximum likelihood tree based on alignments
of the SOG RdRp with the available Umbravirus sequences
and representative members of the Tombusviridae indicates that the SOG genome forms a well supported clade
(Bayesian clade support value of 100) with the single
member of the genus Avenavirus, OCSV (Figure 5). Additionally, the presence of an amber stop codon (nt position
1230–1232) at the end of ORF 1 of the SOG genome (Figure 2C), resembles the in-frame termination codon characteristic of the replicase gene of viruses in 7 of the 8
genera of the Tombusviridae [24]. This division of the replicase of the Tombusviridae by a termination codon is
thought to be part of a translational read though gene
expression strategy [24]. Other similarities to the Tombus-

viridae include a similar genome size, the absence of an
obvious helicase motif and the 5' proximal relative position of the RdRp within the genome [22]. However,
unlike viruses in the Tombusviridae, there is no recognizable sequence for conserved movement or capsid proteins
in the SOG genome. The absence of a recognizable movement protein could indicate the SOG virus does not infect
a higher plant. Our inability to identify structural genes
may indicate that, like the umbraviruses, the SOG virus
does not encode capsid proteins. However, it is also possible that movement or structural proteins encoded in the
SOG genome have no sequence similarity to those currently in the NCBI database.

genomes of these marine RNA viruses that we propose to
infect single-celled eukaryotes may be more similar to the
ancestral RNA viruses that gave rise to those that infect
higher organisms.

Conclusion

The locations of the stations where one or both of the JP
genomes were detected are shown in Figure 2. Details for
each station are listed in Table 2. In summary, samples
were collected from sites throughout the Strait of Georgia,
including repeated sampling from the JP site during different seasons, and from the West coast of Vancouver Island
in Barkley Sound.

Our analyses suggest that a persistent, widespread and
possibly dominant population of novel polycistronic
picorna-like viruses is an important component of the
RNA virioplankton in coastal waters. Nevertheless, as
exemplified by the SOG genome from the Strait of Georgia site, other marine RNA virus assemblages appear to
contain viruses whose detectable sequence similarity with
established groups of viruses is limited to only the most
conserved genes (i.e. RdRp). The novelty of JP-A, JP-B and
SOG, as revealed by sequence analyses and genome characterization, suggests that most of the diversity in the
marine RNA virus community remains uncharacterized.
Furthermore, these results raise the hypothesis that the

(Millipore, Cambridge, Canada), to remove particulates
larger than most viruses. This filtrate was subsequently
concentrated approximately 200 fold through a Tangential Flow Filter cartridge (Millipore) with a 30 kDa molecular cut-off, essentially concentrating the 2 to 450 nm size
fraction of seawater. Remaining bacteria were removed by
filtering the concentrate two times through a 0.22 μm
Durapore PVDF membrane (Millipore). Virus-sized particles in each VC were pelleted via ultracentrifugation (5 h
at 113 000 × g at 4°C). Pellets were resuspended overnight
at 4°C in sterile 50 μM Tris chloride (pH 7.8).
Whole genome library construction
A detailed description of the whole genome shotgun
library construction protocol can be found in Culley et al.
[10]. Briefly, before extraction, concentrated viral lysates
were treated with RNase (Roche, Mississauga, Canada)
and then extracted with a QIAamp Minelute Virus Spin Kit
(Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot of each extract was used in
a PCR reaction with universal 16S primers to ensure samples were free of bacteria. To isolate the RNA fraction,
samples were treated with DNase 1 (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) and used as templates for reverse transcription with random hexamer primers. Double-stranded (ds)
cDNA fragments were synthesized from single stranded
DNA with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitro-

gen) using nick translational replacement of genomic
RNA [26]. After degradation of overhanging ends with T4
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), adapters were attached to
the blunted products with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen).
Subsequently, excess reagents were removed and cDNA
products were separated by size with a Sephacryl column
(Invitrogen). To increase the amount of product for cloning, size fractions greater than 600 bp were amplified with
primers targeting the adapters. Products from each PCR
reaction were purified and cloned with the TOPO TA
Cloning system (Invitrogen). Clones were screened for
inserts by PCR with vector-specific primers. Insert PCR
products greater than 600 bp were purified and sequenced
at the University of British Columbia's Nucleic Acid and
Protein Service Facility (Vancouver, Canada). Sequence
fragments were assembled into overlapping segments
using Sequencher v 4.5 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, U.S.A.)
based on a minimum match % of 98 and a minimum bp
overlap of 20. Sequences were compared against the NCBI
database with tBLASTx [12]. A sequence was considered
significantly similar if BLAST E values were < 0.001. The
details for viruses used in phylogenetic analyses are listed
in additional file 2. Virus protein sequences were aligned
using CLUSTAL X v 1.83 with the Gonnet series protein
matrix [27]. Alignments were transformed into likelihood
distances with Mr. Bayes v3.1.1 [21] and 250,000 generations. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed with PAUP

The standard PCR conditions were reactions with 1 U of
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in 1× Platinum Taq buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP,
and 0.2 μM of each primer (see Additional file 1), in a
final volume of 50 μl. Thermocycler conditions were, activation of the enzyme at 94°C for 1 min 15 s, followed by
30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at
50°C for 45s and extension at 72°C for 1 minute. The
reaction was terminated after a final extension stage of 5
min at 72°C. PCR products were purified with a PCR Minelute cleanup kit (Qiagen) and sequenced directly with
both primers.

v4.0 [28], and bootstrap values calculated based on percentages of 10,000 replicates.
5' and 3' RACE
The 5' and 3' ends of the environmental viral genomes
were cloned using the 5' and 3' RACE systems (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer's instructions. The 3' RACE
with the SOG genome required the addition of a poly (A)
tract with poly (A) polymerase (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer directions before cDNA synthesis. cDNA
was synthesized directly from extracted viral RNA from
the appropriate library. Three clones of each 5' and 3' end
were sequenced.

Environmental screening
To assess the temporal and geographic distribution of the
JP genomes, extracted RNA from viral concentrates were
screened with Superscript III One-step RT-PCR System
with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) with
primers JP-A 5 and 6 and JP-B 6 and 7 (see Additional file
1). The template for the reactions was DNase 1 treated
viral RNA, extracted with a QIAamp Minelute Virus Spin
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Each reaction consisted of RNA template, 1× reaction mix,
0.2 μM of each primer, 1 μl RT/Platinum Taq mix in a volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated 30 min at 50°C,
then immediately heated to 94°C for 45 s, followed by 35
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, annealing at 50°C
for 30 s and extension at 68°C for 1 min. After a final
extension step at 68°C for 5 min, RT-PCR products were
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Products were
sequenced to verify the correct target had been amplified.

Closing gaps in the assembly
PCR with primers targeting specific regions of the two JP
environmental genomes were used to verify the genome
assembly, increase sequencing coverage and reconfirm the
presence of notable genome features. The template for
these reactions was the amplified and purified PCR product from the JP and SOG shotgun libraries. Additional file
1 lists the sequence and genome position of primers used.
