Abstract

Background

from model organism protein-interaction datasets [7,8].
To transfer information on gene function between two
genomes requires the identification of orthologous genes in
the two genomes (that is, genes that are descended from a
common ancestor and share biological functions). However,
the identification of gene orthologs is often not a trivial problem; gene duplications can result in a single gene having multiple potential orthologs in a second species. In addition, it is

Physical interactions between proteins underpin most biological processes. For this reason, large-scale protein-interaction
mapping projects have been initiated in several model organisms [1-6]. Unfortunately, projects of a similar scale have not
yet been described for mammalian systems, with the result
that our global understanding of protein function remains
less advanced in mammals than in lower eukaryotes. However, many physical interactions are conserved between species, so it should be possible to infer information about

Results: Here we describe a network of over 70,000 predicted physical interactions between
around 6,200 human proteins generated using the data from lower eukaryotic protein-interaction
maps. The physiological relevance of this network is supported by its ability to preferentially
connect human proteins that share the same functional annotations, and we show how the network
can be used to successfully predict the functions of human proteins. We find that combining
interaction datasets from a single organism (but generated using independent assays) and combining
interaction datasets from two organisms (but generated using the same assay) are both very
effective ways of further improving the accuracy of protein-interaction maps.

Background: Protein-interaction maps are powerful tools for suggesting the cellular functions of
genes. Although large-scale protein-interaction maps have been generated for several invertebrate
species, projects of a similar scale have not yet been described for any mammal. Because many
physical interactions are conserved between species, it should be possible to infer information
about human protein interactions (and hence protein function) using model organism proteininteraction datasets.

necessary to distinguish true gene orthologs from 'out-paralogs' (that is, genes that arose from a gene-duplication event
before the divergence of two species, and so are unlikely to
share functions) [9]. One method that addresses both these
problems is the InParanoid algorithm, which first identifies
potential orthologs by best pairwise similarity searches, and
then clusters these orthologs into groups of likely coorthologs, with each ortholog assigned a score representing
the confidence that it is the main ortholog [9]. We have used
the orthology relationships identified by the InParanoid algorithm to construct a putative human protein-interaction map
based solely on high-throughput interaction datasets from
model organisms. We show that this approach successfully
identifies functionally related human proteins, and so can be
used to assign putative functions to many novel human genes.
The resulting network provides a framework for human biology and acts as a guide for a future experimental human protein-interaction mapping project.

Results
Generation of a human protein-interaction map
Protein interactions are often evolutionarily conserved
between orthologous proteins from different species [7].
Hence we reasoned that a human protein-interaction map
could be constructed using data from model organism protein-interaction mapping projects. We obtained the data from
seven experimental and four computationally predicted protein-interaction maps from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [14,10,11], Drosophila melanogaster [5] and Caenorhabditis
elegans [6]. For each interacting protein, we identified potential human orthologs using the InParanoid algorithm [9]. A
human protein interaction is predicted if both interaction
partners from a model organism have one or more human
orthologs. Using this strategy, we were able to generate a
human interaction network comprising 71,496 interactions
between 6,231 human proteins. The sources of these predicted interactions are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1a,
and all the interactions are available in Additional data file 1
available online with this article and can also be searched or
downloaded from our website [12].

Assessment of the accuracy of the interaction datasets
In the absence of a comprehensive set of verified human protein interactions, we required another method to assess the
accuracy of the interaction network. Proteins that interact
physiologically are expected to have related functions. Therefore high-quality interaction datasets should predict a greater
proportion of interactions between functionally related proteins than low quality datasets. The functions of human proteins can be systematically described using the Gene
Ontology (GO) annotations [13] available from Ensembl [1417]. GO annotations provide a hierarchical description of gene
functions with general functions described by GO annotations at the top levels of the hierarchy and very precise functions described by terms deeper in the hierarchy. Because

The table lists the total number of interactions predicted by each
interaction dataset, and the number of these interactions that connect
proteins that share at least one GO term (at level 3 or deeper in the
GO hierarchy). The percentages are relative to the total number of
non-self interactions where both proteins have at least one GO
annotation. All, all predicted human protein interactions; Yeast/worm/
fly, interactions predicted by the yeast, worm or fly interaction maps;
All core, all interactions predicted by the high-confidence subsets of
each model organism interaction map (see Materials and methods);
Two species, interactions predicted by more than one model organism
interaction map; Two species (core), interactions predicted by the
high-confidence subset of interactions from more than one model
organism; Two methods, interactions predicted by data derived from
more than one different interaction assay; Random pairs, the data for a
randomly generated interaction network.

physiologically interacting proteins are expected to have
related, but non-identical functions, they are expected to
share some, but not all GO annotations. Therefore, one
method to evaluate an interaction dataset is to count the proportion of interactions that connect proteins that share common GO terms [5]. For the complete predicted human
interaction network, 25% of interaction partners share at
least one GO term, which is many more than observed with a
randomly generated network of the same size (15% of interactions). To confirm that this result did not just apply to quite
general GO annotations, we calculated the proportion of
interaction partners that share GO annotations at depths 3 to
8 and greater than 8 in the GO hierarchy. We found that the
predicted interaction network preferentially connects proteins that share GO annotations at any level of the GO hierarchy (see Figure 2). This suggests that the interaction network
indeed preferentially connects functionally related human
proteins.

We then used the same strategy to compare the accuracy of
human interactions predicted by data from the three different

candidate human protein interactions. As shown in Table 1
and Figure 2a, interactions predicted by the complete yeast
and worm datasets are slightly better at connecting functionally related human proteins than those predicted by the fly
dataset, suggesting that these interactions can be considered
with higher confidence. This result is especially interesting
given that the yeast interaction map is an order of magnitude
larger than the fly or worm maps, confirming that the fly and
worm interaction maps currently have a relatively low
coverage.
Next we asked how the confidence in the assignment of gene
orthologs affects the accuracy of an interaction. For each predicted interaction, an orthology confidence score was calculated by summing the InParanoid orthology confidence
scores for the two human and two model organism proteins
(see Materials and methods). Of the predicted interactions,
24,897 have the maximum possible confidence score of 4. Of
these interactions, 28%, 24% and 13% connect proteins that
share GO terms at depths of 3, 5 or 7 in the GO hierarchy
(excluding proteins without GO annotation). In contrast, for
interactions with an orthology confidence score less than 4,
these figures are 24%, 20% and 10%. Hence we conclude that
the predicted human interactions with high-confidence
orthology assignments can be considered more reliable than
those interactions with less confidence in their orthology
assignments. This confirms that the confidence scores
assigned using InParanoid are indeed likely to be useful predictors of functional conservation.

A core dataset of high-confidence protein interactions
The worm and fly interaction mapping projects both defined
a subset of high-confidence 'core' interactions that have the
greatest experimental support (Figure 1b). For the worm
interaction map these were defined as interactions identified
more than once, or that reconfirmed when retested in the
two-hybrid assay [6]. In the fly interaction map each interaction has an associated confidence score, and interactions with
a score greater than 0.5 are considered core interactions (the
interaction score mainly depends upon the number of times
each interaction was detected, the total number of
interactions made by each protein and the local network clustering; see [5]). To generate a similar subset of yeast protein
interactions, we defined core yeast protein interactions as
those identified more than once by any single assay, consistent with previous analyses of the individual datasets [1-3,11].
As shown in Figure 2a and Table 1, for all three species these
core interactions predict a greater proportion of human interactions that share GO terms than the total datasets. Indeed all
three core interaction maps are of similar accuracy, so we
combine their predicted interactions into a core network of
11,487 higher-confidence human protein interactions (summarized in Table 2 and available as Additional data file 2). Of
these core interactions, 38%, 35% and 24% connect proteins
that share GO terms at depths of 3, 5 or 7 in the GO hierarchy
(excluding proteins with no GO annotations).

The complete network consists of all human protein interactions
predicted by model organism protein-interaction datasets. The core
network consists of all the human interactions predicted by the highconfidence subsets of each interaction network (see Materials and
methods). Novel genes are defined as those without GO annotations.
Disease genes are defined by the OMIM database [25], available from
Ensembl [16].

Combining interaction datasets to generate highconfidence networks
It has been shown previously that protein interactions
detected by more than one high-throughput interaction assay
are more accurate [11]. We find that this is also true for
human protein interactions predicted by yeast protein interactions detected by more than one method (see Figure 2b and
Table 1). It has also been suggested that protein interactions
are more likely to represent physiologically important interactions if they have been detected between orthologous protein pairs from two or more species [7,18]. To test this
hypothesis we identified 288 human protein interactions predicted by interactions in two or more model organisms (Figure 1, Table 1). Remarkably, 75%, 70% and 56% of these
interactions share GO terms at depths of 3, 5 or 7 in the GO
hierarchy, respectively (Figure 2b). Indeed, for interactions
derived from core interaction datasets, these figures rise to
88%, 80% and 67% of interactions. Hence, protein interactions predicted by data from multiple species can be considered with very high confidence.

Using the interaction network to predict human gene
function
Because physiologically interacting proteins often have similar functions (Figure 2), it should be possible to predict the
functions of a novel human protein if it interacts with proteins of known function. To address how well our interaction
map could be used for this purpose, we asked whether the
known GO terms of a protein could be predicted using only
the GO terms of its interaction partners. As shown in Table 3,
GO terms associated with at least one of a gene's core interaction partners predict GO terms associated with that gene with
an accuracy of around 8%. However, GO terms associated
with at least two, three, four or five of a gene's interaction
partners have 22%, 30%, 37%, 42% and 45% probabilities,
respectively, of also being associated with that gene (Table 3).
Although these values may vary for different GO terms, as
shown in Additional data file 3, the accuracy and coverage of
these GO term predictions are very similar for GO terms at

We report here the use of data from model organism proteininteraction mapping projects to predict a network of human
protein interactions. This network consists of over 70,000
interactions that connect over one-third of all the predicted
human proteins, including 1,482 proteins of unknown function and 448 proteins encoded by human disease genes. The
physiological relevance of this network is supported by its
ability to preferentially connect human proteins that share
biological functions (Figure 2). Indeed the network can be
successfully used to predict the functions of a gene using the
known functions of its interaction partners (Table 3). As such,
the network should provide a rich source of functional
hypotheses for researchers interested in the functions of one
or many human proteins.

refereed research

For the identification of gene orthologs, we used the InParanoid algorithm. InParanoid offers several important benefits
compared to simple 'reciprocal best hit' sequence-similarity
searches [9]. First, many genes from lower eukaryotes have
multiple co-orthologs in humans, which can be identified
using InParanoid, but not by simple one-to-one sequencesimilarity searches. Second, InParanoid can successfully distinguish these true co-orthologs from paralogs that arose
before a speciation event (which are unlikely to retain similar
functions). Finally, each potential ortholog in a group of coorthologs identified by InParanoid has an associated score
that represents the likelihood that it is the main ortholog of a
gene. We have summed these confidence scores to provide an
orthology confidence score for each predicted human protein
interaction in our network. These high-confidence ortholog

deposited research

The ability to provide a reasonably accurate prediction of a
gene's GO terms means that we can use the interaction network to provide probabilistic gene function predictions for
novel human proteins and also to predict additional functions
for proteins with some known functions. The core interaction
map contains 864 proteins with no functional annotations.
About 10% of these proteins interact with two or more proteins that share GO terms. The probabilistic predictions of the
functions of these novel proteins are listed in Additional data
file 4. Often these predicted functions are also supported by
the known functions of the protein domains predicted to be
encoded by these novel genes (see Additional data file 4). For
example, ENSG00000028310 encodes a bromodomain and
interacts with six proteins annotated as 'GO:0006355 regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent', ENSG00000080608
encodes an RNA-binding domain and interacts with five proteins annotated as 'GO:0006364 rRNA processing', and
ENSG00000104863 encodes a PDZ domain and interacts
with three proteins with the annotations 'GO:0005887 integral to plasma membrane, GO:0007242 intracellular signaling cascade' (Additional data file 4). The complete and core

different levels in the GO hierarchy, and so can be used as an
approximate indication of the confidence in a prediction of
gene function. Hence the network can be used to predict GO
terms for a human gene of unknown function, with the
approximate confidence in the GO prediction determined by
the number of interaction partners that share the GO term.

The accuracy and coverage of the interactions predicted in
this network depend primarily on two parameters: the quality
of the original model organism interaction datasets; and the
ability to identify the human orthologs of a model organism
protein. Our analysis suggests that the raw yeast and worm
protein-interaction datasets are currently slightly more accurate than the raw fly interaction dataset, but that when filtered for high-confidence interactions the three interaction
maps are of very similar accuracy (see Table 1 and Figure 2).
The fly and worm interaction maps both have a much lower
coverage than the yeast interaction network, most probably
because they both only represent the results of a single interaction-mapping project. The continuation of these model
organism protein-interaction mapping projects to generate
higher coverage interaction maps will greatly enhance our
ability to predict human protein interactions.

reviews

The approximate accuracy and coverage of GO term predictions were
calculated for every gene in the core or complete interaction networks
with at least one known GO term. The GO terms of a gene are
predicted using the GO terms of any of its interaction partners (1+), or
GO terms shared by at least two to six of its interaction partners (2+
to 6+). Accuracy is calculated as the number of correctly predicted GO
terms divided by the total number of predicted GO terms. Coverage is
calculated as the number of correctly predicted GO terms divided by
the total number of known GO terms associated with each gene. These
values are similar for GO annotations at different levels of the GO
hierarchy (see Additional data file 3).

interactions connect a greater proportion of functionally
related human proteins, suggesting that the InParanoid confidence score is indeed a useful tool for predicting the likely
physiological relevance of a predicted protein interaction.
The ability to successfully predict human protein functions
using the results of model organism protein-interaction mapping projects highlights both the relevance of model organism
protein-interaction mapping projects to understanding
human biology and also the benefits that would result from an
experimental human protein-interaction mapping project.
Although the interaction network can currently accurately
predict only a subset of the known functions of a gene, this
should improve as more protein-interaction data becomes
available. For this reason, we strongly encourage the continuation of model organism protein-interaction mapping
projects.

Methods of verifying protein-interaction datasets
We also assessed the relative merits of three different methods to improve the accuracy of protein-interaction maps. The
first strategy is to define a subset of interactions detected
more than once with a single assay [1-3,6]. We found that this
approach leads to an approximately 1.5- to 2.7-fold increase
in the proportion of predicted human interactions that share
GO terms (Figure 2b). The second strategy is to define a subset of interactions that have been identified by more than one
interaction assay. This results in around a 2.3- to 8-fold
improvement in the prediction of associations between proteins that share GO terms (Figure 2b). The final strategy is to
define a subset of interactions that are predicted by interactions from more than one model organism, which results in
around a 3- to 12-fold improvement in the proportion of
interactions between proteins sharing GO terms (Figure 2b).
With all these filtering methods, the greatest improvements
are seen when considering the proportion of interactions that
share GO terms deep within the GO hierarchy; that is, the filtering steps dramatically improve the proportion of interactions between proteins with very closely related functions. We
conclude that using interaction data derived from a second
interaction assay or from a second species both represent
excellent methods to improve the accuracy of protein-interaction maps. Because of the small number of protein-interaction assays that have been adapted to a high-throughput
format, we suggest that constructing a second interaction
map in a related organism using the same assay may be an
efficient way to produce a high-confidence interaction map.
This strategy is somewhat similar to using phylogenetic footprinting to identify functional noncoding DNA, so we suggest
it should be named 'interaction footprinting'. Using the relatively low-coverage model organism interaction datasets
currently available, only a small proportion of interactions
can be verified by interaction footprinting. The continuation
of these model organism interaction mapping projects will
not only provide a much richer framework of predicted

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R63

human protein interactions, but will also allow many more
interactions to be verified using the interaction footprinting
strategy. However, such an approach will be limited to providing information on those proteins and interactions that
are conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates.

Strategies for completing the human interaction map
The interactions described here provide a first-draft human
protein-interaction map that can be used to predict interactions and functions for genes of interest to a particular
researcher. However, the map also provides a framework
from which a complete human protein-interaction map could
be generated. Firstly, the map could be used to identify subsets of high-confidence, evolutionarily conserved interactions
from the results of large- or medium-scale human interaction-mapping projects. For example the map verifies 51 of
296 yeast two-hybrid interactions detected for human proteins involved in mRNA decay [19]. Alternatively, the
interactions predicted here could be directly experimentally
validated using an assay that allows rapid testing of binary
interactions (such as the yeast or mammalian two-hybrid
assays [20] or protein fragment complementation assays
[21]). This would represent a cost-effective strategy to produce a high-confidence human protein-interaction map
because it massively reduces the number of candidate interactions that need to be tested. Finally, the map identifies
17,300 (23,531 - 6,231) human genes for which no protein
interactions are predicted from model organism interaction
datasets. Many of these proteins are likely to be vertebrate- or
mammalian-specific, and are the most logical choices for bait
proteins for the discovery phase of an experimental human
protein-interaction mapping project.

Materials and methods
Model organism protein-interaction datasets
The interaction datasets used to generate the draft human
protein-interaction network were two-hybrid-based interaction maps for D. melanogaster [5] and C. elegans [6] and a
list of S. cerevisiae protein-interactions compiled by Von
Mering et al. [11] from two two-hybrid [1,2], two complex
purification [3,4], one genetic [10], and four in silico-predicted interaction datasets (which used correlated mRNA
expressions, conserved gene neighbourhood, gene co-occurrence or gene fusion events to predict protein interactions
[11]). Table 4 shows the number of unique interactions in
each dataset, the methods used to generate each dataset, and
the URLs from which the datasets were obtained.

Identification of gene orthologs and construction of the
interaction network
The human orthologs of yeast, worm and fly genes were identified using the InParanoid algorithm, which is designed to
distinguish true orthologs from out-paralogs that arose from
gene duplications before the divergence of two species [9].
The InParanoid algorithm first identifies potential orthologs

The table lists the total number of interactions contained in each model
organism dataset, together with the method used to identify
interactions, the publication reference, and the website (URL) from
which the interaction dataset was obtained. For each dataset, the nonredundant number of unique interactions between unambiguously
identified proteins is shown. For the yeast interactions, the total
number of interactions is shown, as well as the number of interactions
identified using each detection method. In silico only are interactions
only predicted by in silico methods without any confirmation from the
experimental datasets.

Human GOs (at levels 3 or deeper in the GO hierarchy) were
obtained from Ensembl (v19.34a.1) [14,15] using Ensmart
(v19.1) [16,17]. The GO terms 'unknown molecular function/
biological process/cellular compartment' were discarded in
all subsequent analyses. To validate the accuracy of the interaction data, we calculated the percentage of interactions that
shared at least one GO term. To confirm that the results did
not just apply to very general GO annotations, we calculated
the proportion of interacting proteins that shared a GO annotation at levels 3 to 8 and greater than 8 in the GO hierarchy.
For all of these analyses we ignored proteins with no associated GO annotations. Moreover, self-interactions were
excluded because they will always share GO terms and so bias
the results.

Additional data files

The following additional data files are available with the
online version of this article: Additional data file 1 contains a
complete list of predicted human protein interactions; this
dataset contains every human protein interaction that is predicted by a protein interaction from any of seven experimental and four computationally-predicted protein interaction
maps from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1-4,10,11], Drosophila
melanogaster [5] and Caenorhabditis elegans [6].

by best pairwise similarity searches, and then clusters these
orthologs into groups of probable co-orthologs, with each
ortholog assigned a score representing the confidence that it
is the main ortholog. For each interaction data source, we
obtained SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL accessions for each interacting protein using the Ensmart data-mining tool [16,17] (for
worm and fly genes) or both SWISS-PROT [22] and a
TrEMBL conversion file kindly provided by Paul Kersey, EBI,
Hinxton, UK (for yeast genes). Potential human orthologs of
these genes were then identified using the pre-computed
InParanoid results (version 2.3, available from [23]), and the
results converted to nonredundant Ensembl (v19.34a.1,
genome assembly NCBI34) gene IDs using Ensmart (v19.1) 1
[16,17]. In total, InParanoid identifies 9,500 human genes
with at least one ortholog in at least one of worm, fly or yeast.
For each potential ortholog in a group of co-orthologs, the
InParanoid algorithm calculates a score that represents the
confidence that it is the main ortholog. In this scoring system,
the main ortholog always receives a score of 1, with the other
co-orthologs receiving scores ranging between 0 and 1, calculated according to their similarity to the main ortholog [9]. As
an indication of the confidence we have in the orthology relationships between a pair of interacting proteins from a model
organism and a predicted pair of interacting human proteins,
we calculate a confidence score by summing the InParanoid
confidence scores for each of the four proteins. Hence, each
interaction has an associated score ranging from 0 to 4 that
represents the confidence that both human proteins represent the main orthologs of the model organism proteins, and
vice versa.

To predict the GO terms of a protein, we identified all the GO
terms associated with x or more of its interaction partners
(where x varied from 1 to 6). To validate the accuracy and coverage of this approach we predicted GO terms for genes that
already have associated GO terms. The accuracy was calculated as the total number of correct GO term predictions
divided by the total number of GO term predictions. The coverage was calculated as the total number of correct GO term
predictions divided by the total number of known GO terms.
This analysis was repeated, but only considering individually
GO terms at depths of 3 to 8 and greater than 8 in the GO hierarchy (see Additional data file 3). To avoid biasing the results
we again ignored self-interactions. For the same reason, we
also only counted once GO terms associated with more than
one interaction partner predicted by the same source interaction from a model organism. The InterPro protein domains
[24] encoded by each human gene were obtained from
Ensembl using Ensmart. Genes of unknown function were
defined as those having no associated GO terms, and disease
genes were as defined by Ensembl using the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database as a reference [25].

Additional data file 2 contains a list of all core human protein
interactions. This represents a subset of high-confidence
human protein interactions that is predicted by model organism protein interactions with greater experimental support.
In the worm interaction map, these are defined as interactions that reconfirmed when retested in the Y2H assay [6]. In
the fly interaction map, each interaction has an associated
confidence score, and interactions with a score greater than
0.5 are considered core interactions (the interaction score
mainly depends upon the number of times each interaction
was detected, the total number of interactions made by each
protein and the local network clustering [5]). To generate a
similar subset of yeast protein interactions, we defined core
yeast protein interactions as those identified more than once
by any single assay. Each entry in the core and complete interaction networks contains the following tab delimited information: Gene 1 Id, Ensembl gene ID for human interaction
partner 1; Gene 1 description, alternative names for human
Gene 1 (from Ensembl); Gene 2 Id, Ensembl gene ID for
human interaction partner 2; Gene 2 description, alternative
names for human Gene 2 (from Ensembl); Source Organism,
the model organism protein interaction dataset that predicts
this human protein interaction; Ortholog 1, model organism
interaction partner 1 from the model organism protein interaction that predicts the human protein interaction; Ortholog
2, model organism interaction partner 2 from the model
organism protein interaction that predicts the human protein
interaction; and Ortholog score, a confidence score for the
human protein interaction based on the likelihood that the
two human proteins are the functional orthologs of the two
model organism proteins. The score ranges from 0 (no confidence) to 4 (high confidence). The score is calculated as the
sum of the Inparanoid confidence scores for each gene
orthology assignment. A score of 4 means that both of the
human genes and both of the model organism genes are all
the main orthologs in their groups of co-orthologs according
to Inparanoid. These represent higher confidence human
protein interactions. Description, this field contains the original annotation for the model organism protein interaction;
for worm interactions this indicates whether the interaction is
in the core dataset of interactions found more than once
(CORE_1), or interactions that reconfirmed when retested
(CORE_2), or non-core interactions that did not reconfirm
(NON_CORE) [6]. For fly interactions this indicates the
interaction score. This score mainly depends upon the
number of times each interaction was detected, the total
number of interactions made by each protein and the local
network clustering, see [5] for details. A score >0.5 is considered high confidence. For yeast protein interactions, these are
the annotations of von Mering et al. [11] and contain the following information: experimental/computation method (and
the number of times the interaction was detected); Von Mering et al.'s confidence assignment; and whether the interaction was previously known in the literature. For more
information, please see [11].
