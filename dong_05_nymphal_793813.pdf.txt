Abstract
Background: Grasshopper serves as important model system in neuroscience, development and
evolution. Representatives of this primitive insect group are also highly relevant targets of pest
control efforts. Unfortunately, the lack of genetics or gene specific molecular manipulation imposes
major limitations to the study of grasshopper biology.
Results: We investigated whether juvenile instars of the grasshopper species Schistocerca
americana are conducive to gene silencing via the systemic RNAi pathway. Injection of dsRNA
corresponding to the eye colour gene vermilion into first instar nymphs triggered suppression of
ommochrome formation in the eye lasting through two instars equivalent to 10–14 days in absolute
time. QRT-PCR analysis revealed a two fold decrease of target transcript levels in affected animals.
Control injections of EGFP dsRNA did not result in detectable phenotypic changes. RT-PCR and
in situ hybridization detected ubiquitous expression of the grasshopper homolog of the dsRNA
channel protein gene sid-1 in embryos, nymphs and adults.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that systemic dsRNA application elicits specific and longterm gene silencing in juvenile grasshopper instars. The conservation of systemic RNAi in the
grasshopper suggests that this pathway can be exploited for gene specific manipulation of juvenile
and adult instars in a wide range of primitive insects.

Background
Including some of the most persistent and devastating
agricultural pests such as the African migratory locust
Schistocerca gregaria, acridid orthopterans represent a
group of insects with significant economic impact and a
target of major research efforts [1-3]. Species of the grasshopper genus Schistocerca serve also as powerful model
system in neurosciences, development and evolution [47]. The development of methods facilitating molecular
manipulation of these primitive insects is thus of wide
interest. However, until now successful approaches for a

specific interference with gene expression have not been
reported. Here we report results from investigating the
conservation of the systemic RNAi pathway in the juvenile
(nymphal) form of the grasshopper species Schistocerca
americana.
RNA interference (RNAi) or the degradation of specific
mRNA species in response to cytosolic presentation of
sequence identical dsRNA molecules is a widespread phenomenon among eukaryotes. Following its discovery in
C.elegans [8], RNAi has been widely adopted as powerful

loss of function gene analysis tool. Components of the
intracellular RNAi pathway machinery like the dsRNA
processing enzyme Dicer, and the RNA induced silencing
complex (RISC) have been found in many eukaryote
model organisms [9]. Less is known yet regarding the conservation of mechanisms facilitating the amplifying and
systemic nature of RNAi in C. elegans. Systemic RNAi
describes the fact that extracellular application of dsRNA
via body cavity injection, soaking, or feeding leads to global and persistent gene silencing in treated individuals
and their progeny [10,11]. The systemic RNA pathway
involves cellular dsRNA uptake and very likely also cellular amplification and release of dsRNA [9].
Recent molecular genetic efforts in C.elegans identified the
systemic RNA interference-deficient-1 (sid-1) gene as essential and sufficient for the systemic induction of RNAi
[12,13]. Sid-1 encodes a seven helix transmembrane protein which has been shown to function as a channel for
the uptake of dsRNA molecules and may also facilitate the
release of dsRNA from cells [13]. Homologs of sid-1 with
the capacity to enhance the systemic uptake of dsRNA
have been reported from humans but not yet from other
organisms [13,14]. However, reports of gene knockdown
following systemic application of dsRNA in phylogenetically distantly related animal species such as flatworms,
annelids and insects suggests that the systemic RNAi pathway is widely conserved [15-18]. In the red flour beetle
Tribolium castaneum for example, injection of dsRNA in
the body cavity of the parental females (parental RNAi) or
final instar larvae (larval RNAi) leads to induction of specific gene silencing in embryos and pupae respectively
[17,18]. Efforts to trigger similar gene silencing effects in
the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have failed [19].
Intriguingly, the lack of systemic RNAi competence correlates with absence of a sid-1 homolog from the Drosophila
genome, while sid-1 homologous sequences are present in
the EST database of the systemic RNAi competent insect
species (see below). Experimental and phylogenetic evidence thus identify sid-1 as a conserved facilitator of systemic RNAi.

Results
Ubiquitous expression of a sid-1 dsRNA channel protein
gene homolog in grasshopper
Considering the causal relationship between sid-1 expression and systemic RNAi competence, we investigated the
presence of sid-1 in Schistocerca. Parts of a sid-1 homologous grasshopper gene (Sa_sid-1) were isolated by degenerate PCR from nymphal cDNA using a set of nested
primer pairs designed against the C-terminal region of sid1, which is strongly conserved between sid-1 of C.elegans
and sid-1 homologous sequences identified in EST databases of human and honey bee (Additional File 1). Subsequent RT-PCR experiments with a single, specific primer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/5/25

combination amplified grasshopper sid-1 from cDNA of
mid-stage embryos, nymphal head or abdomen, and
adult eye, leg and ovaries (Additional File 2). Whole
mount in situ hybridization with a Sa_sid-1 probe against
mid-stage embryos revealed ubiquitous expression at uniform levels (not shown). In combination, these results
demonstrated that grasshopper possesses a homolog of
sid-1, which is expressed in ubiquitous and uniform
manner.
Systemic RNAi induced knockdown of the grasshopper eye
coloration gene vermilion
To be able to test if grasshopper nymphs are conducive to
RNAi mediated gene silencing, we cloned part of the
S.americana ortholog of the Drosophila eye coloration gene
vermilion (Sa_v) (Additional File 3). The v gene encodes
tryptophan oxygenase, which catalyzes the degradation of
tryptophan to kynurenine, the primary substrate of the
ommochrome pigment synthesis pathway [20]. v mutant
Drosophila are characterized by brighter red coloration in
the adult compound eye due to lack of the dark ommochrome pigment and the presence of a second, pteridine
based pigment [21]. Grasshopper compound eyes also
contain red pteridine and dark ommochrome pigments,
which are coexpressed in five vertical stripes (Fig. 1a–e)
[22]. Each stripe is formed during one of the five nymphal
instars. The number of stripes at a given instar thus corresponds to the number of previously completed instars
rendering eye coloration a convenient readout for assaying the temporal dynamics of gene perturbation. Sa_v
dsRNA was prepared by bidirectional in vitro transcription
from template DNA prepared by PCR amplification with
primers targeting the vector internal transcription start
sites. This strategy resulted in 698 bp long dsRNA covering
the entire cloned tryptophane oxygenase open reading
frame region (see Additional File 3). Sa_v dsRNA was
diluted in injection buffer and injected into the dorsal
heart vessel of freshly hatched first instar nymphs. In three
independent injection experiments, stripes one and two,
which are formed during the first and second nymphal
instar, developed a persistent brick-red to light brown coloration in over 15% of injected animals (Table 1). This
coloration contrasted with the dark brown to black color
of the corresponding stripes in control animals and also of
the posterior region of the eye, which is formed earlier
during embryogenesis (compare panels 1a-c with f-h in
Fig. 1). The phenotypically visible reduction of ommochrome formation in first and second eye stripes was
indicative of reduced Sa_v gene activity following dsRNA
injection in the first instar nymph. The persistence of
ommochrome pigmentation in the posterior partition of
the eye was consistent with the known long half life of
ommochrome pigment granules [23].

Without exception, the third stripe formed in Sa_v phenotypic animals emerged in darker coloration than the
stripes one and two, matching the coloration of eye stripes
in non-treated animals at this stage of development (compare panels c and d with panels h and i in Fig. 1). The difference between stripe three and the previously formed
stripes one and two suggested that Sa_v expression
returned to normal levels by beginning of the third instar.
This implied that the duration of Sa_v RNAi mediated
gene knockdown was limited to the first two nymphal
instars, which corresponds to 10 to 14 days under the cul-

ture conditions chosen. Stripes one and two remained
distinct through the fifth nymphal instar (Fig. 1i). Lighter
coloration and a narrower width of stripes one and two
were still noticeable in adult animals suggesting that differentiated retina cells do not or just very slowly replenish
ommochrome content (Fig. 1j).
No additional differences were detected in affected animals besides the transient change in eye coloration. Animals injected with dsRNA covering 300 basepairs of the

Quantitation of systemic RNAi mediated knockdown
efficiency
To confirm the Sa_v gene knockdown and measure its efficacy we investigated the relative levels of v expression in
phenotypic animals by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2). These experiments revealed a two fold decrease of expression levels in
second instar nymphs which rose to a 1.5 fold decrease in
third instar phenotypic nymphs. Consistent with the reinitiation of normal pigmentation in the third stripe of
fourth instar nymphs, Sa_v expression levels at this stage
were not reduced compared to non-treated animals.
Instead, slightly increased expression levels were observed
which may reflect increased transcriptional activation of
Sa_v in response to a high tryptophan titer in the transiently silenced animals. Overall, the course of Sa_v
expression level changes in affected animals was consistent with the time window of eye coloration change.

summary these results demonstrated that a single dsRNA

Discussion
The present study represents the first example of targeted
and specific gene expression manipulation in grasshopper. It takes advantage of the evolutionary conservation of
the systemic RNAi pathway in this species. To demonstrate and investigate efficacy and specificity of this gene
silencing pathway we chose a widely used target gene, the
v encoded tryptophan oxygenase, which catalyzes the first
step in the biosynthesis of ommochrome eye colour pigments. Our results confirm the suitability of the ommochrome synthesis pathway for the evaluation of lack of
function gene manipulation methods [24,25]. Even
though qRT-PCR indicated a remaining 50% of normal
expression levels in affected animals, a resulting change in
eye coloration could be clearly and easily detected in life
animals and monitored over time. The ommochrome biosynthesis pathway thus represents a sensitive and convenient real time readout of gene dose reduction.
Evolutionary conservation, ease of interference and the
normal viability of hypomorphic animals under laboratory conditions render v and the ommochrome pathway a
widely applicable target to evaluate loss gene function
methods in insects.

[26]. These observations implied the existence of dsRNA
uptake mechanisms but indicated limitations in either the
reach of injected dsRNA or the accessibility of different tissues. The present results in grasshopper nymphs demonstrate the induction of gene silencing at far distance from
the entry point of dsRNA injection. Insect tryptophan oxygenase is expressed in many tissues including fat body,
Malpighian tubules, gut and epidermis [23]. The qRT-PCR
data specifically reveal a change of Sa_v expression levels
in tissues of the head. The change of eye coloration, however, is most likely due to the non-autonomous effect of v
activity reduction which leads to a drop of heamolymph
levels of kynurenine, the starting substrate of the ommochrome synthesis pathway. Additional evidence for systemic RNAi competence of a wide range of grasshopper
tissues comes from the observation of ubiquitous expression of sid-1 in embryonic and postembryonic tissues.
Consistent with this, additional experiments in our laboratory targeting cell autonomous eye selector genes result
in specific perturbations of compound eye formation
(Dong&Friedrich, in preparation).

Our data also represent the first demonstration of systemic RNAi induction in the juvenile stage of a primitive
insect. It has been previously reported that localized
application of dsRNA into the cavity of the cercus
appendage in cockroach nymphs silenced target gene
expression in cercal sensory neurons but not in the more
distantly located neurons of the ventral nervous system

The penetrance of systemic RNAi induced v knockdown in
grasshopper is much lower than that reported for honey
bee (95%) and flour beetle (100%) [15,17]. Likewise, the
temporal perdurance of the silencing effect seems shorter
that in honey bee (25 days) and flour beetle (>4 months)
[15,17]. It remains to be explored if these differences are
caused by species specific differences in the systemic RNAi

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/5/25

machinery or technical aspects. The larger body volume of
grasshopper nymphs compared to the juvenile instars of
honey bee and flour beetle is likely to lead to greater dilution of the injected dsRNA. Penetrance and perdurance of
gene knockdown in the grasshopper may be increased by
raising the amounts of injected dsRNA or by improving its
delivery efficiency. The same strategies may also increase
the efficiency of RNAi mediated knockdown which in the
case of Sa_v reached only 50% reduction of transcription
levels. The relationship between mRNA expression levels
and RNAi induced phenotypes has not been quantitatively investigated in insects, which makes it difficult to
compare our results with that in other systems [15,17].
However, it is reasonable to assume that approaching
gene expression levels of heterozygous null mutants may
not yield informative phenotypes with every gene examined. Nonetheless, additional data in our laboratory
reveal that the expression of upstream regulators of grasshopper eye development can be reduced sufficiently
enough to obtain informative phenotypes suggesting
wider applicability (Dong&Friedrich, in preparation).
Furthermore, the detection of sid-1 expression grasshopper ovaries raises the possibility that parental RNAi can be
induced, which may reduce mRNA levels in the embryo
more efficiently.

Methods

Conclusion

Sid-1 expression analysis
Whole mount in situ hybridization to examine the regulation of sid-1 expression in grasshopper embryos at 40% of
development was carried out as described [7]. Life cycle
and tissue specificity of sid-1 expression was determined
by RT-PCR with specific primers (sequences available on
request) on cDNA prepared from embryos at 40% of
development, second instar nymphal head and abdomen,
and adult eye, leg muscle and ovaries. RNA preparations
were obtained by use of the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) followed by DNA removal with Rnase-Free Dnase set
(Quiagen).

Our data demonstrate conservation and expression of the
dsRNA channel protein gene sid-1 in grasshopper, a primitive insect. Consistent with this, systemic application of
dsRNA sequence identical to the grasshopper eye coloration gene v leads to specific, long-term and phenotypically
visible reduction of endogenous grasshopper v gene activity demonstrating the conservation of the systemic RNAi
pathway in grasshopper. In the light of these results we are
confident that the conservation of the systemic RNAi
pathway paves the way for the molecular dissection of
development or neuronal processing in this primitive
insect model system. The systemic RNAi pathway may
also harbour potential for the development of species specific, and hence ecologically friendly pest control
methods.
Based on the conservation of sid-1 in primitive and higher
insects, it is reasonable to assume that the systemic RNAi
pathway is conserved in a wide range of primitive insect
species. Recent reports of parental RNAi induced gene
knockdown in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus and
the two-spotted cricket Gryllus bimaculatus support this
conclusion [27,28]. Nymphal RNAi, the systemic RNAi
induced gene knockdown in juvenile stages of primitive
insects, is therefore likely to develop into a valuable experimental tool analogous to the larval RNAi technique
established for higher insects [17].

Animal culture
Schistocerca americana nymphs were obtained from an in
house laboratory culture maintained as described [7].
Molecular cloning
For RT-PCR cloning experiments, total RNA was isolated
from first instar nymphal heads with the RNAqueous Kit
(Ambion). cDNA template was prepared from total RNA
with random decamer or Oligo(dT) primers using the
RETROscript™ kit (Ambion). Two rounds of PCR amplification were carried out with nested pairs of degenerate
primers targeting conserved gene regions determined by
alignment of published sid-1 homologs from distantly
related species (see Additional data file 1) (primer
sequences available on request). PCR fragments were
cloned into the pGEM-T vector system (Promega) and
plasmid DNA purified with the Perfectprep Plasmid Mini
kit (Eppendorf) for sequencing with the BigDye
Terminator Sequencing kit (Applied BioSystems).
Sequence reads were prepared on an Applied Biosystems
ABI Prism 3700 sequencer in the Applied Genomics Technology Center of Wayne State University. Sequence
analysis and alignments were carried out with MacVector
7.2 (Oxford Molecular Group).

Grasshopper nymphal RNAi
dsRNA was prepared by bidirectional in vitro transcription from PCR templates following published protocols
[17]. Freshly hatched first instar nymphs were immobilized by exposure to -20°C for 15 min. Injection solution
containing 4 µl dsRNA at 5 µg/ul concentration, 0.5 µl 10
× injection buffer (5 mM KCl, 1 mM KPO4) and 0.5 µl
Phenol Red was backfilled into a needle pulled from 10 ul
glass capillary tubes (Idaho Technology). 0.05–0.1 µl of
dsRNA solution was injected into the dorsal midline
between either the third thoracic and the first abdominal
segment or the first and second abdominal segment using
Eppendorf microinjector 5242 and a Leica compound
microscope. Injected individuals were kept in mass culture during the first instar. Phenotypic animals identified

in the second instar were cultured individually until
reaching adulthood.
qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from the head of single individuals as
described above. Primer combinations against grasshopper genes v and armadillo (acc# AF408424), which was
used as normalizer, were designed using the Primer3 software
http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/
primer3_www.cgi (primer sequences available on
request). Optimization and measurement reactions were
carried out using the SYBR green kit (ABgene) and the
Promega Mx3000PTM Real Time PCR system following
manufacturers instructions. Data analysis was done with
the Promega Mx3000PTM Real Time PCR system software
package. For each time point investigated, two phenotypic
individuals were compared to two non-treated animals.
Each bar in Figure 2 represents the average difference of
one experimental animal to two reference animals. Each
animal was represented by three independent reactions.
