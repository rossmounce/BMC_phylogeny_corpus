Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic distribution of large-scale genome structure (i.e. mosaic
compositional patchiness) has been explored mainly by analytical ultracentrifugation of bulk DNA.
However, with the availability of large, good-quality chromosome sequences, and the recently
developed computational methods to directly analyze patchiness on the genome sequence, an
evolutionary comparative analysis can be carried out at the sequence level.
Results: The local variations in the scaling exponent of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis are
used here to analyze large-scale genome structure and directly uncover the characteristic scales
present in genome sequences. Furthermore, through shuffling experiments of selected genome
regions, computationally-identified, isochore-like regions were identified as the biological source
for the uncovered large-scale genome structure. The phylogenetic distribution of short- and largescale patchiness was determined in the best-sequenced genome assemblies from eleven eukaryotic
genomes: mammals (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Canis
familiaris), birds (Gallus gallus), fishes (Danio rerio), invertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans), plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) and yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We found
large-scale patchiness of genome structure, associated with in silico determined, isochore-like
regions, throughout this wide phylogenetic range.
Conclusion: Large-scale genome structure is detected by directly analyzing DNA sequences in a
wide range of eukaryotic chromosome sequences, from human to yeast. In all these genomes,
large-scale patchiness can be associated with the isochore-like regions, as directly detected in silico
at the sequence level.

Background
As soon as genome sequences of sufficient length were
available, three groups [1-3] independently described
powerful methods (power spectra, analysis of fluctuations
in DNA walks) to study large-scale genome structure at
sequence level. The emerging view was the existence of

long-range, power-law correlations, thus pointing to fractal (scale-invariant) structure in DNA sequences. However, such fractal structure, implying the existence of DNA
segments of all sizes, directly clashes with the view of the
genome as composed of long, homogeneous segments
(isochores).

The paradox between a fractal (scale-invariant) or an isochore structure for the genome has been recently solved in
the human genome by the discovery that correlations can
show deviations from the power-law behavior [18]. Interestingly, such deviations can be associated to isochore-like
regions [19] -long-homogeneous genome regions computationally predicted by directly examining the genome
sequence and sharing many compositional and biological
features with true isochores [20-24].
In this way, the phylogenetic distribution of large-scale
genome patchiness can be now explored by analyzing the
deviations of power-law behavior in long-range correlations. The method of choice is Detrended Fluctuation
Analysis or DFA; the deviations from the power-law can
then be revealed by the variations in the local behavior of
the scaling exponent α [18,19]. Here, we determined the
variation of α at different scales in a wide phylogenetic
range of genome sequences. Our analysis clearly distinguishes two characteristic length scales, the larger of
which is demonstrated to be unambiguously associated
with the isochore-like regions, as detected in silico. The
phylogenetic distribution of such patterns leads to
insights in understanding the evolution of genome compositional heterogeneity.

Results
Two characteristic length scales in human DNA
Long-range correlations are detected by log-log plots of
the fluctuation function F(ᐍ) vs. the length scale ᐍ. The
scaling exponent α is then given by the slope of the linear
fit (see Methods). Figures 1 and 2 show how α(ᐍ) profiles
are used to uncover characteristic scales in human DNA
sequences. Significant deviations from the power-law
behavior reveal two main characteristics scales in a large
human sequence contig (chromosome IV, positions
75671304-167795054, 92.1 Mb). The intermediate scale
goes from log10 ᐍ > 1,5 (ᐍ > 30 bp) to log10 ᐍ ≈ 4.5
(ᐍ ≈ 30 kb), while the large scale spans up to log10 ᐍ ≈ 7
(ᐍ ≈ 10 Mb). These values are representative for the entire
human complement, but when the available contigs were
shorter, the large scale typically extended only until log10
ᐍ ≈ 6 (ᐍ ≈ 1 Mb).

Isochores - long (>>300 kb), compositionally fairly
homogeneous genome regions of different average GC
levels were uncovered by analytical ultracentrifugation of
bulk DNA [4-10]. The phylogenetic distribution of isochores was traditionally studied by centrifugation techniques [7-11], but the analysis of base composition at
third codon position or the comparison of GC content
between coding and non-coding sequences [12-17] has
been also used.

The scaling exponent α is given by the slope of the linear fit.
The artificial sequence was generated using a standard
method to create long-range correlated sequences [31] by
imposing that α = 0.90, and the DFA recovers correctly this
scaling exponent. The DNA sequence analyzed is the largest
contig from human chr. IV mapped into a binary sequence
using the SW (strong-weak) mapping rule: C or G → 1, A or
T → 0. Its scaling exponent is αfit = 0.76.

Biological source for the two characteristic scales in
human DNA
Short- and long-range genome structure is shaped by a
wide range of structural, functional, and evolutionary factors acting on the DNA sequence: mutational bias, transcriptional activity, translational constraints, patterns of
gene expression, open or closed state of the chromatin,
insertion of repeat elements, etc. (see [7-10] for review).
Because of its overlap, discerning the role of each of these
factors is a difficult task. Experiments of selective shuffling
of some genome regions, while leaving others intact, can
be used to approach this problem. Here, we used such
selective shuffling to identify the biological source for the
two characteristic scales identified in DNA sequences [19].
As an example, Figure 3 shows the results for human chromosome 21. When the sequence segments corresponding
to the isochore-like regions (as determined by the algorithm IsoFinder [24]) were internally shuffled, the small
scale properties disappeared, and the α(ᐍ) profile
remained flat with a constant value of 0.5, as expected in
a random sequence without compositional structure. The
only effect of the shuffling in the large scale was a slight
increase in the corresponding peak: as the shuffling
homogenizes the small scale, the large scale patchiness
becomes more discernible. Therefore, the large scale properties observed in the α(ᐍ) profile can be unambiguously

Figure 2
Detecting deviations from power-law behavior
Detecting deviations from power-law behavior. The
deviations from power-law behavior can be detected by plotting the local α value vs. the scale ᐍ (see Methods). The
sequence with real scaling presents a constant value of α(ᐍ)
with small fluctuations around the linear fitting value -αfit =
0.90 (dotted line). However, in human DNA, α(ᐍ) is far from
being a constant: the fluctuations around the value resulting
from the linear fitting (αfit = 0.76, dotted line) are not only
very large but also following a particular pattern, indicating
that this αfit value is meaningless, and that there is no real
scaling despite the good linear fitting.

attributed to the computationally predicted, isochore-like
regions [19]. However, when the isochore-like sequences
were shuffled internally but transposable elements (TEs)
were left untouched, or when only the TEs were shuffled
internally, the α(ᐍ) profile is almost identical to the original α(ᐍ) profile of the natural sequence. This means that
the TEs are the main contributors to the heterogeneity at
intermediate scale, although introns and exons also make
a contribution (see [19] for details).
Phylogenetic distribution
As shown above, the α(ᐍ) profile revealed as a simple and
powerful method to determine the phylogenetic distribution of large-scale patchiness. Two α(ᐍ) profiles have been
already shown for the human genome in Figures 2 and 3.
We have also plotted sample α(ᐍ) profiles for good-quality chromosome sequences from chimpanzee and dog
(Fig. 4), mouse and rat (Fig. 5), chicken and Danio (Fig.
6), Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 7) and Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 8). The
numerical values to trace the α(ᐍ) profiles for the remaining chromosomes with sequence contigs of good-quality
and sufficient length from all these species are given in the

artificial sequence obtained after the in silico determined, isochore-like regions were internally shuffled, the artificial
sequence obtained by shuffling the isochore-like regions
without touching the TEs, and the artificial sequence
obtained by shuffling the TEs are shown.

The extension of the intermediate scale in the other vertebrate genomes is similar to that observed in the human
genome, and also in the Arabidopsis genome, while in the
invertebrates (Drosophila and Caenorhabditis) the intermediate scale reaches only to 3 kbp. Notably, in the yeast
genome this intermediate scale does not exist at all. The
beginning of the large scale in all the genomes analyzed
ranged from 10 to 30 kbp, while the ending length often
extended beyond 100 kbp, or even 1 Mb, depending
mainly on the length of the available sequence contigs.
The phylogenetic distribution of compositional patchiness within vertebrates has been traditionally assessed by
ultracentrifugation of bulk DNA [11,13,16], uncovering a
clear isochore structure in mammals and birds [6,10] and
also in some reptiles [16]. The α(ᐍ) profiles used here
reveal large-scale genome patchiness on a wider phylogenetic range, extending to invertebrates (Drosophila and C.
elegans), plants (A. thaliana) and yeasts (S. cerevisiae).
Besides the profiles for the natural sequence, all these figures also include the profiles for the corresponding artificial sequence obtained by internally shuffling the
isochore-like sequence regions, as predicted by IsoFinder
[24]. In all the genomes analyzed, the large scale was practically unaffected (save the peak increase due to the
homogenization at the small scales). Therefore, the large-

Discussion
Large-scale genome compositional heterogeneity has
been traditionally revealed through analytical ultracentrifugation of bulk DNA in a large range of genomes (for
recent reviews see [8,10]). However, at the sequence level,
such demonstration has been hampered by the lack of a
consistent, reliable, and widely applicable method. The
α(ᐍ) profiles used here prove to be an excellent tool for

this task, allowing us to determine the extent of the different scales of genome compositional heterogeneity in a
wide phylogenetic range: yeasts, plants, invertebrates,
fishes, birds and mammals. Additionally, the selective
shuffling experiments used here to specifically randomize
selected genome segments, while not touching others,
allow us to identify the in silico determined, isochore-like
regions as the biological source for large-scale patchiness
throughout the entire range of the species analyzed.
A clear limitation of our approach is that it depends critically on the availability of good-quality sequence contigs
of sufficient length. For this reason, we have analyzed only
the best genome assemblies from eleven eukaryotic spe-

spectrum (mammals, birds, fishes, invertebrates, plants
and yeasts) the conclusions should be general.
In all these genomes, the large-scale patchiness revealed
by α(ᐍ) profiles can be associated with the isochore-like
genome regions predicted by IsoFinder, thus emphasizing
the reliability of this algorithm in predicting isochore-like
regions at the sequence level.

Conclusion
The analysis of the deviations in the power-law behavior
of long-range correlations, through α(ᐍ) profiles, allowed

through selective shuffling experiments, we were able to
identify the computationally-determined, isochore-like
structure of these genomes as the biological source for
such large-scale patchiness.

rule: C or G → si = 1, A or T → si = 0. Note that this mapping rule is particularly appropriate to analyze genomewide correlations, since it corresponds to the most fundamental partitioning of the four bases into their natural
pairs in the double helix (A-T and G-C). As expected [29],
when the purine-pyrymidine mapping rule was assayed,
only structures at intermediate, but not at large, scale were
detected (not shown).

Arabidopsis thaliana (Arab) was downloaded from the
NCBI FTP site [26]).
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and deviations from
perfect power-law behavior
The DFA method [2,27,28] is aimed to detect and quantify long-range correlations in numerical sequences, and
therefore DNA sequences have to be mapped into numerical ones prior to the application of DFA. Thus, a DNA
chain of length N is of the form s1 s2 ... sN, and the si values
are obtained according to the strong-weak (SW) mapping

Finally, we obtain the fluctuation function F(ᐍ) in this
way:

F( ) =

1
NW

NW

⎛

∑ ⎜⎜⎝ 1 ∑ Y
j =1

k =1

⎞

2
⎟
j ( k)

⎟
⎠

(4)

where Yj(k) is the k-th point (k = 1 ... ᐍ) within the j-th
window (j = 1 ... NW). Therefore, F(ᐍ) accounts for the
average fluctuation of the series around its local trend at
scale ᐍ.
Fractal long-range correlations appear when F(ᐍ) scales in
the form:
F(ᐍ) ∝ ᐍα

(5)

The exponent α quantifies the type and the strength of the
correlations and can be determined by fitting F(ᐍ) vs. ᐍ to
a straight line in a log-log plot, the slope being α (Fig. 1).
If α = 0.5, there is no correlation and the sequence
behaves as a random series (white noise), α < 0.5 indicates
anti-correlations, and α > 0.5 positive correlations. However, this procedure can mask information present in the

signal (see [19] for details) and we prefer to determine α
as

Additional file 1

α(ᐍ) = d log (F(ᐍ))/d log (ᐍ)
In this way, deviations from power-law behavior lead to
local variations of α which can be detected by plotting
α(ᐍ) vs. ᐍ (Fig. 2). The DNA sequence shown in this figure,
corresponding to the long contig of 92.1 Mb from human
chromosome IV, clearly shows two main deviations from
the power-law behavior, suggesting the presence of two
main characteristic scales (the two major peaks in α(ᐍ)) at
intermediate and large ᐍ values [19].
Selective shuffling experiments
A shuffled sequence is a random permutation of the original DNA sequence and can be used to test hypotheses
concerning any pattern uncovered in DNA sequences.
Shuffling can affect the entire sequence or be restricted to
only certain regions within a sequence in order to test the
influence of such regions on the overall behavior of the
one being observed. Here, we carried out selective-shuffling experiments by shuffling only those regions in the
genome sequence corresponding to the isochore-like
regions predicted by IsoFinder [24]. All the patterns
within the isochore-like regions are destroyed by such
shuffling, while those out of these regions remain intact.
Selectivity in the shuffling process can go a step further
when certain genome elements within the isochore-like
regions (e.g. TEs) are preserved from shuffling, thereby
also remaining intact while the rest of the region is randomized. We obtained both types of partially shuffled
sequences in order to identify the biological source for the
two length scales observed in the α(ᐍ) profiles. The coordinates for isochore-like regions identified by IsoFinder
on each chromosome sequence of the eleven genomes
analyzed in this study are available at the Online Resource
on Isochore Mapping [30].
