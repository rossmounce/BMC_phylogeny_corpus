Abstract
Background: Transcription factors activate their target genes by binding to specific response
elements. Many transcription factor families evolved from a common ancestor by gene duplication
and subsequent divergent evolution. Members of the p53 family, which play key roles in cell-cycle
control and development, share conserved DNA binding and oligomerisation domains but exhibit
distinct functions. In this study, the molecular basis of the functional divergence of related
transcription factors was investigated.
Results: We characterised the DNA-binding specificity and oligomerisation properties of human
p53, p63 and p73, as well as p53 from other organisms using novel biophysical approaches. All p53
family members bound DNA cooperatively as tetramers with high affinity. Despite structural
differences in the oligomerisation domain, the dissociation constants of the tetramers was in the
low nanomolar range for all family members, indicating that the strength of tetramerisation was
evolutionarily conserved. However, small differences in the oligomerisation properties were
observed, which may play a regulatory role. Intriguingly, the DNA-binding specificity of p53 family
members was highly conserved even for evolutionarily distant species. Additionally, DNA
recognition was only weakly affected by CpG methylation. Prediction of p53/p63/p73 binding sites
in the genome showed almost complete overlap between the different homologs.
Conclusion: Diversity of biological function of p53 family members is not reflected in differences
in sequence-specific DNA binding. Hence, additional specificity factors must exist, which allowed
the acquisition of novel functions during evolution while preserving original roles.

Background
Sequence-specific transcription factors are responsible for
processing environmental and developmental signals,
and initiating the appropriate cellular response. The total
number of transcription factors of an organism increases
with its complexity: it is estimated to be around 300 for

yeast, 1000 for worms and 3000 for humans [1]. Besides
a DNA-binding domain, another common feature of
many transcription factors, such as basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) factors and basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP)
factors, is an additional oligomerisation domain (OD)
[2,3]. A functional role for oligomerisation is easy to

rationalize: it combines the DNA-binding specificity of
individual monomeric domains, leading to a substantial
increase in binding affinity. Divergence of transcription
factor function within a family could originate from evolutionary changes in the DNA-binding specificity and in
the oligomerisation properties.
A highly important family of transcription factors that
play a key role in cell-cycle control and development is
that of p53, p63 and p73. p53 is at the centre of a tumour
suppressor network [4,5], and, as such, is essential for the
prevention of cancer [6,7]. Both p63 and p73 are involved
in developmental processes. p63 is essential for epidermal
morphogenesis and limb development, whereas p73 is
involved in the development of neural structures and the
pheromone detection system, among its other roles. Nevertheless, p63 and p73 are also involved in processes controlled by p53 [8]. Interestingly, different functions are
also observed even for closely related p53 orthologs. For
example, genes encoding proteins involved in DNA
metabolism are responsive to p53 in humans but not in
mice [9]. All three family members consist of a structured
DNA-binding domain (DBD), an oligomerisation
domain and intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation and C-terminal regulatory domains [10]. Additionally, p63 and p73 also contain a structured sterile alpha
motif (SAM) and an inhibitory domain at the C-terminus
[11]. The majority of cancer-associated p53 mutations are
found in the DNA-binding domain [6,7], highlighting the
importance of correct DNA recognition. p53 specifically
binds to a 20 base pair (bp) consensus DNA sequence,
also called a response element (RE), consisting of two
repeats of 5'-RRRCWWGYYY-3' (where R = A or G; Y = C
or T; W = A or T), separated by 0-13 bp [12,13]. In addition, p53 also recognises a large number of sequences that
deviate from this consensus site definition [14,15]. Several studies have shown that p53, p63 and p73 can recognise the same sites [16-18]. Additionally, each protein has
different isoforms [19], which, in most cases, have identical DNA-binding domains but exhibit differences in transcriptional activity, adding an additional layer of
complexity [17].
Despite a high degree of sequence conservation, particularly in the DNA-binding and tetramerisation domains,
p53, p63 and p73 fulfil at least partially different roles.
The molecular basis of how closely related transcription
factors differentiate between their respective target genes
is only poorly understood. Here, we characterised the oligomerisation and DNA-binding properties of several p53
family members. Firstly, we determined the dissociation
constants for dimers and tetramers of p53 family members using analytical ultracentrifugation. We then compared the DNA-binding specificity of full-length human
p53 (Hsp53) with that of its paralogs p63 and p73,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/628

including the isoforms ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, ΔNp63γ,
ΔNp73β and an engineered truncated version of p73 containing DNA-binding and parts of the oligomerisation
domain only (p73CT, residues 104-383). We also compared the DNA-binding specificity of human p53 with
that of its orthologs from a number of species at varying
evolutionary distances from humans: mouse (Mus musculus, Mmp53), frog (Xenopus laevis, Xlp53), zebrafish
(Danio rerio, Drp53) and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster,
Dmp53). In these measurements, we included effects of
CpG methylation as an additional factor potentially influencing DNA-binding specificity. We used a method for
quantification of DNA-binding specificity which we have
recently developed [15,20]. Using fluorescence anisotropy
titrations, we measured the effect of every possible single
base pair substitution of a consensus sequence on the
affinity of the proteins for DNA. The DNA-binding data
were then used to identify putative binding sites within
the human genome to assess the impact of the differences
in DNA-binding specificity.

Results
Oligomerisation equilibria
We have shown previously that full-length human p53
dissociates into dimers at nanomolar concentration, and
that oligomerisation is essential for high-affinity DNA
binding [21,22]. Here, we studied the oligomerisation
properties of members of the p53 family, namely Dmp53,
Drp53, Hsp53, Mmp53, and Xlp53, as well as human
ΔNp63β and ΔNp73β. The p63 and p73 isoforms contain
intact DNA-binding and tetramerisation domains. We
used sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation
(SV-AUC) experiments with a fluorescence detection system [23], which allows measurements to be made at low
nanomolar concentrations. To specifically incorporate a
fluorophore, we expressed proteins with a C-terminal
CCPGCC tetra-cysteine tag and labelled them with FlAsHEDT2, an arsenic derivative of fluorescein [24].

The sedimentation profile of Hsp53 at 22.5 μM monomer
concentration, measured using absorbance detection
(data not shown), showed only one peak at ~2.9 S, which
we assigned to a tetramer, because the protein has been
shown to be tetrameric at this concentration [22]. Subsequently, we measured the sedimentation profiles of
labelled proteins at different concentrations using the fluorescence detection system (Figure 1 and Additional file
1). At lower concentrations, a second peak appeared at 1.8
to 2.0 S. In order to improve the resolution of the sedimentation profiles in the range between 0.5 and 3 S, we
repeated our experiments at higher rotor speeds (60 k
rpm). In addition to the tetramer peak, we were able to
resolve two peaks at 1.1 S and 1.9 S, which correspond to
monomers and dimers, respectively.

All proteins studied formed tetramers which dissociate
into dimers. For some proteins, these dimers dissociated
into monomers. It was possible to determine their sedimentation profiles with well-resolved peaks, and thus to
calculate the dissociation constants Kd for the monomerdimer and dimer-tetramer equilibria (Additional file 2,
Figure 2). The dissociation constants for the dimertetramer equilibria of Dmp53, Drp53 and ΔNp73β were

in the low nanomolar range. The self-association was
about 5 times weaker for ΔNp63β and about 10 times
weaker for Mmp53, Hsp53 and Xlp53. At low nanomolar
concentrations, tetramers of human p53 dissociated into
dimers, whereas those of human p63 and p73 readily dissociated into dimers and monomers. In the case of p63,
the dissociation constants for momomer-dimer and
dimer-tetramer equlibria were similar. For p73, the dimermonomer Kd was even larger than the dimer-tetramer Kd.
This indicates that only small amounts of p73 dimers are
present in solution. For human p53, this is not the case, as
the monomer-dimer Kd is about 20 times lower than the
dimer-tetramer Kd. No monomers were observed for
Dmp53 and Drp53.
DNA-binding specificity of p53 family members is highly
conserved
It is often assumed that diverging transcription factors
have differences in their DNA-binding specificity, which
result in preferential recognition of a different response
element sequence and an associated change in function.
To answer the question of whether the p53 response element sequence is evolving and diverging, we compared
the DNA-binding specificity of human p53, p63 and p73,
and p53 from different species. We used a fluorescence
anisotropy assay, which we had developed earlier for
quantifying the DNA-binding specificity of Hsp53
[15,21].

First, the Kd between fluorescently labelled DNA and protein was measured using direct titrations (Figure 3A). Data
were analysed using the Hill equation. The measured Kd
values were similar for all proteins studied (Table 1), and

Kd for the binding event between the labelled DNA and the protein. B) Displacement of a labelled reporter oligonucleotide
from the complex by an unlabelled competitor oligonucleotide, reflected by a decrease in the anisotropy, allows accurate
measurement of the difference in the Kd between two sequences. Shown are typical titration curves for a competition experiment, in this case Xlp53: a 50 μM solution of competitor DNA was titrated into a solution of 20 nM labelled DNA and 400 nM
Xlp53. Measured anisotropies are shown for a tight (Ref, logKd = -7.08, squares, straight line), an average (A5G, logKd = -6.64,
circles, dashed line) and a weak (G7C, logKd = -5.70, triangles, dotted line) binding sequence with corresponding fits.
observed differences were within the error range of the
method. The only exception was p73CT, which bound
about 4-5 times more weakly than the ΔNp73β isoform.
Weaker binding of p73CT can be attributed to impaired
self-oligomerisation due to a truncation of the tetramerisation domain, which has been shown to destabilise the
tetramer [25]. The Hill coefficient n was averaged over all
measured datasets (n = 1.64), which was in close agreement with the value we have previously reported for
human p53 [22]. In combination with analytical ultracentrifugation data, we can conclude that for all the proteins
studied two dimers bind DNA cooperatively and form a
tetramer, similarly to human p53 [21].
The driving force for recognition of a specific DNA
sequence surrounded by non-specific seqences is not the
absolute affinity but rather specificity, or the relative affinity for specific vs. non-specific sequences. To define the
DNA-binding specificity of the members of the p53 family, we measured the affinity of the proteins to all possible
permutations of a reference consensus binding sequence
(Additional file 3) using a fluorescence competition titration assay (Figure 3B). This sequence contains two identical copies of a GGACATGTCC half-site and is one of the
tightest-binding sequences for human p53 [15]. The
results for all the p53 homologs analysed are summarised
in Figure 4. For every nucleotide substitution, the difference of the logarithm of the dissociation constants for the
mutated sequence and the reference sequence (ΔlogKd)
was determined. High positive values of ΔlogKd indicate
high affinity penalties and low probability of observing

this substitution in the binding site. The effects of nucleotide substitution are also presented as a sequence logo
(Figure 5), which depicts the most preferred nucleotide at
a position as the largest letter, and the relative selectivity
at this position as the height of the bar. Based on the affinity differences, we calculated expected relative nucleotide
frequencies for each position, and a corresponding bit
score ranging from 0 to 2 [26,27]. Key features of the
response element are highly conserved between all the
proteins studied. The largest decrease in affinity was
caused by nucleotide changes at positions 4 and 7, which
correspond to the invariant C and G in the RRRCWWGYYY consensus sequence. Nucleotide changes at positions 5 and 6, corresponding to the central WW element,
and positions 3 and 8, also caused significant changes in
the affinity. Generally, changes at the outer positions 1, 2
and 9, 10 did not significantly affect binding. Accordingly,
the largest contributions to the overall DNA-binding specificity are made by positions 4 and 7, followed by 3, 5, 6,
and 8. The observed changes can be alternatively
expressed as a consensus sequence definition (Table 1).
Selecting the nucleotide changes resulting in the highest
affinity at each position defines the highest affinity
sequence. A better reflection of DNA-binding specificity is
to apply a cut-off value representing the error of the measurement. All nucleotides at a particular position that cause
a lower affinity change, ΔlogKd, than the cut-off value are
treated as having equal binding properties. Depending on
the cut-off value, a number of different nucleotides can be
present at a given position. For example, Dmp53 recognises the highest affinity sequence GAACATGTCC, which

becomes NRACATGTMB at a cut-off value of 0.1 logKd
units, and NDACRTGTHN at 0.2 logKd units, where N =
any nucleotide; R = G or A; M = A or C; B = G, C or T; H =
A, C or T; and W = A or T. As was shown for human p53
[14,15], the observed DNA-binding specificity for all the
proteins studied is less stringent than the originally proposed definition of the p53 consensus sequence RRRCWWGYYY [12].
Despite the overall similarities of the DNA-specificity profiles, there are also some notable differences. The magnitude of the penalties with respect to the ΔlogKd associated
with nucleotide changes and the corresponding contribution to the overall specificity of binding varies for different
proteins. Both mammalian (human and mouse) p53 proteins, which had the lowest bit score (Table 1), showed
the lowest specificity. Evolutionarily more distant verte-

brate proteins (zebrafish Drp53 and frog Xlp53) exhibited
a selectivity pattern very similar to the mammalian proteins but showed higher bit score values of 10.8 and 12.8.
Approximately 40 to 50% of the overall specificity came
from positions 4 and 7. These positions were even more
important for human p63 and p73 and invertebrate p53
(Dmp53), because they contributed 50 to 70% to the
overall specificity. It is interesting to note that while most
proteins prefered the C(A/T)(T/A)G motif at the centre of
the half-site, p63, p73 and Dmp53 had a slight preference
for G compared to T at position 5, recognising the motif
C(A/G)(T/A)G or C(A/G/T)(T/A)G, depending on the
selected cut-off. This observation resonates with findings
of Osada et al. that p63 preferentially recognises RRRCGTGYYY [17], although A at position 5 resulted in stronger
binding in our experiments. The other interesting feature
is that p73 favoured G over A in position 3. This is in con-

Sequence logos for all p53 family proteins studied
Sequence logos for all p53 family proteins studied. The complete response element is shown, and bit values are plotted
against sequence position. A value of 0 means all four nucleotides bind with the same affinity and there is no selectivity,
whereas the value 2 stands for absolute selectivity for one nucleotide, with the other three being highly penalised. A measure
of the total information content (or selectivity) of the protein can be calculated by summing up all individual bit scores at every
position. The maximum theoretical value of information content for a 20-bp response element is 40 bit.

trast to findings which suggest an A preceding the CWWG
followed by a T forms the most stable complexes with p73
[18]. It is worth noting that the overall effects of nucleotide substitutions at positions 3 and 5 were relatively
small compared to the effects at the positions 4 and 7.
While the isoforms ΔNp63β and ΔNp63γ behaved almost
identically, the isoform ΔNp63α showed considerably
smaller affinity penalties, meaning it is less specific. Interestingly, the DNA-binding affinities in the direct titrations
and affinities for the reference sequence in competition
experiments were similar for all isoforms. This suggests
that the presence of the extreme C-terminal post-SAM
domain in ΔNp63α may affect its DNA-binding specificity. Despite the significantly weaker binding of p73CT
compared to ΔNp73β to DNA, the DNA-binding specificity of both p73 proteins was identical. This suggests that
the DNA-binding specificity of tetrameric p73 is determined by the DNA-binding properties of individual DNAbinding domains, whereas the absolute affinity depends
on the oligomerisation equilibrium.
DNA methylation does not alter the specificity of p53
family members
CpG methylation has been shown to affect DNA recognition of transcription factors [28-30]. To investigate the
effects of CpG methylation on DNA recognition of p53
family proteins, we used a method that we have previously applied to human p53 [20]. We systematically introduced a CpG dinucleotide at each position in the
consensus p53 DNA binding sequence and identified substitutions tolerated by p53 family proteins. We then compared the binding affinities of methylated versus nonmethylated sequences containing CpG (Additional file 4).
Vertebrate p53 proteins (Mmp53, Xlp53 and Drp53)
behaved similarly to human p53 and were mildly affected
by substitutions at positions 2, 4 and 6. Interestingly,
methylated sequences bound somewhat more tightly than
non-methylated, although the effect of a single methylation was small. p63 and p73, along with invertebrate
Dmp53, also tolerated CpG nucleotides at these positions. In particular, substitution at position 4 hardly
changed the affinity, confirming that the CGTC central
element of the binding site is recognised equally well as
CATG, which is preferred by p53.
Computational genome analysis
Transcription factors recognise a range of sequences which
deviate from the highest affinity sequence. As a result of
this deviation, the affinity of these sequences can be significantly weaker than that of the highest affinity
sequence. We have previously shown that most of the
reported p53 binding sites have affinity values up to 1.5
logKd units weaker than the highest affinity sequence, and
that there is a very large number of potential binding sites

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/628

in the genome [15]. In this study, the highest affinity
sequence was practically identical for all the proteins studied, but the relative penalties for nucleotide substitutions
were different. Such differential penalties may result in
selection of non-overlapping sets of binding sites by different p53 family members.
To compare the selected sets of the putative binding sites,
we computationally predicted all binding sites in the
human genome using our affinity data (Additional file 5).
We calculated affinity values for every position in the
genome (see methods), and selected high-affinity ones
using laboratory-developed software. Firstly, we compared the sets of binding sites predicted for human p53,
p63 and p73 proteins (Figure 6 and Additional file 6). As
we have shown previously for human p53 [15], the
number of binding sites increases exponentially with an
increasing cut-off value. Since the relative specificity of
binding, as reflected by the bit-score value, is higher for
p63 and p73 than for p53, there were fewer predicted sites
selected at a cut-off value of 1.5 logKd units. We then
determined the overlap between the predicted sets of
binding sites, taking into account an error of prediction,
ep, of 0.35 logKd units, which we had determined previously for Hsp53 [15]. For almost all proteins, the overlap
was >98% at cut-off values between 0.5 and 1.5 ΔlogKd.
The only exception was Dmp53, which did not show overlap values higher than 68% with Hsp53. Remarkably,

Dmp53 showed overlaps close to 100% with ΔNp63α.
Overall, the results of computational analysis suggest that,
based on DNA-binding preferences alone, all members of
p53 family bind the same set of putative sites in the
human genome. The observed quantitative differences in
the binding preferences may result in different affinities
toward specific binding site sequences, but not in diverging sets of target sites within a given genome.

Discussion
Oligomerisation properties of p53 family proteins
The tetramerisation domain of Hsp53 (residues 325-356)
is highly conserved in all vertebrate proteins of the p53
family [31]. A sequence alignment of the tetramerisation
domain region of proteins used in this study is shown in
Additional file 7. The Hsp53 tetramerisation domain
forms a dimer of dimers and is composed of short monomeric building blocks consisting of a β-strand followed by
an α-helix [32-34]. The primary dimers are stabilized by
an intermolecular β-sheet and mainly hydrophobic helix
packing interactions. In addition, the primary-dimer
interface is stabilised by a salt bridge, which is typical for
p53 orthologs but not found in its paralogs (Figure 7,
Additional file 7). The tetrameric interface is formed by
hydrophobic helix packing interactions. The hydrophobic
interfaces are largely conserved in all the proteins studied
except for Dmp53, which shows no significant sequence
conservation and has a dimer-dimer interface that features
a cluster of charged residues at its centre [31]. Importantly,
recent structural studies have shown that the p73 tetramerisation domain contains an additional C-terminal helix,
which is essential for the structural integrity and stability
of the tetramer (Figure 7A). This helix is conserved in p63
and presumably has a similar structural role [25,35].

We determined dissociation constants for the monomerdimer and dimer-tetramer equilibria of seven members of
the p53 family (Figure 2, Additional file 2). Hsp53,
Mmp53 and Xlp53 showed very similar Kd values, consistent with the high conservation of contact residues. p63
and p73 form tighter tetramers than human p53, which,
at least in the case of p73, can be attributed to extensive
inter-dimer contacts made by the additional C-terminal
helix (Figure 7A). Drp53, which, phylogenetically, can be
placed somewhere between mammalian p53 and the
p63/p73 paralogs [25], also forms more stable tetramers.
What is most surprising is that Dmp53 forms tetramers
with a comparable Kd, while having a completely different
dimer-dimer interface, suggesting that, despite structural
divergence, the strength of the tetramer has been conserved through evolution.
Interestingly, the primary-dimer interface is tighter in p53
than in p73 (6-fold) and p63 (9-fold). Comparison of the
Hsp53 and Drp53 sequences with p63 and p73 suggests

that this difference in dimer stability may be attributed to
the R337-D352 salt bridge that stabilizes the helix packing
in the p53 primary dimer and large-to-small substitutions
of hydrophobic residues in p63 and p73. The salt bridge
is highly conserved in p53 across different species, and its
disruption by a germline mutation (R337H) has been
linked with adrenocortical carcinomas in children and
other cancer forms [36,37]. p63 and p73 lack this intermolecular salt bridge and have a threonine (p63) and
glutamine (p73) instead of the arginine in p53. As a result
of the weakened dimer interface in p63 and p73, the dimers formed by tetramer dissociation are more likely to dis-

sociate directly into monomers. Since key features of the
primary dimer interface are highly conserved among different species for each paralog, it is likely that they exhibit
dissociation equilibria similar to their human orthologs.
The only exceptions are Cavia porcellus and Pteropus
vampyrus, whose p53 lacks the paralog-specific salt bridge
and may, therefore, also have weakened primary dimers.
The observed differences in dissociation equilibria of the
human paralogs may have important biological implications for interactions with regulatory proteins, such as
members of the S100 family, which have been shown to
differentially bind different oligomeric states of p53
[38,39]. Taken together, our results show that the overall
strength of oligomerisation was conserved during the evolution of members of the p53 family, while subtle differences in the equilibria may play a role in fine-tuning their
biological activity.
DNA-contact residues are highly conserved in vertebrates
The sequence identity of the DNA-binding domain of p53
family members varies and is highest between p53 from
closely related species, e.g. 86% identity between mouse
and human proteins and ~60% between Drp53/Xlp53
and Hsp53. Hsp53 makes direct sequence-specific contacts with bases in the major groove of DNA via the side
chains of K120, A276, C277 and R280. Contacts with the
phosphate backbone are made by the side chains of S241,
R248 and R273, and the backbone amides of K120 and
A276 [40,41]. All DNA-contact residues are conserved in
the vertebrate proteins studied (Additional file 8). Upon
binding to a DNA half-site, two DBDs form a self-complementary protein-protein interface, mediated by residues
P177, H178, R181, M243 and G244, which are conserved
in vertebrate p53 [40,41]. In human p63 and p73 (~60%
sequence identity with Hsp53), however, there are key
substitutions in this region, indicating differences in the
inter-DBD interactions. Dmp53 shows only 24%
sequence identity to human p53 [42], with significant differences in the various DNA-binding motifs. K120 in the
flexible L1 loop of Hsp5 binds to two purine bases in position 2 and 3 of the response element. The equivalent loop
in Dmp53 is shortened and more rigid, making it unlikely
that the lysine (K102 in Dmp53) forms the same DNA
contacts as in Hsp53. In addition, the alanine (A276)
making sequence-specific hydrophobic contacts in Hsp53
[40] is replaced by a threonine in Dmp53 (T262). Furthermore, the DNA-backbone contact residue R273 in Hsp53
is replaced by a lysine (K259). The L3 loop, which docks
to the DNA minor groove via R248 in Hsp53, is also significantly different. It has a deletion and lacks the equivalent of R249, which plays a key role in stabilizing this
region in Hsp53 [43]. Moreover, the L2/L3-loop region
that forms the self-complementary DBD-DBD interface
also shows variations, similarly to p63 and p73. Taken

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/628

together, it would be reasonable to expect that the DNAbinding properties of Dmp53 differ from those of Hsp53.
Conservation of the p53 response element and DNAbinding specificity
We quantified the DNA-binding properties of several
members of the p53 family and investigated their ability
to recognise methylated DNA. We found that the DNAbinding specificity of both orthologs and paralogs of p53
was conserved. Human and mouse p53 proteins showed
almost identical specificity, consistent with their highest
sequence conservation. It is also interesting to note that
they exhibited the lowest absolute specificity, as reflected
by the lowest bit score of the derived motif. Evolutionarily
more distant vertebrate p53 proteins (Xlp53 and Drp53)
showed a very similar specificity profile but somewhat
higher specificity. There seems to be a very interesting
underlying correlation: the more complex the organism
and the more complex the p53 pathway, the lower the
absolute specificity. p63 and p73 showed slightly different
DNA-binding specificity compared with p53. This difference may be the result of the different residues in p63 and
p73 being responsible for the interaction between two
DBDs upon binding to a half-site motif. Despite the low
sequence similarity of Dmp53 and human p53, and their
aforementioned differences in key DNA-binding motifs,
the DNA-binding specificity of Dmp53 is preserved and is
similar to that of vertebrate p53 family members, in particular the more ancestral p63 and p73 proteins. The longest p63 isoform tested, ΔNp63α, has a significantly
reduced DNA-binding specificity compared to other isoforms. It is possible that the additional post-SAM domain
present in this isoform is directly or indirectly involved in
regulation of its sequence-specific binding.

Using the affinity prediction, we identified all putative
binding sites in the human genome for p53, p63 and p73
proteins. Despite quantitative differences in their DNAbinding specificity, all transcription factors studied select
overlapping sets of binding sites. We found many more
putative binding sites than have been previously identified in genome-wide experiments for p53/p63/p73 proteins [44-46]. The vast majority (95%) of experimentally
identified p53 binding sites [44] contains a site predicted
using our affinity data. The published dataset for p63 [45]
consists of 5000 sites, which is significantly more than the
1700 sites reported for p53. Less than 20% of these 5000
sites contain a predicted high-affinity p63 site within a
500 bp window, perhaps reflecting different stringency
criteria in peak calling in these two studies. Despite these
differences, analysis of all in vivo binding-site sequences in
these studies generated positional weight matrices, represented as sequence logos, which are very similar to the
sequence logos derived by us based on in vitro binding
affinity. This strongly suggests that the driving force for

localisation of p53/p63/p73 to their respective sites in the
genome is their sequence-specific binding. A recent study
using a novel microsphere assay showed that the DNAbinding specificity of endogenous p53 in cell lysate is the
same as that of the purified recombinant p53 from our
work [47]. Nevertheless, several validated p53 response
elements contain non-canonical sequences [48,49]. It was
shown, that p53 acts weakly to moderately on response
elements that contain only a half or a three quarter site of
the canonical consensus sequence [50]. This is in accordance with our results, as we observed considerable binding to DNA with a mutated quarter or half site, which de
facto represents a non-canonical p53 response element.
Binding to non-canonical response elements may be facilitated by co-activating transcription factors. A comprehensive comparison between in vivo and in vitro binding can
be found in an excellent recent review [51].
How can transcription factors with virtually identical
DNA-binding specificity elicit different biological
responses? There is also the closely related question of
how transcription factors select their binding site in the
genome, among many potential sites of comparable affinity? The "chromatin structure" and "DNA accessibility"
concepts may at least partially answer the second question, although the mechanism controlling the chromatin
structure with the specificity required is presently
unknown. Different expression patterns of transcription
factors and/or their abundance in the nucleus can also
contribute to their specificity. The involvement of additional specificity factors would answer both questions.
Such additional specificity factors should also bind DNA
in a sequence-specific manner, and are likely to be transcription factors.

Conclusions
Taken together, our data show that tetramerisation of p53
family members, which is important for high-affinity
DNA binding, was established very early in the evolution
of the p53 family and has been functionally conserved
ever since. Despite significant differences in the contact
surfaces involved, the strength of oligomerisation was preserved. Intriguingly, the DNA-binding specificity of different p53 family members is highly conserved even for
evolutionarily distant species. This suggests that original
functions were preserved while new functions were
acquired during evolution, utilising the same DNA-binding specificity. The "core function" DNA-binding specificity of the p53 transcription factor network did not
substantially change during evolution. Instead, there is
accumulating evidence that functional divergence of the
p53 family evolved through changes in the connectivity
within the network, for example by interactions of p53
family members with different sets of co-activating transcription factors.

Methods
Protein cloning
For human full-length p53 we used wild type protein for
DNA-binding experiments and a super-stable mutant,
which has four mutations in the core domain (QMHsp53, M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D) [52,53], for analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. A plasmid encoding Mmp53 was kindly provided by Geoffrey Wahl.
Dmp53 was amplified from a cDNA library kindly provided by Simon Bullock. Coding sequences encoding for
other studied proteins were amplified from clones
obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC),
distributed via Geneservice (UK). For the ΔNp63γ isoform, parts of the gene were amplified from a genomic
DNA library (Geneservice). Additionally, we made a p73
construct containing the DBD and parts of the OD
(p73CT, residues 104-383). All inserts were subcloned
into a pET24a-HLTEV plasmid containing an N-terminal
6xHis purification tag, a lipoyl domain [54] for improved
solubility and a TEV-protease cleavage site. Constructs
containing a C-terminal FlAsH-tag CCPGCC [24] were
designed in a similar manner.
Small scale expression screening
Small-scale screening for soluble expression in different
cell lines was performed in 2 ml cultures on microplates
in 2xTY media following induction with 1 mM IPTG. Proteins were purified using His-Fusion magnetic beads (BioClone Inc) on a BioSprint15 robot (Qiagen). Purified
fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE pre- and post-digestion with TEV-protease.
Expression and purification
Large-scale expression and purification was carried out
largely as described earlier [20,22]. All proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 or B834 cells (Novagen) at 18°C
for 16-20 h and purified using standard Ni-affinity chromatography protocols. Subsequently, the N-terminal tags
were cleaved off by TEV-protease digestion. As a second
purification step for p53 orthologs, heparin affinity chromatography was used. Solutions were diluted to reduce
the salt concentration to about 30 mM NaCl. Proteins
were eluted using a 20 column volume NaCl gradient (0
to 1 M NaCl). The final purification step was gel filtration
chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/60 preparative
gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 225 mM NaCl,
25 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 10% glycerol and 5
mM DTT. Protein purity of >95% was determined by SDSgel electrophoresis. Samples were flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until used.
Labelling proteins with FlAsH
Labelling of C-terminally FlAsH-tagged (CCPGCC) proteins [24] was performed in 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM phosphate (pH 7.2), 10% glycerol, and 1 mM β-

mercaptoethanol. 200 μL of 10 μM FlAsH-tagged protein
were incubated with 1.5 equivalents of FlAsH-EDT2
(Lumio Green, Invitrogen) at 8°C for 2.5 h. We estimated
that the stock solution was supplied at a concentration of
approximately 1 mM. Excess label was removed by dialysis into the above buffer. Labelled proteins could be frozen and stored for at least a few months. The labelling
reaction could easily be reversed by adding DTT, so care
had to be taken to avoid DTT in buffers.

Kd for the binding of labelled DNA to protein [21]. For
competition experiments, a mixture of protein (at a concentration four times above the Kd value, measured by
direct titrations) and 20 nM labelled DNA were used as
analytes, and competitor DNA (50 μM) was titrated in
small steps. Over 3000 titrations were performed in total.
Data were analysed according to cooperative binding and
competition models using laboratory developed software
[15].

Sedimentation velocity experiments
We used a XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman)
equipped with an AVIV fluorescence detection system
(AVIV Biomedical). Experiments with C-terminally
FlAsH-tagged proteins and unlabelled QM-Hsp53 (using
an absorbance detection system) were done in 150 mM
NaCl, 25 mM phosphate (pH 7.2), 10% glycerol, BSA (0.2
mg/mL) and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol at 10°C. For fluorescence measurements, cells were pre-treated with a concentrated (1 mg/ml) solution of BSA and allowed to dry
before loading samples. Sample volume was 80-90 μL at
concentrations of 5-500 nM in SedVel60K fluorescence
velocity cells (Spin Analytical). At least 15 measurements
were done for each protein. Buffer density and viscosity
were calculated using SEDNTERP software. Data analysis
to obtain sedimentation coefficient traces was done with
SEDFIT software [55]. Since only the tetramer peak at 3 S
was detected in experiments with Hsp53 without the
FlAsH-tag, we ignored peaks at higher sedimentation coefficients found for FlAsH-tagged proteins as artefacts
caused by cross-linking of oxidised cysteines of the tag.
Fitting of sedimentation profiles to normal distributions
and Kd calculation was done with our own laboratory software to estimate the relative amount of dimers and
tetramers. The reported values for human p53 are somewhat lower than the values we have reported previously
[56]. Most likely, a change in the cell design resulting in
significantly lower surface area of exposed epoxy material
and pre-treatment of the cells with concentrated BSA solution minimised the adsorption of p53 proteins to the cell
wall, thereby increasing the fraction of material present in
solution.

Computational search for putative binding sites
The putative binding sites in the genome were located
using p53BindingSite software [15], available at http://
www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/dbv. In short, the DNA-binding
affinity was predicted for each position in the genome
using binding affinity positional matrices measured for
each protein studied, and positions with predicted affinity
higher than the cut-off value were selected. We used
human genome release 36.3, zebrafish genome release
10/06/2008 (International Human Genome Sequencing
Consortium), fruit fly genome release 5 (The FlyBase Consortium/Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project) and
mouse genome release 37 (Mouse Genome Sequencing
Consortium). Instead of Xenopus laevis we used the Xenopus tropicalis genome (release 4.1, DOE Joint Genome
Institute), as it is complete. We set the gap between both
half-sites of the RE to be 0 and 1.

Fluorescence anisotropy spectroscopy
All experiments were carried out in 96-well plates using a
Pherastar plate reader (BMG Labtech) equipped with a
Bravo 96-channel pipetting robot (Velocity 11) as previously described [15]. Buffer conditions for all experiments
were 25 mM NaPi, 225 mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 5 mM
DTT and 0.2 mg/mL BSA. Titrations were done at 22°C
and repeated at least three times. Direct titrations were
done as previously described [22] using 20 nM 5'Alexa488-GGACATGTCCGGACATGTCC labelled DNA
(Operon). The stock solution of 1.25 μM protein was
titrated in small amounts, which allows calculation of the
