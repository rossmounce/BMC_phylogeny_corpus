Abstract
Background: Protein phosphatases are the key components of a number of signaling pathways where they
modulate various cellular responses. In plants, protein phosphatases constitute a large gene family and are reportedly
involved in the regulation of abiotic stress responses and plant development. Recently, the whole complement of
protein phosphatases has been identified in Arabidopsis genome. While PP2C class of serine/threonine phosphatases
has been explored in rice, the whole complement of this gene family is yet to be reported.
Results: In silico investigation revealed the presence of 132-protein phosphatase-coding genes in rice genome.
Domain analysis and phylogenetic studies of evolutionary relationship categorized these genes into PP2A, PP2C, PTP,
DSP and LMWP classes. PP2C class represents a major proportion of this gene family with 90 members. Chromosomal
localization revealed their distribution on all the 12 chromosomes, with 42 genes being present on segmentally
duplicated regions and 10 genes on tandemly duplicated regions of chromosomes. The expression profiles of 128
genes under salinity, cold and drought stress conditions, 11 reproductive developmental (panicle and seed) stages
along with three stages of vegetative development were analyzed using microarray expression data. 46 genes were
found to be differentially expressing in 3 abiotic stresses out of which 31 were up-regulated and 15 exhibited downregulation. A total of 82 genes were found to be differentially expressing in different developmental stages. An
overlapping expression pattern was found for abiotic stresses and reproductive development, wherein 8 genes were
up-regulated and 7 down-regulated. Expression pattern of the 13 selected genes was validated employing real time
PCR, and it was found to be in accordance with the microarray expression data for most of the genes.
Conclusions: Exploration of protein phosphatase gene family in rice has resulted in the identification of 132 members,
which can be further divided into different classes phylogenetically. Expression profiling and analysis indicate the
involvement of this large gene family in a number of signaling pathways triggered by abiotic stresses and their possible
role in plant development. Our study will provide the platform from where; the expression pattern information can be
transformed into molecular, cellular and biochemical characterization of members belonging to this gene family.

Background
Plants constantly encounter a number of abiotic stresses
such as drought, cold, salinity, osmotic stress in the
environment. Plants have evolved complex molecular
mechanisms by which they adapt and tolerate these
adverse growth conditions. When they perceive stress

conditions, plant cells reprogram their cellular processes
by triggering a network of signaling events leading to
changes in gene expression and eventually altered cellular response. In the post-genomic era, the complete genome sequences of a number of plant species have led to
the identification of diverse gene families involved in
abiotic stress responses and have unveiled the presence
of intricate machinery that leads to the development of
tolerance or adaptation against adverse conditions.
Many signaling components such as second messengers,

sensor-relay, sensor-responders, and effectors and finally
the target proteins such as transcription factors, transporters and channel proteins have been implicated in
plant stress response.
Reversible protein phosphorylation mediated by
protein kinases and protein phosphatases is a major
event in signal transduction, regulating many biological
processes including cell cycle events, growth factor
response, hormone and other environmental stimuli,
metabolic control and developmental events [1-6].
During phosphorylation, a protein kinase adds a phosphate group to a substrate. Protein phosphatases
reverse this process by removing the phosphate group.
In many cases, the addition or removal of a phosphate
group to or from an enzyme either activates or deactivates the enzyme effectively. In this manner, protein
kinases and phosphatases play a critical role in controlling the activity of an enzyme and, as a result, regulate
the biochemical process in which the enzyme
participates.
Based on the amino acid residue they preferentially
dephosphorylate, protein phosphatases can be categorized into serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase.
The serine/threonine phosphatases were initially categorized into two groups, PP1 and PP2, based on their
substrate specificity and pharmacological properties.
PP1s are highly conserved and ubiquitous phosphatases
across all eukaryotes. In case of plants, there is only
limited knowledge about PP1 so far [7-9]. A PP1 gene
up-regulated by biotic stress was reported in Phaseolus
vulgaris [10]. In Arabidopsis, a family of nine PP1 genes
has been identified [8,11]. Although functional evidence
for these PP1 phosphatases has been difficult to obtain,
work with a PP1 phosphatase in Vicia faba has demonstrated its involvement in stomata opening in response
to the blue light [12]. The PP2 phosphatases have been
further subdivided into three classes based on their
requirement for divalent cations for the catalysis. PP2A
phosphatases do not require divalent cations, while
PP2B and PP2C require Ca2+ and Mg 2+ , respectively
[9]. Based on sequence and structural analysis, type one
(PP1), type 2A (PP2A), and type 2B (PP2B) protein
phosphatases are related enzymes and hence, are defined
as the PPP family. The type 2C protein phosphatases
(PP2C), pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase and other
Mg 2+ -dependent Ser/Thr phosphatases are closely
related and share no sequence homology with PPP and
thus, form a distinct group, the PPM family [13,14].
Despite their lack of sequence similarity, members of
the PPP and PPM families share a similar structural fold
[15], suggesting a common mechanism of catalysis.
However, even within the same family, significant structural diversity can be generated by the presence of
unique regulatory and targeting domains or by the

attachment of a regulatory subunit to the catalytic
subunit.
Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) super-family has
been classified into tyrosine-specific PTPs that act on
phosphotyrosine and dual-specificity protein tyrosine
phosphatase (DsPTP), which can dephosphorylate both
phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine
[16,17]. Unique three-dimensional structure of catalytic
domain and lack of sequence homology with protein
ser/thr phosphatases, indicate that PTPs evolved independently [18]. However, the highly conserved structure
of the catalytic domains within the PTP superfamily
suggests a common phosphate hydrolysis mechanism
[18]. All the members of the PTP superfamily carry the
signature motif of CX5R in their active site and cysteine
is required for PTP catalytic activity [18]. The low molecular weight protein tyr phosphatases (LMW-PTPs),
constituting an evolutionarily distinct group, which have
converged on a similar catalytic mechanism [19].
Like protein kinases, phosphatases from plants are also
expected to perform the pivotal functions in signal
transduction network at different developmental stages
of plant and under multiple stress conditions. Currently,
several research groups are engaged in deciphering the
involvement of different kinases such as CDPKs [20],
CIPKs [21,22], and MAPKs [23,24] in abiotic and biotic
stress signaling networks, in both Arabidopsis and rice.
Phosphatases are the essential kinase-counteracting
component in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes in
diverse signaling pathways. Moreover, most of the phosphatases have been studied in Arabidopsis and very few
have been functionally characterized based on their
expression in crop plants. Therefore, it is very crucial to
undertake a comprehensive study to understand the role
of stress and development regulated phosphatases in
rice. In principle, these phosphatases might be the logical candidates for testing an important biological reversible switch of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation in
these signaling pathways. Study of the expression
pattern of different protein phosphatase classes under
various stress conditions and in different plant organs
may provide insights into the underlying physiological,
biochemical and molecular mechanism of stress tolerance and regulation of development.
In spite of recent identification of the whole complement of protein phosphatases in Arabidopsis [25] and
genome-wide analysis of PP2C class of phosphatases in
both Arabidopsis and rice [26], knowledge is minuscule
about the expression, structural and functional aspects
of protein phosphatases in the regulation of plant
growth and development. Also, it is quite obvious that
the genome of rice will also comprise phosphatases
other than PP2C as found in the genome of Arabidopsis
[25], which might play very significant role in plant

development and stress tolerance. These rationale and
availability of the rice genome sequence, online
databases and in silico search tools enticed us to carry
out a detailed analysis towards the identification and
expression profiling of protein phosphatases in rice.
In this study, we have identified the full complement
of protein phosphatases in rice genome, reporting 132
protein phosphatase-coding genes as well as their structural analysis and expression profiles. We categorized
them into different classes by analyzing the catalytic
domains they harbor and used phylogenetic analysis to
show the relation among the members of various subfamilies. Subsequently, we analyzed the genes for segmental and tandem duplication events, which may have
been the likely force for the expansion of this gene
family in rice. A detailed expression analysis for OsPP
(Oryza sativa protein phosphatase) genes was done
under various environmental stresses as well as during
various developmental stages which included vegetative
growth, panicle and seed development. This expression
analysis will be very useful to envisage the functional
role of these genes in abiotic stress signaling, stress
tolerance and plant development.

Methods
Identification of protein phosphatases in rice genome

The database search was performed using keyword
“phosphatase” in RGAP-TIGR (Rice Genome Annotation
Project - The Institute of Genomic Research) version 5.0
[27]. This resulted in 321 putative phosphatases, which
were then confirmed by the presence of the protein phosphatase domain using SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) database [28], using amino acid
sequences as query. Out of 321 putative phosphatases,
only 118 were found to have the protein phosphatase
domain. Keyword search performed on PhosphaBase
database [29] fetched 11 new protein phosphatases.
Moreover, the TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information
Resource) database [30], PhosphaBase, Saccharomyces
genome database [31] and Populus database [32] were
mined for Arabidopsis, human, yeast and Populus
genomes, respectively, to extract putative phosphatases.
Subsequently, the putative entries were confirmed by the
presence of phosphatase domain using SMART database.
A common profile was generated from the amino acid
sequences of the phosphatase domains of all the 5 organisms (rice, Arabidopsis, human, yeast and Populus). An
HMM (Hidden Markov Model) profile was generated
using domains employing HMMER software [33]. This
was used as query to search version 5 of RGAP rice
pseudomolecules database http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/
pseudomolecules/info.shtml and the KOME (Knowledge
based Molecular Biological Encyclopedia) full-length cDNA
database [34] to identify similar sequences, followed by

screening for unique entries from two databases. The
strategy fetched 141 and 154 unique entries from RGAP
and KOME, respectively. All the 141 protein sequences
thus obtained from RGAP were again validated for the presence of phosphatase domain employing SMART and
InterPro [35] domain analysis tools. Interestingly, 10 out of
the 141 were found to be devoid of phosphatase domain,
and this led to the identification of 131 protein phosphatases. Protein sequences of 154 unique entries from HMM
search in KOME databases were used to BLAST in RGAP
rice genome database setting a criterion of ≥ 92% identity.
This search resulted in 14 new RGAP locus IDs and these
new proteins were also analyzed for the presence of phosphatase domain. Only one out of 14 was found to have
phosphatase domain as suggested by InterPro scan.
Nomenclature and chromosomal localization

Genes are named as OsPPx where Os indicates Oryza
sativa, PP indicates protein phosphatase and x is the
number assigned to a particular gene (from 1 to 132) in
the phosphatase complement. OsPP genes were mapped
on chromosomes by identifying their positions as given
in RGAP database. Information regarding various gene
attributes such as ORF size, number of amino acid, number of introns, alternative splicing, expression evidence
(cDNA or EST) were collected from RGAP release 5.
Phylogenetic analysis of OsPPs

Phosphatase domain sequences of rice obtained from
SMART database were used for multiple sequence alignment employing ClustalX (version 1.81program) [36].
An un-rooted neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree
was constructed with the aligned sequences in ClustalX
with default parameters. Phylogenetic NJ tree was also
made using aligned domain sequences of both, rice and
Arabidopsis together. Bootstrap analysis was performed
using 1000 replicates. The trees thus obtained were
viewed using TREEVIEW 1.6.6 software [37].
Gene duplication

The duplicated genes were found from the RGAP segmental duplication database http://rice.plantbiology.msu.
edu/segmental_dup/100kb/segdup_100kb.shtml. Genes
separated by 5 or fewer genes were considered tandemly
duplicated. The distance between these genes on a
chromosome was calculated and the homology in terms
of percentage similarity in the amino acid sequences of
these gene products was computed employing MegAlign
software 5.07© [38].
Plant material, growth conditions and stress treatment

Tissue at different stages of panicle and seed development was harvested from field-grown rice plants (Oryza
sativa ssp. Indica var. IR64) according to Ray et al. [39].

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:435
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/435

Collected panicles were frozen in liquid nitrogen
immediately after excision to minimize the effect of
wounding on individual florets. Treatments for cold,
salinity and dehydration stresses to 7-days-old rice
seedlings were also given according to Ray et al. [39].
To test the validity of stress treatments given to the
seedlings, microarray expression profile was generated
(additional file 1 and 2) for few known stress inducible
genes [40].
Microarray based gene expression analysis

Genome wide microarray analysis was performed
according to Agarwal et al. [41], to generate the expression profile of OsPPs. The samples for the microarray
experiment included three vegetative stages (mature leaf,
7 days old seedling and their roots), 11 reproductive
stages (P1-P6 and S1-S5; representing panicle and seed
developmental stages, respectively) and three abiotic
stress conditions, i.e. cold, salt, and dehydration. RNA
was isolated from three biological replicates for each
stage/treated tissue and microarray experiments were
carried out using 51 Affymetrix Gene Chip Rice Genome Arrays (Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO, platform
accession number GPL2025) as described. The raw data
(*.cel) files generated from all the chips were imported
to Array Assist 5.0 software (Stratagene, USA) for
detailed analysis. To stabilize the variation of data from
all the chips, normalization of the raw data was performed using GC-RMA (Gene Chip Robust Multi-array
Analysis) algorithm [42]. Normalized signal intensity
values were log transformed and averages of the three
biological replicates for each sample were used for
further analysis. Student’s t-test was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (fold change > 2, at
P-value ≤ 0.05) with respect to all vegetative stages in
the case of reproductive development and 7 days old
unstressed seedling in the case of stress samples. The
up- or down-regulated genes in any tissue were calculated from the average of log of normalized signal
values. The data for only one probe set per gene (generally 3’ most) was used for the analysis. The expression
of a particular gene was considered absent if the normalized signal value from the corresponding probe set
was < 7. The data was base line transformed by taking
the mature leaf and the seedling as the base lines for
reproductive stages and stress samples, respectively. On
the basis of expression profiles, genes were grouped by
using self-organizing maps (SOM) and distance matrix
Euclidian on rows (developmental expression) and both
rows and columns (stress expression) with 100 maximum iterations. The microarray expression data have
been deposited in the gene expression omnibus (GEO)
database at NCBI under the series accession numbers
GSE6893 and GSE6901.

Expression analysis by MPSS

MPSS (massively parallel signature sequence) database
[43] was explored to obtain the expression profiles of
genes that were not represented on the Affymetrix rice
Gene Chip®. Data was retrieved from 17 bp signatures
from selected libraries. Only those signatures, which
were unique to the genome and transcribed from the
respective strand of the gene (Classes 1 and 2), included
in the analysis. A TPM cut-off of > 3 was set to avoid
the background signal. The normalized transcript abundance values per million (TPM) were used to assess the
expression profile.
Real time PCR analysis

To validate the microarray data for a few selected genes
showing differential expression pattern under abiotic
stress conditions, real time PCR was performed using
two biological replicates. Primers were made for all the
selected genes preferentially, from 3’ end, employing
PRIMER EXPRESS (PE Applied Biosystems, USA), with
default settings. Each primer was checked using BLAST
tool of NCBI for its specificity for the respective gene,
and also was confirmed by dissociation curve analysis
after the PCR reaction (Additional file 3).
4 μg of DNase treated total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA in 100 μl of reaction volume
using high-capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). SYBRGreen PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, USA) was used to determine the expression
levels for the genes in ABI Prism 7000 Sequence detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA). To normalize
the variance among samples, ACTIN was used as the
endogenous control. Relative expression values were
calculated employing ΔΔCt method and normalized the
data against the maximum average expression value
from microarray.

Results
Identification of protein phosphatases in rice genome

Keyword search from RGAP resulted in 321 putative
phosphatases, which were narrowed down to 118 after
domain analysis. During domain analysis various other
domains such as S_TKc (ser/thr kinase catalytic
domain), FHA (forkhead associated domain), TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat), EF-hand (calcium binding motif)
were found to be present in putative candidates along
with the phosphatase catalytic domains, PP2Ac, PP2Cc,
PTPc, DSPc, PTP_DSPc and LMWPc (Additional file 4).
Keyword search in PhosphaBase revealed 11 additional
protein phosphatases. From HMM search in RGAP, we
found 141 unique entries. When analyzed for the presence of conserved domains employing SMART and
InterPro, we found that 10 of these were devoid of any
and/or phosphatase domain, therefore, 131 protein

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:435
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/435

phosphatases were confirmed by this approach. Similar
HMM search in KOME database resulted in 154 unique
entries. BLAST search in RGAP with the amino acid
sequences of these unique entries, resulted in 14 new
genes. Domain analysis of these new 14 entries by
SMART did not reveal phosphatases domain in any of
the genes. However, similar analysis using InterPro
showed the presence of PP domain (PTP_DSPc) in one
(OsPP62) of the 14 genes. Hence, the total number of
identified protein phosphatase coding gene is 132.
Organization of rice protein phosphatase gene family

Protein phosphatase genes extracted by keyword search
and HMM profile search were categorized into 5 classes
depending on the presence of various domains. PP2C
with highest number of members formed a major class
of 90 genes. PP2A and DSP comprised of 17 and 23
members, respectively, while PTP and LMWP contained
one member each. The intron-exon structure analysis
revealed a variation of 0 to 20 introns per gene, with
about 70% genes containing at least 4 introns. Expression evidences were available for 91% of the genes in
terms of ESTs or full-length cDNAs (Additional file 5).
Expression of 97% of the OsPP family members could
be derived from microarray and MPSS based studies.

members present on largest chromosome 1 (Figure 3).
On the other hand, only 5 genes were localized on chromosome 8 and 10 each. A total of 42 OsPP genes were
present on segmentally duplicated chromosomal regions
(Table 1). Out of these 42 genes, 40 had their counterparts on duplicated segments of the chromosome. On
the criterion of separation by less than 5 intervening
genes and ≥ 50% homology at protein level, a total of 10
genes were found to be tandemly duplicated, falling into 5
groups with each group comprising of 2 genes (Table 2).
All the tandemly duplicated genes were localized only on
two chromosomes, 4 pairs on chromosome 2 and one pair
on chromosome 6. Categorically, segmentally duplicated
genes were found to be distributed as 13 pairs PP2Cs, 4
pairs DSPs, 3 pairs PP2As, whereas all the tandemly
duplicated genes were PP2Cs (Figure 3).
Expression profiles of OsPPs under abiotic stress
conditions

To find out the evolutionary relationship among the
members of the protein phosphatase gene family, phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on the catalytic
phosphatase domain. All the members of PP2C class of
phosphatases formed a single major clade. This clade
could be divided into 11 subclades based on ≥ 50%
bootstrap support. Each subclade is representing a subfamily of PP2C and is designated from A-K according to
Xue et al [26]. PP2A and DSP were two other major
classes and formed two separate major clades, with each
clade containing all the members of respective classes
(domain sequence for OsPP62 could not be found and
hence not represented in the phylogenetic tree). Single
genes belonging to LMWP (OsPP104) and PTP
(OsPP127) classes were positioned separately (Figure 1,
Additional file 6). Investigation of the relationship
between rice and Arabidopsis protein phosphatase gene
family revealed very similar tree topologies and subfamily organization to individual rice tree (Figure 2).

Expression profiles of OsPPs in 7-days-old seedlings
were analyzed under three abiotic stress conditions (salt,
cold and drought). After defining a criterion of fold
change value > 2 (either up- or down-regulated) in comparison to untreated 7-days-old seedling control, a total
of 46 OsPP genes were found to be differentially expressing (Figure 4). Out of these 46 genes, 31 were up-regulated and 15 were down-regulated in any of these above
mentioned abiotic stresses. 6 OsPP genes (OsPP2,
OsPP40, OsPP46, OsPP48, OsPP50 and OsPP55) were
up-regulated whereas none of the genes was down-regulated in all the three stress conditions tested. We did
not find any gene, which was up-regulated in both salt
and cold or in both cold and drought stress together
but 13 OsPP genes were up-regulated in salt and
drought stress together. On the other hand, 1 and 2
genes were down-regulated in salt and drought or cold
and drought stress together, respectively (Figure 5,
Additional file 7). Observation for genes, expressing
exclusively in any one of the three abiotic stresses identified 0, 2 and 8 genes getting up-regulated, whereas 1, 1
and 11 genes being down-regulated under salt, cold and
drought stress, respectively (Figure 5a, b). MPSS expression data analysis revealed one more gene (OsPP118),
which was not found on the Affymetrix gene chip, to be
up-regulated under high salinity conditions (Additional
file 8).

Chromosomal localization and gene duplication

Expression profiles of OsPPs during development

The rice PPs were mapped to RGAP pseudomolecules
(version 5; chromosome 1-12) based on the coordinates
of RGAP loci http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/pseudomolecules/info.shtml. Rice protein phosphatases were
variably distributed on all chromosomes, with the maximum 24 members located on chromosome 2 and 17

Genome wide expression profiles for rice OsPPs genes
during development were generated by analyzing microarray expression data obtained from Affymetrix rice
whole genome arrays. Corresponding probe sets for 128
genes were found on Affymetrix gene chip; hence their
expression profile could be analyzed. For expression

analysis during reproductive development, 6 panicle
stages (P1-P6) and 5 seed (S1-S5) development stages
were compared with three combined vegetative developmental stages namely mature leaf, root and seedling
(Figure 6). In total, 82 OsPP genes were found to be
expressing differentially (with fold change > 2) during
various developmental stages (Additional file 9). Out of
these, 36 and 31 were up-regulated in panicle and seed
tissues, respectively. Transcript levels for 18 OsPPs were
commonly up-regulated in both the reproductive developmental phases. There were 10 and 4 genes, which were
exclusively up-regulated during panicle and seed development, respectively. On the other hand 34 and 35 OsPPs
were found to be down-regulated during panicle and
seed development, respectively. 7 genes were commonly

down-regulated in both panicle and seed stages together,
whereas 4 genes each were exclusively down-regulated in
panicles and seeds, separately (Figure 5c, d).
To understand the relationship between abiotic stresses and different developmental stages, we compared the
expression profiles during various stages of reproductive
development and under stresses. Among the genes
expressing differentially both under abiotic stresses and
during developmental stages, 8 were up-regulated
whereas 7 were down-regulated together (Figure 5c, d).
In addition, 4 genes were up-regulated in all the three
abiotic stresses whereas they were down-regulated in
most of the panicle development stages.
Among the OsPP genes that were found to express
differentially under abiotic stresse conditions, 13 were

validated experimentally using real time PCR. 10 OsPP
genes out of 13 showed anticipated expression pattern,
and could be correlated with microarray expression pattern. However, one of the genes, OsPP9, which was
found to be down-regulated in microarray data, showed
a contradictory expression pattern and was up-regulated
in real time expression analysis. Moreover, two genes,
OsPP48 and OsPP50, showed higher expression levels as
determined by the real time PCR analysis when compared to microarray data (Figure 7).
Expression profiles of duplicated OsPPs

The expression pattern of OsPP genes present in segmentally duplicated regions and in tandem duplication

was analyzed. Although, the entire duplicated gene pairs
code for the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatases,
varying expression pattern was observed. Out of the
20 pairs of segmentally duplicated genes, probe sets
were available for 15 pairs on Affymetrix gene chip.
The average signal values for all the samples (developmental as well abiotic stresses), are presented as an
area-diagram (Figure 8). The expression pattern was
very much similar for 11 pairs of genes indicating retention of function. However, the amplitude of expression
varied in paired partners, which may be due to the fact
that gene with low level of expression would tend to
lose its function in due course of evolution. In two
pairs (OsPP14:OsPP77 and OsPP40:OsPP84), one of the

genes had almost negligible expression exhibiting
pseudo-functionalization. For 2 pairs of gene (OsPP19:
OsPP90 and OsPP22:OsPP87), expression pattern was
very divergent for most of the tissue tested, indicating
neo-functionalization. Expression analysis was also done
for tandemly duplicated OsPP genes. From a total of 10
genes present in tandem duplication forming 5 groups,
probe sets for only 3 pairs were available on Affymetrix
gene chip. Two pairs of genes, OsPP32:OsPP33 and
OsPP34:OsPP35 were having highly similar expression
pattern and hence retention of expression, whereas, one

pair OsPP86:OsPP87 showed divergent expression
profile.

Discussion
Protein phosphatases are a group of enzymes found
ubiquitously in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This
group of proteins is encoded by a large gene family in
plants and is involved in the regulation of a number of
cellular processes. This background knowledge
prompted us to go for the identification of the full complement and expression profiling of this important gene

full complement of protein phosphatases in Arabidopsis

Higher number of protein phosphatase genes in rice can

the expansion of this gene family in rice. Based on
domain search and phylogenetic analysis, we report the
presence of 90 PP2C genes in rice representing largest
phosphatase class, as already established in plants. Therefore, we are able to show a higher number of PP2C genes
in rice than those given by a recent genome wide study
(only 78 and 80 PP2C genes were reported in rice and
Arabidopsis, respectively) [26]. Also, our dataset contains
all the PP2C genes reported by them. In the present
study, this higher number of PP2Cs in rice can be attributed to the genome wide search done using the HMM
model. The large proportion of PP2C class in rice and
Arabidopsis indicates the diverse role played by this gene
family in plants. PP2A is another important class of ser/
thr phosphatases and we could find 17 members belonging to this class in rice. Previously, 5 isoforms of catalytic
subunit of PP2A have been reported in Arabidopsis
[44-46]. As evident from previous study [47], we also
could not find any gene belonging to PP2B class. Tyrosine phosphorylation is less common in plants as compared to ser/thr phosphorylations. In accordance with
this observation, we could identify a single tyrosine specific phosphatase gene harboring PTP domain. Studies in
Arabidopsis also identified only a single gene encoding
the PTP [25,48]. Animals are known to have a large
family of receptor tyr kinases, which interact with ligands
at the plasma membrane and subsequently mediate tyr

phosphorylation of large array of downstream targets.
Plant genomes do not encode such receptor tyr kinases
and hence, tyr phosphorylation in plants occurs less frequently than in animals [49,50]. We could also find several DSPs, which form another branch of protein tyrosine
phosphatase class. In an earlier study, 22 DSPs were
reported in Arabidopsis [51]. The number of protein tyrosine phosphatase genes in Arabidopsis and in rice is
much lower than in humans, where more than 100 members of PTP superfamily, which including approximately
60 DSPs, have been reported [51]. Keeping in mind the
fact that Arabidopsis has twice as many protein kinases
than humans [52] and rice has even more [53], it is noteworthy that there is huge difference in the number of
PTPs and DSPs between plants and humans. This implies
that either the tyrosine phosphorylation components are
limited or that the plant PTPs or DSPs could target many
sites in the signaling processes.
During domain analysis, few other domains and motifs
were found to be associated with main phosphatase
domains, which included S_TKc (ser/thr kinase catalytic
domain), FHA (forkhead associated domain), TPR (tetratricopeptide repeats) and EF-hand (calcium binding
motif) (Additional file 5). These domains might be
involved in Ca 2+ binding, structural organization or
nuclear signaling. TPR (tetratricopeptide repeats) are the
structural motifs found in a wide range of proteins.
These mediate protein-to-protein interaction, thereby
mediating the assembly of multi-protein complexes [54].
This type of domains has been found in a particular
class (PP5) of protein phosphatases [55]. In PP5 phosphatases, these domains mediate the interaction with G
proteins [56] and the small GTPase Rac protein [57].
FHA is a phosphoprotein-binding domain and has been
found to be associated with a number of signaling proteins that interact with the partners, phosphorylated at
serine/threonine residue. KAPP (kinase associated protein phosphatase) from Arabidopsis harbors this domain,
where it has been found to play a crucial role in the
interaction with RLKs (receptor like kinases) resulting in
negative regulation of RLK signaling pathways, which
are important for plant development [58]. During this
analysis, we could find two PP2C genes (OsPP58 and
OsPP74) with FHA domain, which turned out to be the
kinase associated protein phosphatase (KAPP). The
same genes were also found out as KAPP by one of the
studies [59], with RGAP IDs, LOC_Os7g11010 and
LOC_Os03g59530. This type of phosphatase gene has
also been reported in Arabidopsis during the screening
of a cDNA library for interaction with a RLK (receptor
like protein kinase) protein kinase domain and has been
finally characterized as the first downstream regulator of
an RLK [16]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close evolutionary relations among the members of the same class

and some degree of divergence from members of other
phosphatase classes. PP2Cs were found to be distributed
into several sub-clades inside a major clade, which
divide this family into various subfamilies. This is in
accordance with the previous studies [26] and shows
some degree of divergence even within the members of
same class. The divergence might have resulted due to
the presence of unique regulatory and targeting domains
or by the attachment of regulatory subunits to the catalytic subunit of phosphatase [9]. To find out if phylogenetic relatedness could be correlated with functional
conservations, as a first step their expression profiles
were compared. Functionally, the phylogenetic structure

explained that 6 genes (OsPP10, OsPP12, OsPP48,
OsPP76, OsPP79 and OsPP108) with high expression
values (up-regulated) under abiotic stresses were found
to fall in the subfamily A of PP2C class and 2 genes
(OsPP40 and OsPP72) in subfamily G. Two genes
(OsPP87 and OsPP91) with higher expression values
during the stages of panicle and seed development were
found to fall in subfamily F2. On the other hand, all the
genes from subfamily B were significantly down-regulated in most of the stages of panicle and seed development. This indicates that genes involved in similar
functions have evolved from a common ancestor and
are organized in closely related group. Moreover, the

similar phylogenetic tree topologies of Arabidopsis and
rice (Figure 2) suggest a common ancestry and evolutionary lineage for this gene family in two plant species
from eudicots and monocots.
A number of OsPP genes were found to be duplicated
either segmentally or in tandem, suggesting a role of
chromosome gene duplication in the expansion and evolution of this gene family in rice. Duplicated OsPPs
showed varying expression pattern during development
and under abiotic stresses, which can be attributed to
lack of intense selection pressure and need for

diversification [60-63]. Segmentally duplicated genes are
known to display a greater degree of functional divergence [61]. Consistent with this observation, duplicated
genes in our study also exhibited pseudo-functionalization, neo-functionalization and retention of expression.
Most of the segmentally duplicated gene pairs, retaining
essentially similar expression profiles were found to
have an amino acid level homology in the range of
62-94%. Therefore, we could correlate this high level of
homology with the similarity of expression pattern in
these gene pairs. The expression profiles were relatively

intensity values from 17 stages of development/stress conditions. Gene pairs have been grouped into retention of expression, neo-

less congruent in the case of tandemly duplicated genes,
which is also evident from the low sequence similarity
in the coding region and their respective regulatory
sequences as well. Two of the segmentally duplicated
gene pairs, OsPP19:OsPP90 and OsPP22:OsPP87, with
relatively high levels of homology (83% and 56.7%,
respectively), showed a complete divergent expression
profile. This indicates that these genes might have
undergone significant diversification after the duplication of the respective genomic segments, leading to
neo-functionalization for the paired partners.
To find the probable explanation for this divergent
expression pattern for duplicated genes, 1 kb upstream
region from translation start site was explored. In silico
promoter analysis revealed that 6 out of 11 segmentally
duplicated gene pairs had 36-50% similarity in their regulatory elements (Additional file 10). The variability in
the cis-acting regulatory elements of these genes might
have resulted in the divergence in the amplitude of
expression [64]. On the other hand, genes with striking
differences in their expression pattern and those exhibiting neo-functionalization had only 14-21% similarity in
their regulatory elements. It should also be kept in the
mind that the eukaryotic genes with multiple introns
and exons, apart from transcription level, are also regulated at the level of gene splicing. Many times alternative splicing leads to the generation of new protein
isoforms and thus increases the genome complexity
[65]. Plants have been shown to display a great variety
in alternative splicing that is mainly of the intron retention type, whereas exon skip type is preferred in animals
[66]. It has been shown that in rice 21.2% of the coding
genome displayed alternative splicing [67] and its
regulation by environmental stresses has been shown in
Arabidopsis [68].
Keeping in view that the expression profile of a gene
is the reflection of its functional relevance and provides
a clue to get a deep insight into its functional role, genome-wide expression profiling of protein phosphatase
gene family was carried out, using whole genome indica
rice microarrays for vegetative, panicle and seed development stages; and three abiotic stress conditions (salt,
cold and drought). In our analysis, a significant proportion of the OsPPs showed differential expression under
various abiotic stresses and selected stages of panicle
and seed development. The temporal and spatial display
of gene expression might reflect the attainment of specialized functions by OsPPs. Our expression analysis
revealed a differential as well overlapping pattern under
abiotic stresses, such as cold, drought, and salinity.
Earlier studies also suggest that the same gene can be
activated by different triggers in a distinct signaling
pathway [69,70]. This type of overlapping expression
pattern among these genes might be the result of a

Page 15 of 18

common signaling component such as calcium, acting
as “Hub” in the pathways triggered by different stress
stimuli. This hub might act as a converging point for
different stress signaling pathways and might activate
the cis-acting regulatory elements of a respective gene
under different abiotic stress conditions. Moreover, different pathways may share common components, which
might be acting as “Node” and radiate towards more
than one pathway or do crosstalk. Hence, may explain
the overlapping expression patterns [71]. As it is well
known that one of the earliest response to stress signals
is manifestation of increased cellular calcium in plants
[72,73], leading to activation of intermediate components such as calcium sensors including CaM (calmodulin), CBL (calcineurine B-like) and CDPK (calcium
dependent protein kinases), which then modulate the
activity of transcription factors, causing changes in gene
expression. This hypothesis has been also supported by
previous studies, where drought and cold treatments
were shown to activate a single gene RD29A expression
by activating the same cis-acting element, DRE/CRT
[74]. However, different transcription factors like DREB1
and DREB2 were speculated to be involved in drought
and cold responses, linking drought and cold pathways
to RD29A expression [69,70]. In the light of these
experimental evidences, it can be said that similar “Hub
and Nodes” combination may be involved in stress signaling pathways constituting these phosphatases and the
same cis-acting regulatory elements may be controlling
the same gene in different signaling pathways, which
could account for such an overlapping expression pattern. In our global gene expression analysis, where the
entire spectrum of the reproductive development was
analyzed by microarray based gene expression, we have
been able to identify the genes relevant to the panicle
and seed development. We could identify several OsPPs,
which were commonly up- or down-regulated in both
panicle and seed (at various developmental stages),
whereas a subset of genes expressed differentially either
in panicle or seed specifically. Since each reproductive
stage analyzed in this study represented a complex set
of tissues and cell types, the magnitude of the change in
expression values of individual genes in a particular cell
type may not be evident completely. Therefore, even a
2-fold estimated increase in the expression value could
have high significance [41], as it would actually magnify
several folds if only a particular cell-type or tissue was
considered [74,75]. Here, the data shows that the genes
up-regulated in narrow windows of reproductive development do not have very high expression signals, implying that their expression could be limited to specific cell
types [76,77]. In our analysis, we have also attempted to
figure out which genes have overlapping expression pattern in abiotic stresses and reproductive development,

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:435
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/435

and interestingly found several genes commonly up- and
down-regulated both under abiotic stresses and various
stages of panicle and seed development. All the up-regulated genes belong to PP2C class whereas among the
down-regulated ones, a subset of genes was from PP2C,
PP2A and DSP classes. Such phosphatases with overlapping expression pattern were also reported by Yu et al.
[78] where they showed that two PP2A catalytic subunit
genes from rice, OsPP2A-1 and OsPP2A-3, had high
expression level in stem and flower and low level in
leaves [78]. Moreover, OsPP2A-1 was also highly
expressed in roots but not OsPP2A-3. Transcript levels
of OsPP2A-1 in roots and OsPP2A-3 in stems were
found to be higher at the maturation and young stages,
respectively. Expression level of both the genes was high
in leaves subjected to drought and high salinity stress,
whereas heat stress decreased the expression level of
OsPP2A-1 in stems and induced OsPP2A-3 in all organs.
These findings indicated that the two PP2Ac genes were
subjected to developmental and stress-related regulation.
This type of overlapping expression pattern in stress
and developmental conditions can be attributed to some
cis-acting regulatory elements, such as ABRE, which
might be regulating both stress and development since
desiccation is an integral part of both of these events. It
is also well known that during the later stages of seed
maturation, the developmentally programmed dehydration event is triggered leading to dormancy. Such dehydration events are mediated by phytohormone ABA,
which also mediates drought and osmotic stress
responses. Recently, it has been shown by triple mutant
analysis that three SnRK2 protein kinases (SRK2D,
SRK2E and SRK2I) are involved and essential in controlling the ABA mediated seed development in Arabidopsis
[79]. Phosphatases such as ABI1 and ABI2, which halt
ABA signaling, might also interfere in developmental
processes, especially in the maturing phase of seed
development, possibly by interacting with these SnRK2
protein kinases and blocking their signaling.

Conclusions
Conclusively, this study presents a comprehensive
account of protein phosphatase encoding genes and provides an insight into the phylogenetic relationship, organization, and gene duplications. Expression profiling of
OsPP gene family has unraveled their probable functions
during stress and development and has provided a platform to adopt genetic, physiological and molecular
approaches for explication of the specific functions of
candidate protein phosphatase genes in rice.
Future prospects
Identification and expression profiling of whole complement of protein phosphatases in rice under abiotic stress

Page 16 of 18

and reproductive development has set the stage for
answering several questions such as: What are the different stress signaling pathways in which various phosphatases are involved in rice? Whether particular types
of phosphatases are confined to one particular signaling
pathway or do they crosstalk with other signaling pathways? Whether the expression of a particular phosphatase is tissue and development specific or ubiquitous
throughout the plant? Identification of developmentally
regulated phosphatases may prompt studies involving
promoter characterization. By utilizing such information,
rice varieties can be generated, which can withstand and
adapt to adverse environmental stresses like cold,
drought and salinity at a particular developmental stage
such as panicle formation and seed development.
