Abstract
Background: In recent years, several new hypotheses on phylogenetic relations among
arthropods have been proposed on the basis of DNA sequences. One of the challenged hypotheses
is the monophyly of hexapods. This discussion originated from analyses based on mitochondrial
DNA datasets that, due to an unusual positioning of Collembola, suggested that the hexapod body
plan evolved at least twice. Here, we re-evaluate the position of Collembola using ribosomal
protein gene sequences.
Results: In total 48 ribosomal proteins were obtained for the collembolan Folsomia candida. These
48 sequences were aligned with sequence data on 35 other ecdysozoans. Each ribosomal protein
gene was available for 25% to 86% of the taxa. However, the total sequence information was
unequally distributed over the taxa and ranged between 4% and 100%. A concatenated dataset was
constructed (5034 inferred amino acids in length), of which ~66% of the positions were filled.
Phylogenetic tree reconstructions, using Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Parsimony, and Bayesian
methods, resulted in a topology that supports monophyly of Hexapoda.
Conclusion: Although ribosomal proteins in general may not evolve independently, they once
more appear highly valuable for phylogenetic reconstruction. Our analyses clearly suggest that
Hexapoda is monophyletic. This underpins the inconsistency between nuclear and mitochondrial
datasets when analyzing pancrustacean relationships. Caution is needed when applying
mitochondrial markers in deep phylogeny.

Background
General hypotheses on arthropod phylogeny are rapidly
being altered by DNA sequence data [1-3]. For instance,
the Atelocerata concept held that hexapods and myriapods are united in one clade, but under the influence of
molecular data (e.g. [4]) this concept was replaced by the

view that crustaceans and hexapods constitute a monophyletic group, which is known as Pancrustacea (e.g.
[2,3,5]).
Another recently proposed, but still highly debated viewpoint is the diphyletic origin of Hexapoda, which was iniPage 1 of 10

tially raised by Nardi and co-workers in 2003 [6]. Based
on four mitochondrial genes, they [6] observed that two
species of Collembola (Tetrodontophora bielanensis and
Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni) branched off before the other
pancrustacean groups that were included in their study
(Insecta and Crustacea), suggesting paraphyly of Hexapoda. Their thesis was that the six-legged body plan of Collembola and other hexapods evolved at least twice: once
in the group of wingless hexapods and another time in the
true insects.
The conclusions of Nardi et al. [6] resulted in a vivid scientific debate, and many studies have addressed the phylogenetic placement of Collembola since then. Some
authors focused on mitochondrial sequences, others analyzed nuclear genes. Additional mitochondrial sequences
confirmed that, due to the placement of Collembola separate from the other hexapods, Hexapoda are indeed not
monophyletic [3,7]. However, after thorough analyses
exploring the effects of outgroup and gene choice,
sequence handling and optimality criteria on inferred
trees, Cameron and co-workers [8] concluded that the
mitochondrial data as available at the time were inadequate to fully resolve hexapod relationships [8]. Hassinin
[9] arrived at a similar conclusion in a more recent study
focusing on the effects of reverse strand-bias. Most
recently, Carapelli and co-workers [10] reported new analyses on a very large dataset, consisting of no fewer than a
hundred almost-complete mitochondrial genomes. These
new analyses, which were based on a novel model of
amino acid sequence evolution (MtPan), supported the
non-monophyly of hexapod groups.
It has gradually become clear in pancrustacean phylogeny
that nuclear and mitochondrial datasets tell different stories, and often result in different conclusions [10].
Remarkably, studies that addressed the question using
nuclear genomic data (ribosomal RNA and proteinencoding genes) indicate that the Collembola group
between crustaceans and insects and that Hexapoda is
monophyletic [2,5,11-18]. However, most of those studies included a relatively small number of loci [2], most
likely because obtaining data on protein-encoding DNA
sequences is not always straightforward for groups for
which little genomic information is available. Here we try
to fill this gap by re-evaluating the position of Collembola
using a relatively large number of nuclear protein-encoding sequences that are, although all for ribosomal proteins, assumed to be distributed throughout the genome
(see for example [19]).
Several authors have shown that publicly available data
can be useful when conducting a large-scale phylogenetic
study (eg. [20]), and that expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
can be extremely valuable for phylogenetic purposes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/83

[21,22]. Here, we combine data from a recently finished
EST sequencing project on the collembolan Folsomia candida [23], with data on 34 ecdysozoan species (Chelicerata, Hexapoda, Tardigrada, Nematoda and Crustacea)
available in the public GenBank repository [24], and with
data from a smaller EST dataset of the collembolan Orchesella cincta. We focus on ribosomal proteins to prevent the
problem of analyzing paralogous genes (sensu [21]).

Results
In total, gene-sequences for 48 ribosomal proteins were
obtained from the Folsomia candida EST dataset. This is
almost two-thirds of the total set of 79 ribosomal proteins
[19] found in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Four
D. melanogaster ribosomal protein sequences (RpL15,
RpL32, RpL36 and RpL39) showed high similarity with
two, instead of one F. candida transcript cluster in the EST
dataset. Comparison of the F. candida transcripts with
those of D. melanogaster revealed insertions/deletions
resulting in frame shifts in one of the two F. candida EST
clusters for RpL15, RpL32 and RpL36. Transcripts with a
frame-shift were discarded. Two highly diverse F. candida
EST clusters (one consisting of six EST sequences and one
singleton sequence) showed homology with D. melanogaster RpL39. The F. candida RpL39 singleton sequence
was excluded from further analysis. The discarded RpL15,
RpL32, RpL36 and RpL39 transcripts may stem from
duplications in the F. candida genome (for example, in D.
melanogaster nine ribosomal proteins are represented by
two separate functional genes [19]), or from constitutively
expressed pseudogenes. This situation may be analogous
to the apparent amplification of many mammalian ribosomal proteins; for instance, the human genome contains
over 2000 ribosomal protein pseudogenes [25]. Still, it
seems that only one copy of each ribosomal protein is
actually functional [26,27].
As described in the methods section, the remaining 48
ribosomal protein sequences were used to retrieve ribosomal protein sequence information on 32 additional
ecdysozoan species. In addition, ribosomal protein
sequences of D. melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Caenorhabditis elegans were retrieved from the Ribosomal Protein
Gene-database (RPG; [28]). The number of usable (partial) ribosomal protein gene sequences that were obtained
per species ranged from two (4% of the 48 genes: Amblyomma variegatum) to 48 (100% of the 48 genes: D. melanogaster and Apis mellifera) (Table 1). Redundancy for a
given ribosomal protein gene in a given species was often
low, and many gene sequences were represented by one or
a few EST sequences only. It should be mentioned that
due to this rather low sequence coverage the dataset is
most probably not free from sequencing errors. Furthermore, none of the 48 ribosomal proteins that were
included in the dataset were observed in all of the 36 spe-

cies investigated (Table 1 and Additional file 1). In summary, for each ribosomal protein gene information was
available for 25% to 86% of the taxa.
We calculated "similarity" values between the amino acid
sequences of F. candida and three well-represented species
(C. elegans (most-distant outgroup), Daphnia magna and
A. mellifera). These values were mapped onto a ternary
graph (Figure 1). Almost all points cluster in the lower
region of the ternary graph, showing that for almost all
genes the distance between F. candida and C. elegans is
greater than the distance between F. candida and A. mellifera. The graph also shows that most genes of F. candida are
more "similar" to A. mellifera, while some have more in
common with D. magna.
The individual alignments were concatenated and phylogenetic analyses were conducted to investigate the position of Collembola. Two species were excluded from the
analyses (Table 1). The final alignment had a length of
5034 inferred amino acids, representing in total 15,102
nucleotides. Information was available for 66% of the
amino acid positions.
Likelihood mapping was applied to obtain estimates of
phylogenetic signal. The concatenated dataset contained
more phylogenetic signal (89% fully resolved quartets)

C. elegans

than each of the independent ribosomal protein alignments (9–72% fully resolved quartets; data not shown).
The trees obtained by the different tree-reconstruction
algorithms were highly comparable (Figure 2). In all
reconstructions (MP, ML and Bayesian), Chelicerata and
Pancrustacea each formed a monophyletic group, with
relatively high support (Bayesian posterior probabilities
both 100%). The two branchiopods included in this study
(D. magna and Artemia franciscana) grouped together, and
remained separate from the other crustaceans (Malacostraca).
The relationships within the Insecta were weakly resolved;
however, Diptera was recovered as a monophyletic clade,
as were Lepidoptera and Coleoptera (Figure 2). However,
the Hemiptera were resolved as a paraphyletic group.
Homalodisca coagulata grouped with Locusta migratoria
(Orthoptera), rather than with the other hemipterans
Acyrthosypon pisum and Toxoptera citricida. The highly supported, but obviously incorrect, positioning of Homalodisca coagulata does not seem to be an artefact of the
method that allowed for missing data, since all three
Hemiptera, as well as Locusta migratoria, were represented
by a large number of ribosomal protein gene sequences
(32 to 47). The incorrect placement of H. coagulata could
be a consequence of the inability of ribosomal protein
genes to resolve more recent evolutionary splits, which
may be a trade-off of their suitability for deeper phylogenies.
Hexapoda was clearly monophyletic: Both collembolans
(F. candida and O. cincta) grouped together and formed
the sister-group to the Insecta in all analyses conducted
(ML bootstrap RtRev+G+F = 91%, ML bootstrap
Wag+G+F = 86%, MP bootstrap = 78%, Bayesian posterior
probabilities = 100%).

mapped on this graph, as analysis of our RpS30 alignment
resulted in a Kimura protein distance that was larger than
one: Kimura protein distance C. elegans and F. candida = 1.14.

Several C. elegans and D. melanogaster ribosomal proteins
are duplicated (see also RPG database). MP analyses of a
second concatenated dataset that contained D. melanogaster homologs for ribosomal protein RpS5, RpS15A,
RpS19, RpS28, RpL34 and RpL10A resulted in a similar
topology (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study we reassessed the position of Collembola,
using (partial) genes for 48 nuclear encoded proteins. The
main result of our study is clear evidence of monophyly of
Hexapoda. All phylogenetic reconstruction methods
employed in this study support this hypothesis (Figure 2).
Based on our nuclear dataset we conclude that the six-legged body plan, as found among insects and Collembola,
evolved only once in the course of evolution. This is in
contrast to results obtained using large mitochondrial

datasets [3,6,9,10] that by and large suggest that the characteristic hexapod body plan was acquired in parallel by
Collembola and insects due to convergent evolution,
rather than by descent.
Discrepancies between pancrustacean relationships as
revealed by either nuclear or mitochondrial datasets seem
almost universal. It is of major importance to focus on the
causes of these discrepancies, and whether or not one of
the two types of markers is superior. Elaborate discussions
on the 'pros and cons' of one or both of the two different
markers, and the possible approaches on how to correct
for ambiguous signals are given in several recent papers
[8,9,29-32]. Comparative studies that contrast nuclear
and mitochondrial datasets suggest that nuclear markers
are preferred in deep arthropodan molecular phylogenetics, as mitochondrial genes tend to be more substitutionally biased and evolve (in general) in a much faster way
[30].
Already in 1999 Curole and Kocher [33] stated in a review
paper that the value of mitochondrial genes in deep-level
phylogeny is debatable and that "controversial" mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) results should be verified with
nuclear encoded genes. This was also the final conclusion
of Springer and co-workers [34]. These authors compared
the usability of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded genes
in inferring deep-level mammalian phylogenies. The
authors report that nuclear encoded genes (exons) outperform mitochondrial markers in resolving deep splits.
Springer and co-workers suggest that the reason for this
dissimilarity in resolving-power might be found, among
others, in the rate of nucleotide substitution [34].
Still, although the nuclear protein-encoding sequences in
the study of Springer et al. [34] outperformed the mitochondrial genes, mtDNA-based studies are not necessarily
useless for deep phylogeny. They are only problematic if
mitochondrial genomes evolve at such a rate that saturation of substitutions makes actual phylogenetic signals
from deeper nodes hazy [35]. Otherwise, analyses using
appropriate models should still be able to retrieve a plausible tree [35]. In a recent study, Kjer and Honeycutt [35]
used an approach that included all data found in mitochondrial genomes (including for instance 3rd codon
positions, but excluding the control region). After applying a site-specific rate model, these authors retrieved a
phylogenetic tree of mammals that was in accordance
with recent nuclear DNA based phylogenies [35].
When investigating cheliceratan relationships Jones et al.
[36] arrived at a comparable conclusion. These authors
state that mtDNA can be applied in molecular phylogenetics, but only when an appropriate substitution model
(e.g. to correct for strand-bias) is used. These authors state

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/83

as a final remark that earlier mtDNA studies that focused
on deep-phylogenetic questions should be thoroughly reevaluated [36]. However, such models of mitochondrial
sequence evolution might first need to be developed
before Collembola can be placed with certainty in the
arthropod phylogenetic tree. As mentioned before, Carapelli and co-workers [10] investigated an innovative pancrustacean-model of mitochondrial protein change. This
model significantly aided the tree building, but did not
yield a monophyletic Hexapoda [10].
An advantage of ribosomal protein genes is that the
sequences of different species can be relatively easily
homologized due to their conserved nature. However,
there are also disadvantages. Although ribosomal protein
genes are distributed all over the genome, they definitely
do not evolve independently. Coevolving sites are known
to exist in ribosomal proteins [37]. For example, amino
acid residues that are near tRNA binding sites in the ribosome appear to evolve in a related manner [37].
It has to be mentioned that we included only two Collembola in our analyses. Preferably, more springtail species,
and maybe even more importantly, proturans and diplurans, should be included. Those latter basal hexapod
groups were excluded from the current analysis as they
lack available (EST) data. While earlier work suggests that
proturan and dipluran genes might be fairly divergent
from other arthropods [11], this and other papers (e.g.
[21,22]) suggest that it should be relatively easy to obtain
phylogenetically relevant sequence information on those
groups by EST sequencing.
Another intriguing result of this study is the non-monophyly of the crustaceans. The branchiopods D. magna and
A. franciscana clustered with the hexapods rather than
with the other crustaceans in the malacostracan group.
This is in accordance with studies by Regier and co-workers [5] and Mallat and Giribet [12], which suggests that
the hexapod lineage evolved from within the crustaceans
[38]. The observed close relationship between hexapods
and branchiopods, in combination with some other characteristics, made Glenner and co-workers [38] suggest that
branchiopod groups colonized terrestrial ecosystems as
insects.
As a final remark we would like to point out that this study
shows that Collembola occupy a crucial position. Obtaining additional (EST) sequence information on Collembola, as well as other basal hexapods (Protura, Diplura
and Microcoryphia) will definitely result in a better
understanding of the phylogenetic origin of insects.

Conclusion
The phylogenetic efforts presented here clearly show that
Collembola is a sister group of Insecta (Figure 2). Our
results reinforce the discrepancy between results obtained
using mitochondrial and nuclear datasets. It seems of
major importance to unravel the underlying causes of the
disagreements observed, or otherwise focus on nuclear
encoded genes.

Methods
EST dataset and ribosomal protein selection
Recently, approximately 9.000 F. candida EST sequences
were generated (see [23] for additional information). In
order to select springtail ribosomal protein gene
sequences from this EST dataset ribosomal protein cDNA
sequences of Drosophila melanogaster were retrieved from
the Ribosomal Protein Gene database (RPG [28]). These
sequences were then compared with the F. candida EST
dataset using TBlastX [39]. Springtail sequences showing
significant similarity (E value < 10-10) were used for further analysis. All F. candida sequences are stored in dbEST.
Sequence retrieval and DNA alignment
For this study 35 additional species, comprising nineteen
hexapod species, nine crustacean species, five chelicerates,
and two non-arthropod ecdysozoans (one nematode, and
one tardigrade) were selected (Table 1). For 31 species all
available nucleotide sequences were retrieved from NCBI
Genbank (including ESTs) using a Perl script, BioPerl [40]
and NCBI Entrez Programming Utilities [41]. Species-specific BLAST databases were constructed. The F. candida
ribosomal protein gene sequences, obtained as described
above, were compared to these databases using TBlastX
(minimal E value < 10-10). For every species, the sequences
showing significant resemblance to a specific ribosomal
protein were retrieved using Perl and BioPerl [40] and
grouped in a FASTA file (with a maximum of 24 sequences
per ribosomal protein per species). Additional file 2
shows all GenBank accessions that were used. The software program Phrap (P. Green, pers. comm. [42]) was
applied to assemble a "consensus" sequence for each of
these FASTA files: Phrap combines all available sequences
and takes sequence coverage into account, which results
in more precise consensus sequences. When Phrap created
more than one sequence for a given ribosomal protein
gene in a given species, the sequence part that was most
abundant in the original sequence dataset was used for
further analysis. All obtained nucleotide sequences were
automatically translated to high quality peptides using the
software program prot4EST [43].

The 48 ribosomal sequences were in addition compared
to three smaller and unpublished collembolan (Orchesella
cincta) EST datasets. These O. cincta ESTs were generated
from libraries constructed by Roelofs and co-workers [44],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/83

Ellers and co-workers [45] and T.K.S Janssens. Finally, D.
melanogaster, C. elegans and Apis mellifera protein
sequences were obtained from RPG as well.
For each ribosomal protein gene, the protein or the
prot4EST inferred amino-acid sequences of the different
species were aligned using ClustalW [46] and inspected
with GeneDoc [47]. If for a certain species a ribosomal
protein was represented by more than one locus in the
RPG database, one ribosomal protein was randomly
taken. Additional alignments were made in which the
chosen D. melanogaster sequences were replaced by their
homologous counterparts. This was done for RpS5,
RpS15A, RpS19, RpS28, RpL34 and RpL10A. Sequences
that aligned poorly were subjected to visual inspection,
and those sequences that appeared to be out of frame
from an identifiable amino-acid position were manually
corrected and re-aligned. This implied that insertions and
deletions causing frame-shifts were characterized as missing or were removed. All alignments were trimmed to the
length of the F. candida sequence. Finally, inadequately
aligned regions were excluded from further analysis using
the program Gblocks [48].
Phylogenetic analysis
First, to obtain insight into the information contained by
each of the 48 inferred ribosomal protein sequences, the
distances (Kimura's distance [49]) between F. candida and
three well-represented species (C. elegans (outgroup), D.
magna (Crustacea) and A. mellifera (Insecta)) were calculated using the PHYLIP package Protdist [50]. Those values were used to calculate "similarity" values by
subtracting the distance value from one (similarity = 1 distance). Similarities were visualized in a ternary graph in
Microsoft Excel, using TernPlot [51]. All the individual
alignments were additionally subjected to a likelihood
mapping analysis using Tree-Puzzle [52,53] (max. 10.000
quartets, WAG model [54] of substitution) in order to
assess the phylogenetic signal in the dataset.

Second, all the individual alignments were concatenated
into a single alignment. If due to the presence of paralogous D. melanogaster sequences two alignments were
available for one ribosomal protein, only one was
included. This procedure resulted in a dataset with spaces
of missing data (sensu [20]). The alignment is available
from [55]. To check if the final outcome depended critically on the choice for one or the other paralog, a second
concatenated alignment was made in which each D. melanogaster homolog was replaced by its counterpart (for
RpS5, RpS15A, RpS19, RpS28, RpL34 and RpL10A).
The first concatenated dataset was analyzed with TreePuzzle [52] as described above. Subsequently, this alignment was analyzed with Maximum Parsimony (MP),

Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. ML
analyses (100 bootstrap replicates) were conducted using
the Linux version of Phyml v2.4.4 [56], applying substitution models that were selected with ModelGenerator
(gamma distribution with four rate categories)[57]. The
selected model for the translated dataset was RtREV+G+F
[58]. The ML analysis of the inferred amino acid dataset
was repeated using the WAG+G+F substitution model;
this model is appropriate for soluble proteins like ribosomal proteins [21], and provided the third-best data fit
after the RtREV+G+F and the RtREV+I+G+F models. Bayesian analysis (RtREV+G+F) was conducted using the Windows version of MrBayes [59]. Analyses were run for
1,000,000 generations (MCMC sampling without heating, "one chain" and tree-sampling every 100 generations). The log likelihood values for the different
generations were used to determine stationarity by plotting them, and the first 50,000 generations were discarded
as "burn-in".

partly financed through funding from a Bsik Research grant (BSIK03011)
from the Netherlands Genomics Initiative.

References
The ML and Bayesian analysis used the same model of
sequence evolution for all the concatenated genes. However, likelihood methods restricted to only one model
might perform inadequately when analyzing concatenated datasets [60]. Therefore, the data was analyzed
using Maximum Parsimony, which might address this
problem. The MP analysis was performed in the software
MEGA [61] under Windows using all available sites
(1,000 bootstrap analyses; Starting tree obtained by Random Addition). The second concatenated dataset, which
contained the homologous counterparts of duplicated D.
melanogaster ribosomal proteins was analyzed using MP
only.

Bootstrap values above 70% (ML and MP) or 95% (Bayesian) were deemed significant.
