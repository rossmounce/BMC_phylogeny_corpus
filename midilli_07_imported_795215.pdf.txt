Abstract
We described a series of imported cases of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in
Istanbul and investigated the genetic diversity of the virus. All the suspected cases of CCHF, who
were applied to the health centers in Istanbul, were screened for CCHF virus (CCHFv) infection
by using semi-nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) following RT-PCR. Simultaneous blood
samples were also sent to the national reference laboratory in Ankara for serologic investigation.
In 10 out of 91 patients, CCHFv was detected by PCR, and among 9 out of 10, anti-CCHFv IgM
antibodies were also positive. Clinical features were characterized by fever, myalgia, and
hemorrhage. The levels of liver enzymes, creatinine phosphokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase
were elevated, and bleeding markers were prolonged. All the cases were treated with ribavirin.
There was no fatal case. All the strains clustered within the same group as other Europe/Turkey
isolates.

Background
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a fatal viral
infection described in about 30 countries over the world.
It has the most extensive geographic range among the
medically significant tick-borne viruses [1]. The occurrence of CCHF closely approximates the known world distribution of Hyalomma spp. ticks. The virus belongs to the
genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family and causes
severe diseases in humans, with a reported case fatality
rate of 3–30% [1]. CCHF outbreak in Turkey was reported
in 2003 [2-4]. By the year 2006, 1103 CCHF confirmed
patients were recorded at the Ministry of Health (MOH)
of Turkey [5]. The diagnoses of these cases were per-

formed by detection of the virus by PCR or IgM and/or
IgG positivity by ELISA. All these patients were hospitalized, 59 of them died, and the case fatality rate was calculated as 5.3%. A great majority of the cases were seen in
the eastern Anatolia. No local case was reported from
Istanbul yet. However, cases were recently observed in
other regions of the country, and the rate of the domestic
travel and mobility is high in the country.
Humans become infected through the bites of ticks, by
contact with a patient with CCHF during the acute phase
of infection, or by contact with blood or tissues from
viremic livestock [6]. In 1969, the antigenic structures of

the viruses from various geographic regions were reported
to be indistinguishable [7]. However, the development of
nucleic acid sequence analysis revealed extensive genetic
diversity. Furthermore, more data on the genetic sub-types
of the viral strains could shed light on the transmission
dynamics of the virus. In this study we describe the genetic
variation and clinical characteristics of the CCHF cases
observed in Istanbul, in the western part of the country.

Methods
The Management of the cases
Istanbul unit of the MOH established an ad hoc committee
for the management of a potential CCHF infection in the
city. The group defined the organizational flow for the
management of the suspected cases. The suspected cases
were defined as the cases with symptoms or signs of CCHF
such as fever, myalgia, malaise, and bleeding, and also the
history of travel to the endemic region or tick bite. The
patients with acute febrile syndrome characterized by
malaise, bleeding, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia in
the summer months of 2006 were admitted to the various
hospitals of Istanbul (Figure 1).

The patients who had positive IgM and/or IgG and/or positive PCR results for CCHFV in blood were included to the
study. The IgM and IgG positivity was detected by using
ELISA [8]. Serology for Lyme disease, Salmonella, Leptospira, Rickettsiae, Brucella, and Coxiella infections were
investigated. STATA 9.0 (USA) software package was used
in the analysis.

laboratory. Upon receipt RNA was extracted from 200 μl
whole blood using a commercial RNA extraction kit (High
Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit, Roche Diagnostics®, Germany). The extracted RNA and remaining blood were
aliquoted and stored at -80°C until work-up. At the
admission and the release of the patients blood samples
were also sent to the national reference laboratory for
serological investigation. Omniscript reverse transcription
kit (Qiagen®, Germany) was used for the cDNA synthesis
in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.
Primers from S segment of the virus were selected for the
first and second round amplifications. For this purpose, S
segment sequences from different geographic regions.

were downloaded from the GeneBank and aligned using
Clustal Wallis [9] software program. The sites of the possible primers were selected visually and evaluated using
Primer test option of Primer Express software (Applied
Biosystems®, USA).
Five forward and 2 reverse primers were designed initially.
Based on the results of the optimization and assesment of
the performance of the primers performed using CCHF
virus cDNA and PCR optimization kit (Sigma®, Germany)
with different Mg++ and primer concentrations, two forward and one reverse primer were selected for routine use.
All but one of the remaining primers were used as
sequencing primers. The sequences of the primers numbered based on the sequence of Hodza strain (AY223475)
(Table 1).
Five μl reverse transcription product was added to the 45
μl reaction mixture consisted of 1 μl forward primer (50
pmol/μl)) and 1 μl reverse primer (50 pmol/μl), 5 μl 10×
reaction buffer, 3 μl 25 mM MgCl2, 1 μl dNTP stock (200
mM each dATP, dTTP, dCTP and dGTP) (Fermentas®,
Lithuania), 0.25 μl Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas®,
Lithuania) and 33.75 μl nuclease free water. Amplification was carried out on a gradient thermal cycler under
following conditions: After initial denaturation for 3 minutes at 94°C; 45 cycles of 1 minute at 94°C, 1 minute at
52°C and 3 minutes at 72°C. Final extention was performed at 72°C for 10 minutes. For the second round
amplification 2 μl first round products was added to the
48 μl reaction mixture with the same concentrations of

The second round PCR products were cleaned up with a
commercial PCR product purification kit (High Pure PCR
Product Purification Kit, Roche Diagnostics®, Germany
and the purified products were subjected to the cyclesequencing using big-dye terminator kit (ABI®, USA). The
excess primers and nucleotides were removed from cyclesequencing products using sephadex-G50 fine columns,
and the products were run on an automated sequencer
(ABI®, 310).

The obtained sequences were edited and aligned using
lasergene (DNA Star®) and Bioedit software packages [10].
The sequences belonging to five patients were deposited
to the GeneBank under the accession numbers:
DQ983741, DQ983742, DQ983743, DQ983744,
DQ983745. For molecular analyses and comparisons, a
portion spanning 593 (between 146–739. nucleotides;
numbering according to Hodza strain, AY223475)
nucleotides of the S segment was used. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out by distance method using neighbor
joining algorithm with Treecon, version 1.3b software
[11]. Distances were calculated under Kimura 2 parameter
model. Transition/transversion ratio was estimated from
the data. Neither insertions nor deletions were taken in to

Sequence analyses
Although the patients came from different localities of
Turkey or had indirect contact with different endemic
areas, the sequences of CCHFv were closely related. The
nucleotide variation ranged between 0.66% and 3%, and
this variation did not result in any amino acid substitution. In comparisons with the representative strains from
different geographic regions, the strains detected in Istanbul showed highest homologies with Eastern European
strains. Nucleotide and amino acid diversities varied
between
1.16%–3.17%
and
0–1
respectively
(DQ1335071, DQ211643). Higher nucleotide and
amino acid divergencies (21.20% and 20% respectively)
were observed in comparisons with representative strains
from Asian (AJ538196, M86625, DQ446212), and African (U88411, U88410, DQ076413) clades, and the Greek
isolate (U04958). A total of 41 sequences of CCHFv S segment were used for the construction of the phylogenetic
tree. In this tree the strains clustered with high bootstrap
values reaching up to 100% in 6 clusters reflecting their
different origins as shown previously. Our strains clustered in the Europe/Turkey clade [12] (Figure 3).

Discussion
Since CCHF was endemic for the last four years in Eastern
Anatolia, the ad hoc committee for CCHF in Istanbul initiated series of activities including the management of the
suspected cases, in a city with the population of over 10
millions. A public awareness campaign was launched
which included brochures, TV programs, and public
health worker education programs about early diagnosis
and preventive measures concerning tick bites and CCHF
infections. As a result, there is improved surveillance and
diagnosis of suspected cases (Figure 1). It is possible that
previous introductions have gone unnoticed, especially
since the majority of the cases appear to be relatively mild.
Suspected CCHF infections in people traveling from
endemic regions to disease-free areas, such as Istanbul,
were confirmed in 10 out of 91 cases. Nine out of 10 cases
were from Eastern Anatolian provinces, where cases were
reported previously [2,3,13]. However, one case originated from Kirklareli near the border with Bulgaria, which
is the first report from this area (Figure 2). Imported cases
of CCHF were reported previously, as cases from people
traveling from one country to another [14,15].
Sixty percent of our patients reported the tick bite, and all
the patiens had been bitten out of Istanbul (Table 2). The
HCWs facing with the suspected cases should be aware
that, a significant proportion of the suspected cases did
not report tick bite, as it was previously published [1]. In
South Africa, the time to onset of disease after exposure to
tick bite was 3.2 days, to blood or tissue of livestock was 5
days, and to blood of human cases was 5.6 days [16]. The
mean duration of the disease course before the hospital
was reported to be 5.5 days in a previous study from Turkey [2]. However in our study, the average time from
onset of disease to admission to hospital was 7 days
(Table 2). None of the cases was fatal. The patients were
given erythrocyte, fresh frozen plasma, and total blood
preparations depending on their hemostasis. All the
patients were given ribavirin therapy before the virologic
evidence of CCHF infection.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/54

Also, CCHF is endemic in neighboring countries and
genetically distant strains circulate in Bulgaria, Iran and
Greece [17-19]. Moreover, in Iran, two different lineages
of the virus have been reported; one belonging to the
Asian-Middle Eastern clade and the other to the African
clades [18]. Strains reported from Iraq and Arabian countries were closely related to those reported from Iran. Nevertheless, strains from the Eastern European countries and
South-western Russia form a distinct group with relatively
low heterogeneity (Figure 3).
Although relatively few sequences are available since the
disease outbreaks were recorded in Turkey for the first
time in 2003, those which are available are related to viral
lineages found in Kosovo and South-western Russia [3].
Furthermore, viral strains in ticks collected from the
endemic region where the first outbreaks occurred, were
also found to be closely related with the Europe/Turkey
strains [20,21]. In our study, all strains clustered within
the same group with the Europe/Turkey isolates, despite
they originated from eight different geographic areas, 7
previously known and one focus on the European part of
the Turkey, which was identified in this study (Figure 3).
Interestingly one strain (SPU 9/00/5) from Iran reported
by Burt and Swaenopel [22] clustered also with Europe/
Turkey clade.
Despite more viral strains are needed to draw any definite
conclusion, it appears the emergence of CCHF in Turkey
may be the result of an amplification of local viral isolates
by wildlife populations rather than resulting from novel
introductions from neighbouring countries. Continued
surveillance to monitor suspected CCHF cases, not only
within known foci, but also outside endemic areas as
reported herein, is required.

Authors' contributions
All authors read and approved the final manuscript

Although the genetic heterogeneity of tick-borne RNA
viruses is generally low, CCHFv shows a high level of
genetic heterogeneity up to 22% nucleotide variations
and 27% amino acid variations based on the S fragment,
which is reflected into six genetically distinct clades [12].
Although confirmed patients came from 8 different localities in Turkey, all CCHFv sequences were closely related.
The nucleotide variation ranged between 0.66% and 3%,
and this variation did not result in any amino acid substitution. In comparison with representative strains from different geographic regions, those strains found in this
study displayed the highest homology with the Eastern
European and some Russian isolates (clade V)(Fig. 3).
