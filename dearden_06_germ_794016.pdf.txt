Abstract
Background: Studies of specification of germ-cells in insect embryos has indicated that in many
taxa the germ cells form early in development, and their formation is associated with pole plasm,
germ plasm or an organelle called the oosome. None of these morphological features associated
with germ cell formation have been identified in the Honeybee Apis mellifera. In this study I report
the cloning and expression analysis of Honeybee homologues of vasa and nanos, germ cell markers
in insects and other animals.
Results: Apis vasa and nanos RNAs are present in early honeybee embryos, but the RNAs clear
rapidly, without any cells expressing these germ cell markers past stage 2. These genes are then
only expressed in a line of cells in the abdomen from stage 9 onwards. These cells are the
developing germ cells that are moved dorsally by dorsal closure and are placed in the genital ridge.
Conclusion: This study of the expression of germ cell markers in the honeybee implies that in this
species either germ cells are formed by an inductive event, late in embryogenesis, or they are
formed early in development in the absence of vasa and nanos expression. This contrasts with germ
cell development in other members of the Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera.

Background
The formation and placement of primordial germ cells
(PGCs) in animal embryos is of interest in developmental
biology, evolutionary biology and biotechnology. In Diptera, including the well studied Drosophila melanogaster,
PGCs form as morphologically and molecularly distinct
pole cells, in the posterior of the embryo, early in development [1,2]. In insects outside the Diptera PGCs can
develop in regions of pole or germ plasm, a distinct form
of cytoplasm in early eggs [3], or are associated with the
oosome [4-6] a specialised subcellular structure that
appears to define PGC fate early in embryogenesis. These
specialised structures and/or cytoplasm are widely distrib-

uted amongst insects but are not found in all insect
embryos [1,7].
In the honeybee (Apis mellifera), little is known about the
formation of PGCs in the embryo. In late embryonic and
larval stages PGCs have been identified in the genital ridge
situated near the dorsal surface of the abdomen where the
gonads develop [8]. Previous authors have stated that
there is no evidence for PGCs arising early in development
[8] as is seen in other insects.
In other insects PGC placement and development has
been studied using molecular markers of germ cell fate

[7,9,10]. Two genes, vasa and nanos, have proved useful
markers for PGCs in a broad range of species.
The vasa gene encodes a DEAD box RNA helicase that is
expressed in the PGCs of all major groups of animals
examined [11-17]. In mice, vasa related genes are
expressed in PGCs and are required for PGC development
[18]. In Drosophila vasa is required for multiple processes
in the development and maintenance of PGCs (reviewed
in [19]) including the localisation of nanos RNA [20].

Nanos genes encode zinc finger transcription factors that
have been shown to be expressed in the PGCs of Diptera
[21-23], Caenorhabditis elegans [24], Cnidarians [25,26],
Leech [27,28], mice [29] and humans [30]. In Drosophila
nanos is required for PGC migration and fate [21] and acts
to repress somatic cell fate in PGCs by repressing differentiation [31,32]. In Zebrafish, nanos is required for PGC
migration and survival [33]. Mice have three nanos-like
genes, two of which are expressed in PGCs and required
for their maintenance [29].

Vasa expression, assayed with in-situ hybridisation or
antibodies, has been used most generally as a PGCs
marker in arthropod embryos. Using both techniques,
PGC specification has been studied in the orthopteran
Schistocerca gregaria. In this species PGCs form at the dorsal boundaries of the germband in the abdomen and
migrate dorsally to the gonads [7]. Vasa expression has
also been examined in the lepidopteran Bombyx mori [9].
In this species, vasa RNA is first expressed in the presumptive embryo and then comes to be located in cells at the
posterior of the germ band. In later stages these vasa positive cells populate the abdomen in regions consistent
with the forming gonads. In non insect arthropods, vasa
expression has also been examined in the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) [11], and the crustaceans
Daphnia [12] and Parhayle [13]. In Tetranychus, vasa RNA
marks a population of cells underlying the cellular blastoderm that migrate into the posterior of the embryo and

are incorporated into the gonad. In Daphnia, vasa protein
is localised in a subcellular compartment in 8 cell stage
embryos and is partitioned into a single blastomere at the
16-cell stage. This vasa positive cell is the progenitor for
the germ line in this species [12]. In Parhayle, vasa protein
expression becomes apparent at the 8-cell stage in the gmicromere. Manipulation of the embryo, however, indicates that localised determinants for PGC development
exist at the 2 cell stage [13].
In Hymenoptera, the insect order containing the honeybee, vasa expression has been examined only in the polyembryonic parasitic wasp Copidosoma floridanum. In this
species, an organelle, the oosome, stains for vasa RNA and
is segregated into cells that then express vasa RNA and protein and form PGCs. Inheritance of PGCs appears to regulate both larval caste and axis formation [10,34].
Oosomes that specify germ-cell fate are found in many

experimental lanes but without the addition of reverse transcriptase in the first stand synthesis. This controls for genomic
DNA contamination of the cDNA. These lanes are labelled with -RT. RT-PCR was also attempted from ten times more cDNA
from stages 3–7 in an attempt to detect low level expression (10 × 3–7) Successful amplification of Amvasa gives a 916 bp fragment. Amplification is seen only in cDNA from just laid embryos and stages 10 and above.

hymenopteran species [4,6] but are not present in Honeybee ovaries or embryos [35].
Nanos genes have a role in specifying posterior regions of
insect embryos [22,23,36-38]. In Drosophila, nanos RNA is
localised to posterior regions of the embryo, and nanos
translation is repressed in the rest of the embryo by the
binding of smaug protein to a RNA secondary structure in
the 3'UTR of the nanos mRNA [39]. Nanos protein then
regulates Hunchback (Hb) translation by recruiting a
cofactor, pumilio, that binds a 'nanos response element'
in the 3'UTR of the Hunchback mRNA, thus restricting Hb
protein expression to the anterior of the embryo [37]. This
translation repression activity in the posterior of insect
embryos appears to be conserved in the orthopteran Schistocerca americana [36] where nanos RNA is also posteriorly
localised. Posteriorly localised nanos expression is also
found in mosquito embryos [22].
In this paper I have cloned cDNA fragments of Honeybee
vasa and nanos and used in-situ hybridisation on embryos
and ovaries to determine if honeybee PGCs are specified
early in development, like many holometabolous insect
embryos, or if they form late in development from an
inductive event.

Results
Identification of homologues of nanos and vasa in
honeybees
Reciprocal blast searches [40] of the honeybee and Drosophila melanogaster genomes with Drosophila vasa and
nanos sequences identified a single region of the honeybee
genome with homology to vasa, and a single region with
homology to nanos. Gene predictions corresponding to
each of these regions were collected and analysed.

protein. To ensure that the gene identified is the orthologue of vasa from the Honeybee, the Honeybee genome
was searched for regions encoding DEAD box helicase
proteins. All of the DEAD-box encoding regions have
been identified in the GLEAN3 official gene prediction
set. Neighbour joining phylogenetic analysis of a multiple
alignment of the predicted proteins encoded by these
sequences and other insect and vertebrate DEAD-box helicase proteins indicates that the Amvasa gene is the closest
homologue of vasa in the Honeybee genome (Figure 1B)
The sequence with highest homology to Drosophila nanos
in the Honeybee genome is included in a predicted transcript (GB14366-PA) that is annotated as similar to
venom protein Vn50 (Located on group 8.7). Analysis of
this transcript indicates that homology to nanos is
restricted to two upstream exons almost 7 KB from the
exons of the predicted transcript with homology to venom
protein Vn50 (Figure 2A). Just downstream of the second
exon corresponding to nanos is a gap in the genome
sequence that may have caused an error with the gene prediction software. I have sequenced across this gap and
identified an in-frame stop codon downstream of the second exon. Primers designed to amplify full-length nanos
from cDNA indicate that the gene prediction is correct in
this area. I designate the gene from which this sequence
derives Amnos. This sequence is deposited in Genbank as
DQ288392.

A predicted transcript (GB14804-PA, DQ288391) located
on group 1.64 has high homology to Drosophila vasa. I
term this transcript Amvasa. The transcript is predicted to
encode a protein containing all of the 8 domains conserved in DEAD box helicases. The GIVGXA motif, conserved in insect vasas, is also conserved but the EXRKF
domain conserved among Vasa and PL10 proteins is not
present. The function of this motif is not known. The full
length of this transcript was cloned from cDNA.

Multiple alignments of predicted proteins from nanos relatives indicate that the highest similarity between these
sequences lies in the C-terminal zinc-finger DNA binding
domain (Figure 2B). This region contains the two CCHC
motifs for coordinating the zinc atoms that are completely
conserved in Amnos. Outside of this region, sequence similarity is limited to short sequences. Phylogenetic analysis
of a multiple alignment of this conserved DNA binding
domain (Figure 2C) clusters the predicted Amnos protein
sequence with a predicted nanos gene from Nasonia, and
Drosophila nanos. Other insect nanos sequences (Schistocerca, Aedes and Anopheles, form a separate clade with
mouse nanos 2 and 3 and Danio nanos. Mouse nanos1
and human nanos 1 sequences cluster with the Drosophila
sequence and cnidarian nanos sequences form a separate
cluster.

Phylogenetic analysis of the Amvasa predicted protein
sequence indicates that it clusters with Drosophila, Bombyx
and Schistocerca vasa proteins as well as a predicted vasalike
dead
box
helicase
from
Anopheles
(ENSANGP00000013029) (Figure 1A). Related non-vasa
DEAD-box helicases form a separate clade in this analysis,
indicating that the Amvasa is a homologue of Drosophila
vasa and not a related DEAD-box helicase. The lack of the
vasa specific EXRKF motif is unusual for an insect vasa

In Drosophila the 3'UTR of nanos contains a structural RNA
motif required for translational repression [39,41], no
sequence homology to this region can be seen in the
Amnos 3'UTR. An RNA structure prediction program
(MFOLD[42]) predicts the first 130 bases of the Amnos
3'UTR produces a similar RNA fold to that of the Drosophila 3'UTR (Figure 2A ii and iii). The Drosophila motif
contains sequences similar to bearded boxes that are also
associated with translation repression [43]. Predicted

bearded boxes are present downstream of the Amnos gene
but not in the predicted secondary structure.
Expression of Amvasa in honeybee embryos
In-situ hybridisation using a fragment of the Amvasa
cDNA sequence was used to determine the placement and
development of PGCs in female honeybee embryo (Figure
3). The probe was made from a 631 bp fragment of
Amvasa from the second exon, a relatively non-conserved
region of the gene. The C terminal part of the protein
encoded by this fragment is boxed in Figure 1. Amvasa
RNA is present at early stages of Apis embryogenesis, with
a uniform distribution at stage 1 (Staging as per [35]) (Figure 3A and 3B). This initial expression rapidly disappears
by late stage 1. Amvasa in not expressed in any cells until
stage 9, when Amvasa RNA appears in a line of cells start-

ing in the 3rd abdominal segment (A3) and stretching to
the 6th abdominal segment (A6) (Figure 3G and 3N). This
line of cells lies just ventral to the boundary between the
germband and the extra-embryonic membranes and lies
just underneath the epidermis of the embryo. These cells
continue to express Amvasa through the rest of embryogenesis (Figure 3I and 3K), and, in larval honeybees, come
to be placed in regions consistent with the placement of
the genital ridge (Figure 3L).
Amvasa RNA is also detected in a small group of cells in
the mandibular segment in stage 9 embryos (Asterisks in
figure 3G and 3I and arrow in Figure 3O). It is unclear
what this structure is.

Expression of Amvasa in Honeybee ovaries

Expression of Amvasa in Honeybee ovaries. Scale bars represent 100 micrometers. A) The full length of a mated queen
ovariole stained for Amvasa RNA. Amvasa RNA is present in both nurse cells and oocytes but not follicle cells. Staining is absent
from the oldest oocytes, an artefact caused by problems getting labelled probes into these oocytes. All other oocytes have uniform staining of Amvasa RNA except those in the germarium and terminal filament where Amvasa RNA is absent. Amvasa RNA
is also present in the nurse cells. In the early vitellarium, the nurse cells closest to the oocyte express lower levels of Amvasa
RNA (arrows), but this difference in expression is not seen in the late vitellarium. Amvasa RNA levels are reduced in the last
set of nurse cells, which are degrading prior to fertilisation and oviposition of the egg. B) Amvasa RNA expression in the vitellarium and germarium of a worker bee ovary. In the vitellarium, Amvasa RNA is expressed in the nurse cells and oocyte. In the
germarium, Amvasa RNA is restricted to the oocytes themselves, except for the last oocyte/ nurse cell group, where Amvasa is
expressed in some of the nurse cells. C) Magnification of the germarium shown in B under DIC optics showing Amvasa expression in germ-cells and in the last group of nurse cells (arrowed) D) The tip of the germarium and the terminal filament of a

and F) Magnification of the beginning of the terminal filaments of a worker bee ovary stained for Amvasa RNA and using the
nuclear dye DAPI under brightfield (E) and fluorescence (F) optics. Amvasa RNA is seen in a subset of cells in this region. The

stained for Amvasa, and using the nuclear dye DAPI under brightfield (G) and fluorescence (H) optics. Cells expressing Amvasa
can be seen surrounded by non-staining cells. Amvasa expression quenches the nuclear signal in these images, so bright spots of
DAPI fluorescence indicate unstained nuclei.

The expression of Amvasa RNA seems to indicate that
PGCs in Apis form late in embryogenesis. It is possible,
however, that the distribution of the Amvasa RNA does
not reflect the distribution of Amvasa protein, as in Drosophila [44]. To determine if Amvasa protein is present in
embryos stages 2–8, embryos were stained using an antibody raised against Schistocerca gregaria vasa that has been
shown to cross react in a number of species [7,13,25]. No
staining above background in Apis embryos or ovaries was

detected using the antibody in conditions in which Drosophila melanogaster embryos did stain in the canonical
vasa pattern, implying this antibody does not cross-react
with Amvasa (data not shown).
To confirm the timing of Amvasa RNA expression, RT-PCR
was carried out on RNA from honeybee embryos of various stages (Figure 3P). A PCR product of the target length,
consistent with Amvasa RNA, was found only in RNA from

Amnos RNA is present in a localised domain in the posterior regions of the oocyte, with a 'tail' of Amnos RNA spreading back
along one side of the oocyte towards the anterior. In the early vitellarium, Amnos RNA is localised in a domain in central
regions of each oocyte. Amnos is also expressed weakly in the nurse cells, particularly in those closest to the oocyte. B) DIC

earlier oocytes, expression appears uniform. The patch of Amnos RNA is not associated with the oocyte nucleus (asterisks).
No expression of Amnos is seen in the nurse cells. D) DIC image of an oocyte and nurse cells from the late vitellarium. Amnos
RNA is only present in a small posterior patch, not associated with the nucleus (asterisk). The nurse cells all express Amnos

expression is seen in the nurse cells of the vitellarium, with weaker expression in the oocyte. In the germarium, Amnos RNA is

just laid eggs and embryos over stage 10. No Amvasa RNA
could be detected in embryos of stages 3–7, consistent
with our in-situ hybridisation results.

Expression of Amnos in honeybee embryos
As Amvasa RNA expression indicated the late formation of
PGCs and I was unable to confirm this using the anti-vasa

antibody, the expression of Amnos was used as a second
PGC marker in female embryos. Amnos RNA is first
detected in stage 1 embryos where it is present in a gradient with highest expression in posterior regions of the
embryo (Figure 4A). This expression fades rapidly through
embryogenesis such that it is faint in stage 2 embryos (Figure 4C) and absent from stage 3 embryos. No further
expression of Amnos is seen in embryos until stage 9 (Figure 4I), when expression appears in a line of cells, starting
in the 3rd abdominal segment and stretching to the 6th
abdominal segment. Like the cells marked with Amvasa,
Amnos expressing cells lie under the epidermis and just
ventral to the boundary between the embryonic and
extraembryonic membranes. The distribution of Amnos
and Amvasa in these embryos is identical except for the
anterior patch of cells expressing Amvasa; these cells do
not express Amnos.
To confirm the timing of Amnos RNA expression, RT-PCR
was carried out on RNA from honeybee embryos of various stages (Figure 4K). A PCR product of the target length
(257 bp), consistent with Amnos RNA, was found only in
RNA from just-laid eggs and embryos over stage 10. These
data are consistent with our in-situ hybridisation results
in that Amnos RNA is not expressed between stages 3–7.
Expression of Amvasa in queen and worker bee ovaries
Apis mellifera have polytrophic meroistic ovaries, similar
to those of Drosophila melanogaster. Despite this similarity,
a number of differences in morphology and biology exist.
One particularly important difference is that worker bee
ovaries have many less ovarioles than those of queens
(Figure 5). Workers in a queenright colony have small
ovaries that are chemically repressed by the presence of
the queen and her eggs [45]. Removal of the queen from
a colony can cause the reactivation of the worker bee ovaries and the workers may lay eggs [45]. To see if germ cell
placement or organisation is significantly different in
workers compared to queen ovaries I used in-situ hybridisation for Amvasa RNA to examine the placement of germ
cells in both types of ovary (Figure 6).

In the queen ovary, both nurse and germ cells express
Amvasa. Amvasa RNA is not localised to any particular area
in either cell type. Amvasa RNA is present in oocytes in the
vitellarium, but expression is absent, or very weak in the
germarium and terminal filament. In the nurse cells, RNA
is present in all cells in the vitellarium, but in the germarium, the expression of Amvasa RNA is reduced in the nurse
cells closest to the oocytes (arrows in figure 6A). Expression of Amvasa RNA does not extend beyond the germarium in nurse cells. No expression of Amvasa is seen in
follicle cells.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/6

In worker ovaries a similar expression pattern can be seen
(Figure 6B). Amvasa RNA is present in all oocytes, but, in
contrast to queen ovaries, this expression extends into the
terminal filament (Figures 6D, E, F, G, and 6H). Expression of Amvasa RNA in the nurse cells is reduced in worker
ovaries. Expression can be seen in nurse cells in the vitellarium, and, faintly, in the nurse cells associated with the
last oocyte in the germarium (Figure 6C). In the terminal
filament (Figures 6D, E, F, G and 6H) Amvasa RNA expression marks germ cells in the entire structure. Comparison
of the expression of Amvasa RNA and the location of
nuclei stained with DAPI indicates that the germ cells in
the start of the terminal filament are surrounded by disc
shaped 'terminal filament cells' [46] that do not stain for
Amvasa. However within these compartments, cells that
do not express Amvasa are also present (Figure 6E and 6F).
It is not clear if these are nurse cells or follicle cells. In the
last sections of the terminal filament, cells positive for
Amvasa RNA are interspersed with cells that are not (Figure 6G and 6H). The expression of Amvasa in the worker,
but not queen terminal filament is a clear difference
between castes.
Expression of Amnos in queen and worker bee ovaries
The expression if Amnos RNA in queen and worker bee
ovaries was also examined using in-situ hybridisation
(Figure 7). In the early vitellarium and germarium, Amnos
RNA is present only in a discrete domain in the anterior
region of each oocyte, anterior to the oocyte nucleus
(Asterisks in figure 7C). In later vitellaria, Amnos RNA
staining is found faintly in the nurse cells, and in the localised domain in each oocyte. In later vitellaria, however,
this domain lies on one side of the oocyte and appears as
a patch in posterior regions of the egg with a more diffuse
'tail' stretching back to the more posterior regions. Neither
the patch nor the tail are associated with the oocyte
nucleus (asterisks in Figure 7B, C, D and 7E) and in all
cases lies posterior to it. In the oldest oocytes (Figure 7D)
Amnos RNA is found in an anterior patch that is fainter
that that in younger oocytes. I believe this faint staining is
an artefact caused by differential permeability of old and
young oocytes. The 'comet-like' form of the patch of localised Amnos RNA in later vitellaria is consistent with
movement of a discrete focus of Amnos RNA from anterior of the oocyte nucleus to posterior regions of the
oocyte.

In worker bee ovaries, by contrast, Amnos RNA is weakly
and uniformly distributed in oocytes in the vitellarium
and germarium (Figure 7G[47]) and, at higher levels, in
the nurse cells of the oldest oocyte. Amnos RNA is not
expressed in nurse cells, follicle cells or cells in the terminal filament.

Discussion
Identification of Apis homologues of nos and vasa
Blast searches and phylogenetic reconstruction indicate
that I have identified honeybee homologues of the evolutionarily conserved germ-cell markers nanos and vasa.

The Amvasa gene, also identified by [10], has all of the
conserved sequences indicative of a vasa protein, and clusters with other insect vasa sequences to the exclusion of
non vasa DEAD box helicases. The sequence does, however, have significant variation in the EXRKF motif, that is
conserved in PL10 and vasa helicases. The function of this
motif is unknown, thus the significance of its absence
from Amvasa is not known.
The Amnos gene identified in this study is similar in C-terminal regions to nanos proteins from other species. This
region contains the zinc coordination residues of the zinc
fingers. These residues are completely conserved in Amnos.
Drosophila nanos contains a sequence that forms a specific
secondary structure in the 3'UTR that is required for translational repression [41]. This secondary structure is bound
by the smaug protein in early embryos [39]. A similar secondary structure is predicted to form in the Amnos 3'UTR
though its function, if any, is unknown.
The conservation and phylogenetic placement of these
sequences is consistent with them encoding the conserved
germ-cell markers vasa and nos.
Germ cell development in Apis mellifera
Expression of Amnos and Amvasa RNA occurs in two
phases of honeybee embryonic development. Both genes
are expressed early in development, Amvasa in the entire
embryo, and Amnos in a gradient pattern with highest concentrations in the posterior of the embryo, both probably
due to maternal RNA contribution. These expression patterns disappear by stage 2. In later development, at and
after stage 9, both genes are expressed in a subset of cells
that lie close to the dorsal boundary of the embryo proper
and the extraembryonic membranes. These cells eventually come to be located in the dorsal-most regions of the
embryo consistent with the genital ridges and forming
gonads. That both genes are not expressed in embryos
between stage 2 and stage 9 implies that during these
stages there are no PGCs in the honeybee embryo, and
that these cells form via an inductive event at, or just
before, stage 9.

Neither morphological studies, nor the use of molecular
markers has found any evidence for pole-cells, pole plasm
or early segregating PGCs [8]. This is unlike the formation
of PGCs in Drosophila, which has a similar long-germ form
of embryo to that of Apis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/6

The expression of these two PGC markers implies that
germ-cells form very close to the boundary of the embryo
proper and the extra-embryonic membranes. The cells
form in A3-A6 and no sign of migration of the PGCs can
be seen. As dorsal closure occurs, the cells appear to be
moved, passively, to the dorsal surface of the larva, close
to the dorsal midline.
These findings indicate two possible scenarios for the origin of PGCs in the honeybee embryo. It is possible that
the appearance of PGC markers at a late stage of embryogenesis, similar to the situation in mice [48,49] implies
that an inductive event at stage 9 specifies PGCs. The
organisation of the cells, in a single line, is what might be
expected if the cells are being induced by a signal released
from an almost linear source. Just dorsal of the PGCs are
the extra-embryonic membranes that cover the dorsal
opening. It is possible that the putative inducing signal
leading to the formation of PGC fate emanates from the
extra-embryonic membranes.
It is also possible that the Amvasa and Amnos RNA are not
expressed in germ-cells that do form early in development, and only come to be expressed when these cells
reach the abdomen. Drosophila vasa RNA expression is
indeed absent from PGCs until stage 12 [44] and nanos
expression is down-regulated in Drosophila after stage 10
[38]. In the crustacean Parhayle PGCs are specified very
early in development, without the expression of vasa [13]
This study is unable to determine which of these two possible mechanisms underlies germ-cell formation in Honeybees.
Localisation of nos RNA and posterior development in
Apis mellifera
In Drosophila and other insects nanos acts to regulate posterior development [38]. Nos expression has been studied
in both Drosophila [38,41], other dipterans [22,23] and
Schistocerca [36]. In each studied species nos RNA is localised in posterior regions in early development. In Drosophila most nos RNA is localised very tightly to the
posterior, and its translation is repressed in anterior
regions [41]. In Drosophila nos acts as a key regulator of
posterior development, translationally repressing, in concert with pumilio, the anterior gene hunchback in the posterior [37,50]. In Schistocerca, the expression of nos is
coincident with a clearance of hunchback expression from
the very posterior regions of the embryo [36]. Hunchback
mRNA from Schistocerca is predicted to contain a nanos
response element, similar to that which is bound by Drosophila nanos to repress hunchback translation.

In Honeybees Amnos RNA is present in the posterior of the
early embryo (appearing in just laid eggs and clearing in

Page 11 of 14

BMC Developmental Biology 2006, 6:6

stage 2) This domain is broader that that in Drosophila
where the highest levels of nos RNA form, and appears to
represent a concentration gradient, with highest RNA
expression in the very posterior of the embryo. The Amnos
3'UTR does not contain an element with sequence similarity to the stem-loop structure in the 3'UTR of Drosophila
nos, but a similar RNA structure is predicted to be formed
by it.
In the ovary of queen bees, Amnos RNA expression is
found in a localised patch in oocytes, that appears to
move, during oocyte maturation, from anterior to posterior. In Schistocerca [36], and mosquitoes [22]nanos RNA
is also localised tightly to posterior regions of the oocyte.
The localisation of Amnos RNA in the oocyte is consistent
with a role in posterior patterning.

Gene identification and phylogenetics
Homologues of the Drosophila melanogaster vasa and nanos
genes were identified in the Honeybee genome sequence
(version 2) using tBlastN searches [40]. Regions of the
genome with significant blast hits were extracted and
blasted back to the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Gene
predictions from either NCBI (using gnomon) or
ENSEMBL were then examined in the regions with reciprocal top blast hits for vasa and nanos. Primers for amplification from cDNA were designed to the regions with the
highest homology.

Multiple alignments of the predicted Apis genes with
homologous genes from other species were carried out
using ClustalX [51]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed
on these multiple alignments using MrBayes 3.1 [52] or
Phylip [47]

Conclusion
I have used Amvasa and Amnos as molecular markers of
PGC fate in the honeybee Apis mellifera. The timing of
placement of their expression provides no evidence for
early specification of germ-cells but implies that honeybee
PGCs form from an inductive event late in embryonic
development. It is also possible that germ-cells form early
in the Honeybee embryo but do so in the absence of vasa
or nanos expression. Both these possibilities differ from
PGC specification in Drosophila, where morphologically
distinct PGCs appear early in development and are
marked by the expression of vasa and nanos, or the more
closely related Copidosoma, where a cellular organelle
determines PGC fate and contains vasa protein [5].
Any putative induction process implied by these results
appears similar to the segregation of PGCs in Schistocerca,
where early segregation is also not seen. The placement of
PGCs, forming close to the border between extra-embryonic and embryonic tissue and inside the epidermal layer,
seems similar in both species.
This mode of PGC formation indicates that the evolutionary history of PGC segregation in insects is not simple,
with different mechanisms acting in different species. It is
unclear, at this point, what the ancestral mechanism is,
and how the different mechanism of PGC specification in
extant insects may have arisen.

Methods
Beekeeping
Apis mellifera were cultured using standard techniques in
Dunedin, New Zealand. Honeybee embryos were collected from frames removed from nucleus boxes containing small honeybee colonies.

Molecular Cloning
Ovaries were dissected from mated queen bees in PBS and
poly A+ RNA extracted using a quickprep RNA extraction
kit (GE Biosciences). cDNA was generated from this RNA
using superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and
an oligo-DT primer following the manufacturers instructions. PCR was performed on this cDNA using primers for
vasa (tggcaatgtaacgataaaaagacc, AmvasaRNA5' tgggcgacacgatgacaac, AmvasaRNA3') or nanos (gtctccacacgcaccacaa,
AmNanos5' acgccgcaagaaaaataagaaac, AmNanos3'). PCR
products of the correct size were cloned into pGEM-T-Easy
(Promega) following the manufacturers instructions.
Plasmid DNA was isolated from these clones and
sequenced at the Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution.

RNA for RT-PCR experiments was extracted with an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen), treated with RNAse free DNAse (Invitrogen) for 2 hours at 37 degrees, heated to 65 degrees for 30
minutes, and precipitated with ammonium acetate and
isopropanol. First strand synthesis and PCR were performed as above with primers for Amvasa (gcgtttccacccatcatc and gttgtcatcgtgtcgccca and Amnos (as above).
In-situ hybridisation and antibody staining
In-situ hybridisation was performed on ovaries and
embryos as described in Osborne and Dearden [53] and
antibody staining after in-situ hybridisation using the
4D9 anti-engrailed-like antibody [54] as described in
Osborne and Dearden [55].
Confocal microscopy
Ovaries were dissected from mated queen bees and fixed
in a mixture of 4% formaldehyde in PBS: Heptane overnight. Ovaries were washed in methanol and rehydrated
in PTw (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20). The ovaries were treated
with 1 µg/ml RNAse A and PTw for one hour, and then

treated with 0.5 µg/ml Propidium iodide and 0.33 mM
Alexa-Fluor 488 Phalloidin (Molecular probes) overnight
in PTw. The ovaries were washed in PTw four times over
30 minutes and individual ovarioles dissected from the
ovary mass. Individual ovarioles were mounted on microscope slides in 70% glycerol. Confocal imaging was carried out using a Leica confocal microscope.
