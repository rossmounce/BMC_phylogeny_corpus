CC3/TIP30 affects DNA damage repair
Research article

Sylvia Fong, Frank King and Emma Shtivelman*

Abstract
Background: The pro-apoptotic protein CC3/TIP30 has an unusual cellular function as an inhibitor of
nucleocytoplasmic transport. This function is likely to be activated under conditions of stress. A number of studies
support the notion that CC3 acts as a tumor and metastasis suppressor in various types of cancer. The yeast homolog
of CC3 is likely to be involved in responses to DNA damage. Here we examined the potential role of CC3 in regulation of
cellular responses to genotoxic stress.
Results: We found that forced expression of CC3 in CC3-negative cells strongly delays the repair of UV-induced DNA
damage. Exogenously introduced CC3 negatively affects expression levels of DDB2/XPE and p21CIP1, and inhibits
induction of c-FOS after UV exposure. In addition, exogenous CC3 prevents the nuclear accumulation of P21CIP in
response to UV. These changes in the levels/localization of relevant proteins resulting from the enforced expression of
CC3 are likely to contribute to the observed delay in DNA damage repair. Silencing of CC3 in CC3-positive cells has a
modest delaying effect on repair of the UV induced damage, but has a much more significant negative affect on the
translesion DNA synthesis after UV exposure. This could be related to the higher expression levels and increased
nuclear localization of p21CIP1 in cells where expression of CC3 is silenced. Expression of CC3 also inhibits repair of
oxidative DNA damage and leads to a decrease in levels of nucleoredoxin, that could contribute to the reduced
viability of CC3 expressing cells after oxidative insult.
Conclusions: Manipulation of the cellular levels of CC3 alters expression levels and/or subcellular localization of
proteins that exhibit nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. This results in altered responses to genotoxic stress and adversely
affects DNA damage repair by affecting the recruitment of adequate amounts of required proteins to proper cellular
compartments. Excess of cellular CC3 has a significant negative effect on DNA repair after UV and oxidant exposure,
while silencing of endogenous CC3 slightly delays repair of UV-induced damage.
Background
The human gene CC3/TIP30 was originally identified as
a metastasis-suppressor of variant small cell lung carcinoma (vSCLC) [1]. CC3 is a phylogenetically conserved
protein whose expression is absent or much reduced in a
variety of aggressive or metastatic tumors such as vSCLC
[1], neuroblastoma and glioblastoma [2,3], metastatic
breast cancer [4], gastric cancer [5], hepatocellular carcinoma [6,7], colorectal carcinomas [8] and lung cancers
with poor prognosis [9]. Forced expression of CC3 in
vSCLC [1], mouse melanoma, breast carcinoma [10],
hepatocellular carcinoma [6] and gastric carcinoma cell
lines [5] inhibits metastatic behavior in vitro and/or
metastasis in vivo. The deletion of CC3 in germline
results in spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice [11], and

CC3-null mammary epithelial cells undergo immortalization in vitro [12] indicating that CC3 could be not only a
metastasis suppressor, but also a tumor suppressor [13].
One study on the role of TIP30 in metastasis reported
that TIP30 expression actually enhances growth and metastatic behavior of prostate carcinoma cells in vitro [14],
but majority of published results support the hypothesis
that CC3/TIP30 suppresses tumor development and
metastasis.
High levels of acutely overexpressed exogenous CC3
induce apoptosis [1,3] while stable expression of exogenous CC3 results in sensitization of cells to apoptosis
after treatment with a variety of factors such as serum
withdrawal, cytotoxic drugs, γ-irradiation, and microtubule poisons [3]. Expression of CC3 in CC3-negative
tumor cells has an inhibitory effect on the ability of these
cells to produce angiogenic factors in vitro [2], consistent
with the conclusion that down regulation of CC3 contrib-

utes to the development of aggressive metastatic phenotypes.
The precise cellular function of CC3 remains obscure.
A significant sequence homology was reported between
CC3 and short-chain dehydrogenases-reductases or
SDRs [15,16]. CC3 sequence contains a domain, well conserved between CC3 and SDR enzymes, that was predicted to serve as a NADP(H) binding site [15,16], and
the structural analysis of CC3 protein confirmed this prediction [17]. A clue to the potential cellular function of
CC3 came from the findings that CC3 plays an unanticipated inhibitory role in the regulation of nuclear transport [18]. CC3 binds directly to the karyopherins of the
importin β family in a RanGTP-insensitive manner and
associates with nucleoporins in vivo. CC3 inhibits nuclear
import of proteins with either the classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) recognized by importin α:β1, or the M9
signal recognized by transportin (importin β2). Cells
modified to express higher levels of CC3 are predisposed
to apoptosis and have a slower rate of nuclear import
[18]. CC3 protein with mutated NADP(H) binding site
lacks pro-apoptotic activity, is displaced from transportin
by RanGTP, and fails to inhibit nuclear import in vitro
and in vivo. Our results suggest that the ability of CC3 to
form a RanGTP resistant complex with importins and the
NPC is central to its ability to inhibit nuclear import and
induce apoptosis [18].
An independent confirmation for the function of CC3
as a negative regulator of nuclear transport came from
other studies. CC3 was shown to be aberrantly expressed
in the oligodendrocyte precursors found in the lesions
associated with multiple sclerosis. These high levels of
CC3 cause the arrest of the nuclear import of the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD). In these cells NCID,
rather that accumulating in the nuclei, is sequestered in
cytoplasm in a complex with importin and CC3/TIP30
[19]. The observed lack of the nuclear translocation of
NICD leads to the failure of remyelinaiton that could play
a causative role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis [19].
The function of CC3 in nuclear transport is likely to be
evolutionarily conserved. A large scale two-hybrid analysis of the yeast proteome uncovered that the S. cerevisiae
homologue of CC3, YER004w, interacts with exportin
CRM1 and with NTF2 [20], the import factor for
RanGDP. Global analysis of yeast transcriptome changes
after exposure to DNA damaging treatments strongly
indicates that CC3 might be also involved in the DNA
damage responses. The yeast homologue of CC3,
YER004w belongs to a small group of nine genes that are
known as "DNA damage signature set" [21]. Transcription of this group of genes, including YER004w, is
increased significantly and specifically after several different types of DNA damage in a MEC1 (ATR homo-

Page 2 of 14

logue)-dependent manner [21]. Additionally, six of the
genes in the DNA damage signature set, among them
YER004w, are expressed at higher levels in the dna2-1
replication mutant that undergoes premature aging most
likely due to the spontaneously accumulating DNA damage [22]. These data, and the possibly conserved role of
YER004w in nuclear transport in yeast, indicate that the
yeast homologue of CC3 could be involved in control of
nuclear transport in response to DNA damage.
We have initiated this work to examine the potential
role of human CC3 in regulation of DNA damage
responses. We report here that enforced expression of
exogenous CC3 significantly impairs the repair of DNA
after exposure to UV and oxidative agent as well as negatively influences cell survival, while silencing of endogenous CC3 in human cells has a mild delaying effect on
repair of UV induced damage. Our results are consistent
with findings that demonstrate a role for CC3 in decreasing cell survival in response to a variety of death signals
including DNA damage.

Results
Excess of CC3 impairs the repair of DNA damage

For the initial assessment of the potential effects of CC3
on repair of UV induced DNA damage we have employed
the host cell reactivation assay (HCR). HCR is a transfection-based assay in which cells repair transfected UV
damaged reporter plasmid. Through measurement of the
activity of a reporter enzyme, the relative amount of damaged plasmid that a cell can "reactivate" or repair, and
express, can be quantified. We have used a firefly
luciferase reporter plasmid damaged by UV and a Renilla
luciferase plasmid as an internal control of the transfection efficiency. These luciferase plasmids were co-transfected into recipient HeLa cells along with the effector
plasmids (empty vector or CC3-expressing), and dual
luciferase activity assays were performed 24 hours after
transfection.
CC3 expression vectors for wild type CC3 and the
mutant version with a mutation in the NADPH binding
site, as well as the empty vector, were used as effector
plasmids. The mutant version of CC3 (G28A, G31A) does
not bind to importins in a Ran-independent manner, and
does not inhibit nuclear transport [18]. Results in Figure
1A show that expression of wild type but not mutant CC3
negatively affects repair of DNA damage. Transfection of
twice higher amount of wild type CC3 vector (2×) had a
stronger inhibitory effect of the repair of DNA damage
(Figure 1A) indicating a dose response relationship
between the amounts of CC3 and inhibition of DNA
repair.
To confirm the inhibitory role of CC3 in UV induced
DNA damage repair, HCR was conducted in CC3-nega-

Figure 1 Host cell reactivation of the UV-damaged plasmid in
presence of exogenously expressed CC3. (A). HeLa cells were transfected as described in Methods with reporter plasmids and either 1×
or 2× amount of effector plasmids indicated. Fold HCR in presence of
control, wild type CC3 and mutant CC3 plasmids is shown. P values
were determined by t-test, n = 3. Shown are the statistical significances
of differences seen between 1× amount of CC3 versus 1× amount vector (0.064), 1× mutant CC3 versus vector (0.264) and for 2× amounts of
CC3 versus vector (0.0065) and mutant/vector (0.211). (B). Expression of
CC3 protein in U373neo and stably transfected U373cc3 cells determined by Western blot analysis of cell extracts using antibody to CC3
[18]. Antibody to hnRNPI was used for loading control. (C). U373 cell
clones, control (U373neo) and CC3 expressing (U373cc3) were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids and analyzed for HCR. All results are average of three transfections performed in duplicates.

tive glioblastoma cell line U373 stably transfected with
exogenous CC3 ([2] and Figure 1B). Out of several CC3negative transformed cell lines that were stably transfected with CC3 [2], we have chosen the U373 cells
because, unlike in other lines, expression of exogenous
CC3 had no noticeable effect on the proliferation rate of
U373, and did not induce an appreciable increase in their
susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli such as UV irradiation
or DNA damaging drugs (data not shown; Additional File
1). This allowed monitoring the repair of DNA damage
without interference from the different growth rates or
from differential induction of cell death by UV. A control
clone transfected with empty vector (U373neo) and a
clone expressing moderate levels of CC3 (U373cc3) were
used in HCR assay with luciferase reporters. Figure 1C
shows that in U373neo cells the repair is more efficient
that in U373cc3, thus confirming the inhibitory effect of
CC3 on DNA damage repair in an additional cellular context.

Irradiation of cells with UVC light induces two major
types of mutagenic DNA photoproducts: cyclobutane
pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PP). The latter are repaired relatively quickly, while repair of CPDs can continue for
periods well over 24 hours. We have used the comet assay
to examine repair of 6-4PP and other fast-repaired lesions
such as oxidized nucleotides and apurinic/apyrimidininc
bases, while CPDs were detected with a specific antibody
by ELISA. Figure 2A shows that repair of 6-4PP is significantly delayed in U373cc3 cells. In control cells the maximum number of breaks, resulting from recognition and
excision of damaged bases, was observed at 30 minutes
after exposure, whereas in U373cc3 cells the maximum
number of comets was observed at 3 hours after exposure. This suggests that the process of damage recognition and/or excision is delayed in U373cc3 cells, while the
fill-in synthesis and ligation proceed normally, because by
4 hours after exposure both clones have mostly repaired
the fast-repaired UV-induced lesions.
Repair of CPD was monitored over a period of 24
hours. Figure 2B shows that removal of CPD is also significantly delayed in U373cc3 cells, and after 24 hours
60% of CPDs remain unrepaired in DNA from U373cc3
cells versus less than 40% in control cells.
We have examined if delays in DNA damage repair
observed in U373cc3 cells have an effect on cell viability
or proliferation. Cell death assays (binding of Annexin V
and permeability to propidium iodide) showed no appreciable apoptosis or non-apoptotic cell death in either of
U373 clones subjected to UV at 15 J/m2 (not shown). The
short term (up to 72 hours) cell proliferation was quantified using CCK-8 assay, and Figure 2C shows that proliferation after UV exposure was somewhat slower in
U373cc3 cells, but the decrease was relatively minor. The
colony formation after UV exposure was affected by CC3
only slightly, decreasing the number of colonies formed
by U373cc3 cells by 5 to 10% compared to U373neo (not
shown). Glioblastoma cells are notoriously resistant to
death induced by DNA damage, and expression of CC3
apparently does not affect the apoptotic resistance of
these cells.
Silencing of CC3 has a modest effect on the repair of CPD
lesions

We have next examined if silencing of CC3 expression
affects the efficiency of DNA damage repair. Expression
of CC3 was silenced in MCF10A cells, which derive from
immortalized normal mammary epithelium (Additional
File 1 contains information about all cell lines used in this
study). These cells were infected with lentivirus express-

Figure 2 Delay in repair of UV-induced DNA damage induced by
exogenously expressed CC3. (A). U373 clonal populations, control
(U3neo) and stably expressing CC3 (U3cc3), were irradiated with 15 J/
m2 UVC and harvested at different times after exposure. After lysis and
denaturation, cells were subjected to Comet assay analysis according
to the manufacturer's (Trevigen) protocol. (B). Cells were exposed to
UV as in A, and the cellular DNA was isolated at the times indicated. The
repair of CPD lesions was quantified using ELISA with an anti-CPD antibody. All results are average of three experiments. (C). Proliferation of
U373 clones subjected to 15 J/m2 UVC in a short-term assay. Cells were
analyzed as described in Materials and methods; results are expressed
as percent of untreated cultures; experiments were performed three
times with cells plated in triplicate or quadruplicate for each experiment.

ing CC3 specific shRNA and puromycin resistance gene,
and after selection the infected population showed very
little residual expression of CC3 (Figure 3A). Examination
of the fast branch of repair of the UV induced DNA damage (removal of 6-4PP) did not detect any significant differences in the rate of repair (not shown). However, repair
of CPD as measured by ELISA showed a somewhat
slower kinetic of CPD removal in MCF10A cells with
silenced CC3, though at 24 hours similar percentages of
CPD were repaired in both cell populations (Figure 3B).
This was somewhat unexpected considering that the
exogenously expressed CC3 has an inhibitory effect on
repair of CPD lesions (Figure 2B).
To examine if the results obtained using MCF10A cells
with silenced CC3 are unique to this cell line, we have
silenced CC3 expression in a breast cancer cell line
MCF7. We have again observed a modest delay in the
removal of CPD (Figure 3C). To further confirm these
results, we performed immunoblot analysis of DNA from
UV-irradiated cells with a different anti-CPD antibody.
As shown in Figure 3D, the delay in repair in cells with
silenced CC3 was also detected by blotting assay in MCF7
cells, as well as in MCF10A cells (not shown). This confirms that the reduction in the levels of endogenous CC3
has a modest delaying effect on repair of UV induced
DNA damage. This minor delay in the repair of CPD in
absence of CC3 had no effect on the viability of cells after
UV exposure (not shown). However, we have observed
that silencing of CC3 had a negative effect on cell proliferation after UV exposure (see below).
Changes in gene expression in cells forced to express CC3

To address the possible causes of the impaired repair of
UV induced DNA damage we have conducted expression
array analysis of U373neo and U373cc3 cells, before and
after treatment with UV. The array analysis showed
expression changes in a large number of transcripts in
untreated U373cc3 cells compared to U373neo (Additional File 2). These transcripts represented genes that
could be involved in a wide variety of cellular processes.
Examination of genes induced by UV exposure showed
that in general transcriptional responses to UV of U373
cells with or without CC3 expression are very similar; i.e.
same mRNAs are induced or repressed in both cell lines,
with a few exceptions (Additional File 3). This indicates
that the transcriptional program induced by UV remains
essentially unchanged in presence of exogenous CC3.
Two of the transcriptional changes observed in CC3
expressing cells versus parental U373 cells could be
directly related to the differences in the UV induced DNA
damage repair between the clones. Array results showed
a rather high upregulation of the c-FOS transcript (13.2

fold) in untreated U373cc3 cells versus U373neo, and 2.7
fold downregulation of DDB2 (Additional File 2). c-FOS
is an early response gene induced by UV [23], and was
shown to be required for the efficient repair of the UVinduced DNA damage [24-26]. DDB2, also known as
Xeroderma pigmentosum group E, is intimately involved
in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA damage
by recruiting ubiquitinating protein complex of DDB1cullin 4A [27].
Changes in the expression of the RNA for c-FOS were
examined by quantitative RT-PCR. We have also examined expression of EGR1, an early response gene induced,
among other treatments, by UV [28,29], because the
array results showed upregulation of EGR-1 in untreated
U373cc3 cells versus U373neo (Additional File 2).
U373cc3 cells showed a major increase in transcription of
c-FOS and EGR1 compared to U373neo (Figure 4A), but

the protein levels of c-FOS (Figure 4B) and EGR-1 (not
shown) in untreated U373 clones were not affected indicating that the increase in c-FOS transcription in
U373cc3 cells does not results in the increase in protein
levels. The array analysis also showed that UV induces cFOS in U373neo cells (2. 5 fold) but not in U373cc3 (Supplemental File 2). Western blotting confirmed induction
of c-FOS protein by UV only in U373neo cells (Figure
4B). To examine if CC3-induced inhibition of c-FOS
induction by UV is unique to U373 cells, we have analyzed levels of c-FOS in CC3 null HepG2 cells transduced
with a CC3 expressing lentivirus. Similar to U373 cells,
exogenous CC3 also had a delaying effect on the repair of
CPD lesions in transduced HepG2 cells (data not shown).
Figure 4B shows that introduction of CC3 into HepG2
resulted in increase of basal c-FOS levels in untreated
cells (not observed in U373cc3 cells even though RNA

levels were higher), but, similar to the observations with
U373 cells, prevented increase in c-FOS after UV exposure. These data indicate that exogenous CC3 might prevent induction of c-FOS by relatively low doses of UV (cFOS was induced by UV of 40 and 60 J/m2 in all cell lines;
data not shown). We have not detected any effect of CC3
on subcellular localization of c-FOS which was exclusively nuclear in all cells (not shown).
We have then examined expression of c-FOS in cells
with silenced CC3, expecting that perhaps the latter will
have an enhancing effect on c-FOS induction by UV.
Indeed, while there was no change in the basal levels of cFOS in MCF10A cells with silenced CC3, induction of
this protein by UV was much higher in MCF10A cells
with silenced CC3 (Figure 4B). These observations suggest that both endogenous and exogenous CC3 might
restrain induction of c-FOS by UV in different cellular
contexts.
Next, we examined expression of DDB2 protein in cell
lines where CC3 expression was manipulated. Figure 5A
shows that the basal levels of DDB2 are lower in U373cc3
cells, in agreement with transcriptional downregulation
found in the expression array analysis (Additional File 2).
The basal levels of DDB2 protein were found to be higher
in both MCF10A and MCF7 cells where CC3 was
silenced (Figure 5B). These data indicate that CC3 has an
inhibitory affect on expression of DDB2. We have examined the subcellular localization of DDB2 protein in various lines used above, but DDB2 was nuclear in all cells.
We suggest that lower levels of DDB2 could be directly
relevant to the delay in repair seen in U373cc3 cells.
CC3 expression increases levels and nuclear localization of
p21CIP1

In a recent publication, CC3 was reported to regulate levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 (CDKN1A) via stabilization of their mRNAs [30]. In addition, p21 protein levels
have been shown to be regulated by DDB2 [31]. We have
therefore examined if manipulation of CC3 affects the

levels of p21CIP1 because p21CIP1 was shown to be
involved in the UV induced DNA damage response in
numerous publications. Western blot analysis of U373
cells for p21CIP1 showed somewhat lower levels in
U373cc3 cells compared to U373neo, and disappearance
of detectable p21 after UV exposure. We could not reliably examine the subcellular localization of p21CIP1 by
immunofluorescence in U373 cells because these cells
have very low levels of p21CIP1 most likely due to the
lack of functional p53.
We have therefore examined levels and localization of
p21 in CC3 protein null HepG2 cells that express p53.
HepG2 cells were transduced with a CC3 expressing lentivirus (HepG2cc3) or a control vector (HepG2con).
Expression of exogenous CC3 in HepG2 cells lead to a
decrease in the basal levels of p21CIP1, and prevented the
increase in its levels and nuclear localization after UV
exposure observed in HepG2con cells (Figure 5C and
5D). Changes in levels and localization of p21CIP1 in
cells with exogenously expressed CC3 are likely independent of p53-dependent regulation of p21, because the levels of p53 were only marginally affected by CC3
expression (Figure 5C), and the exclusively nuclear localization of p53 in HepG2 cells was not affected by CC3
(not shown).
Examination of MCF10A and MCF7 cells with silenced
CC3 showed that in both cell lines abrogation of CC3
protein expression leads to increased basal levels of p21,
but no further increase at 2 hours after UV exposure,
unlike in control cells (Figure 5B). Silencing of CC3 did
not affect the levels of p53 in cells before or 2 hours after
UV exposure (Figure 5) (levels of p53 were increased at
later times after UV exposure in both control and CC3silenced cells; not shown). We have examined the subcellular localization of p21CIP1 in cells before and after UV
irradiation. In untreated cells, similar percentages of cells
had predominantly nuclear p21CIP1 irrespective of their
CC3 status, but exposure to UV led to the nuclear accumulation of p21CIP1 in a higher percentage of CC3-

Figure 5F shows that the number of cells in S phase after
UV irradiation was significantly reduced in MCF10Acc3si cells, which have higher levels of p21 that the control
cells (Figure 4B). Considering that the effect of CC3
silencing on the efficiency of DNA repair was relatively
minor in MCF10A and MCF7 cells (Figure 3), we conclude that the silencing of CC3 has a minor effect on the
efficiency of DNA repair but strongly impairs the translesion DNA synthesis probably through increase in levels of
nuclear p21.

endogenous p21CIP1 in HepG2 cells with or without exogenously expressed CC3. Cells were stained for CC3 and p21CIP1 before and 2

antibody.

silenced cells (Figure 5E). We have not detected changes
in localization of p53 protein as a consequence of CC3
silencing (not shown). We conclude that lack of CC3
expression leads to increased nuclear localization of p21
after DNA damage.
Even though p21CIP1 has been implicated in regulation
of DNA damage repair itself, some older and recent publications suggest that it is a negative regulator of the
translesion (TSL) DNA synthesis after UV exposure. To
examine if TSL is affected in MCF10cc3-si cells, we have
examined the rate of DNA synthesis after UV exposure.

We have examined if repair of oxidative DNA damage is
also affected by the exogenously introduced CC3 expression. U373 clones were treated with hydrogen peroxide
for a short time and allowed to recover in fresh medium.
Repair of oxidative damage was monitored by comet
assay. Figure 6A shows that cells expressing CC3 have a
decreased capacity for the repair of oxidative lesions in
DNA. A similar deficiency in the repair of oxidative DNA
damage was observed in a small cell lung carcinoma cells
N417 (CC3-null) forced to express exogenous CC3 (Figure 6B).
The array expression analysis of U373 clones (Additional File 2) identified nucleoredoxin [32], a gene of the
peroxiredoxin family, as downregulated 13.7 fold in
U373cc3 cells. Nucleoredoxin (NXN) is involved in regulation of Wnt signaling pathway during oxidative stress
and [33], and similar to the other members of the peroxiredoxin family, could be related to the control of the
reactive oxygen species after oxidative insult. We examined levels of nucleoredoxin first by quantitative RT-PCR
in U373 and N417 cell lines with and without CC3 and
confirmed a very significant decrease in the transcript
levels in presence of CC3 (Figure 6C).
Next, we have examined the levels of the nucleoredoxin
protein by Western blot analysis. Unexpectedly, nucleoredoxin levels were not diminished in U373cc3 cells compared to U373neo cells in spite of the very significant
reduction in RNA level (Figure 6D). Therefore, in U373
cells the impairment of the oxidative DNA damage repair
is unlikely to be a direct or indirect consequence of the
reduced levels of nucleoredoxin. In addition, the levels of
both endogenous and peroxide treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U373cc3 and U373neo cells
were quantitatively similar, as measured by flow cytometric analysis of cells pre-loaded with ROS- sensitive probe
CM-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes; not shown). Analysis
of cell survival after treatment with peroxide showed that
it is diminished in U373 cells (Figure 6E), indicating that
the delayed repair of oxidative damage might impact cell
survival.
Because we have observed that in U373cc3 cells transcriptional changes are not necessarily "translated" into

Figure 6 CC3 impairs repair of oxidative DNA damage and reduces levels of nucleoredoxin RNA and protein. (A). Comet assays were performed with U373neo and cc3 cells, either untreated (UT) or treated with 25 μM hydrogen peroxide for 15 mins, after witch peroxide was removed
and cells were allowed to recover in fresh medium for additional 15 and 30 minutes. Results are average of three independent experiments. (B). Same
as in (A), with N417neo and cc3 cells except the concentration of H2O2 was 10 μM. (C). Quantitative RT-PCR of steady-state NXN RNA levels was performed with RNAs isolated from the cells with or with exogenously introduced CC3. (D) Western blot analysis of nucleoredoxin expression in paired
cells, control transfected (neo) or stably transfected with CC3. E. Viability of U373 clones subjected to treatment with 100 μM H2O2 for 30 minutes. Cells
were analyzed as described in Materials and methods; experiments were performed three times with cells plated in triplicate or quadruplicate for each
experimental point.

corresponding changes in protein levels (as seen with cFOS, EGR1 and nucleoredoxin), we have examined
expression of nucleoredoxin in other cells stably transfected with CC3. In N417cc3 cells nucleoredoxin protein
was almost undetectable (Figure 6D). A significant reduction in nucleoredoxin protein levels was seen in two other
lines forced to stably express exogenous CC3: CC3-negative neuroblastoma SKNSH and CC3-low breast carcinoma MDA MB 468 (Figure 5D). This suggests that
suppression of nucleoredoxin expression by CC3 might
be a common consequence of forced CC3 expression.

Discussion
Our data show that the forced expression of exogenous
CC3 and, to a much lesser degree, silencing of endoge-

nous CC3 delay the repair of UV induced DNA damage.
These findings are not entirely contradictory considering
the role of CC3 in the regulation of nuclear transport.
Changes in levels of CC3 could disrupt the existing balance in the nuclear import and export of any number of
shuttling proteins, including those involved in DNA damage repair.
We have chosen to examine the possible consequences
of forced expression of CC3 on DNA damage repair in a
glioblastoma cell line lacking endogenous CC3, because
introduction of CC3 did not affect its proliferation rate or
sensitivity to death signals, unlike negative effects
reported in many other tumor cell lines stably transfected
with CC3 ([2]). Therefore, we were able to analyze effects
of CC3 on DNA damage repair apart from the described

Fong et al. BMC Cell Biology 2010, 11:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/11/23

negative effects of CC3 expression on cell survival and
growth rate. In retrospect, however, we observed that
some transcriptional changes induced by CC3 in U373
cells did not result in corresponding changes in protein
levels (increases in c-FOS, EGR-1 and a decrease in
nucleoredoxin). The lack of correlation between a change
in a certain mRNA level and a corresponding change in
level of protein it encodes appears to be limited to U373
cells. In particular, the FOS protein is induced by CC3 in
HepG2 but not in U373 (Figure 4B); nucleoredoxin is
downregulated by CC3 in three tumor cell lines but not in
U373 (Figure 6D); vimentin, whose RNA is upregulated
300 fold in U373cc3 cells (Additional File 2) is practically
unchanged at the protein level, but is strongly induced in
N417 cells (data not shown). It appears that the U373
cells exercise a strong post-transcriptional control of protein levels in U373 cells, either at the level of translation
per se, or by altering protein stability. This could be relevant to the ability of these cells to maintain levels of critical proteins that are compatible with the high
proliferation rate and apoptotic resistance characteristic
for glioblastoma.
We have attempted to identify some of the proteins relevant to DNA damage responses whose levels/localization are affected by changes in CC3 levels. The RNA
expression array analysis was based on a rationale that
CC3 might affect nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of certain
transcription factors, which could have consequences for
the expression levels of a number genes that are co-regulated by these transcription factors. In particular, we were
interested to find if the introduction of CC3 into CC3negative cells might have a generalized effect on transcription changes induced by UV. As seen in the Additional File 3, the sets of genes affected by UV in CC3negative versus CC3-expressing cells are remarkably similar, excepting a few quantitative changes in the degree of
suppression/induction. This indicates that CC3 expression does not induce a major shift in the transcriptional
response to UV.
This is, perhaps, not surprising, considering that cells
differing in CC3 expression could be expected to have
significant changes in subcellular localization of the relevant shuttling proteins rather than changes in their
mRNA levels. We have detected changes in the expression levels of two proteins closely related to NER: DDB2
and p21CIP1; in addition, the well-known induction of cFOS by UV was significantly inhibited in CC3-expressing
cells, and increased in CC3-silenced cells (Figure 4). The
role of DDB2/XPE in NER has been studied extensively,
but remains incompletely understood. Thus, degradation
of DDB2 is thought to be essential for the initial stages of
NER, but DDB complex activity is dispensable for the
NER in vitro ([34] and references therein). The prevailing
notion was that DDB2 is an essential part of the UV-acti-

Page 9 of 14

vated DDB1-DDB2-CUL4A ubiquitin ligase, and as such
participates in the initiation of global NER. This complex
was variously reported to be responsible for degradation
of DDB2 itself [35] or ubiquitination of histones at the
sites of damage [36,37]. However, a very recent report
showed that ablation of Cul4A, a ubiquitin ligase in the
complex, actually increases the capacity of normal cells to
repair UV damaged DNA [38]. DDB2 was shown to act as
a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor [39], but to complicate the issue further, DDB2 is expressed at higher levels
in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, and its
knockdown negatively impacts the growth rate of these
cells [40]. This, however, could be due to the functions
that DDB2 likely has in cellular processes other than
NER. We show that DDB2 levels are increased in
MCF10A and MCF7 cells when CC3 expression is
silenced, and DDB2 levels are decreased in U373 cells
forced to express CC3. The latter change correlates with a
slower kinetics of UV induced DNA damage repair. We
conclude that expression of CC3 has an inhibitory effect
on expression of DDB2, and that could play a role in the
delay of DNA repair.
The role of p21CIP1WAF/CIP1 in NER remains controversial, in spite of hundreds of research papers published on the topic. Earlier reports indicated that higher
levels of p21CIP1 are not inhibitory for NER, but can
inhibit translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) [41], while subsequent publications suggested an inhibitory role of p21
in the repair process itself via its interaction with PCNA
(reviewed in [42]). p21 was strongly implicated in the
negative regulation of TLS, preventing association of
polymerase eta with PCNA [43-45]. Our findings show
that increased levels of p21CIP1 in cells where CC3 is
silenced correlate with the significant inhibition of TLS,
but have a minor effect on UV induced DNA damage
repair.
Expression of c-FOS was shown to be necessary for the
efficient repair of UV-induced DNA damage [24,25], and
c-FOS negative cells show a significant decrease in their
repair capacity. Two cell lines expressing exogenously
introduced CC3 (U373 and HepG2) fail to increase
expression of c-FOS after UV exposure, which could be a
contributing factor to the observed delay in repair. Our
observations of the complex effects that manipulation of
CC3 levels has on levels of the three investigated proteins
relevant to DNA damage responses are illustrated in Figure 7.
We have also investigated the effect of manipulating
levels of CC3 on the DNA damage repair and cell survival
after oxidative stress. While we could not detect any
effects of CC3 knockdown on the repair of oxidative
DNA damage, excess of cellular CC3 significantly delayed
repair, and, in addition, had a negative effect on cell proliferation. These findings are in agreement with the pub-

Figure 7 Schematic illustration of the proposed/expected mechanism of the effects of CC3/TIP30 on responses to DNA damage.
The scheme illustrates changes in expression of thee proteins involved
in DNA damage responses depending on changes in levels of CC3.
Changes in protein levels are represented as increases/decreases in
the font size or thickness compared to the uniform size of font used for
all proteins in the middle part of the scheme ("CC3/TIP30 unchanged")
prior to UV treatment. Overexpression of CC3 (top part) leads to higher
levels of c-FOS and lower levels of p21 and DDB2, while silencing of
CC3 has no effect on c-FOS in untreated cells, but significantly increases levels of DDB2 and p21CIP. After exposure to UV cells expressing exogenous CC3 protein fail to increase levels of FOS and p21CIP. They
also accumulate less p21CIP in their nuclei after UV exposure (Figure
5D). This could contribute to the deficiency in repair of DNA damage.
Cells where CC3 expression is silenced (lower part. "CC3/TIP30 KD) continue to maintain the already higher levels of p21CIP without further
increasing it. More of these cells have nuclear p21 (Figure 5E). They also
show a higher increase in the levels of FOS after UV exposure. Altogether, these changes observed after CC3 knockdown have minor
consequences for the repair of DNA damage, but significantly inhibit
DNA translesion synthesis (TLS) after DNA damage likely due to high
levels of p21CIP.

lished results that overexpression of CC3 leads to
increased sensitivity to the apoptotic induction by oxidative stress [30]. An increase in levels of p53 and p21 proteins trough the stabilization of the p53 RNA was
suggested to play a role in predisposition to apoptosis
induced by CC3 expression.
It is possible that the delays in repair of oxidative DNA
damage induced by CC3 might contribute to the lower
survival of glioblastoma cells expressing exogenous CC3
(Figure 6E). Other cell lines forced to express CC3 (Figure
6D) also show an impaired survival after treatment with
oxidative agents (not shown). In these cell lines, the negative effect on viability could be due not only to impaired
DNA repair, but also to a decrease in levels of nucleoredoxin, induced by CC3 (Figure 5). Lower levels of nucleoredoxin in cells forced to express CC3 could result in
lowered ability to neutralize ROS, more severe DNA and
other types of oxidative damage, and consequently more
death. Indeed, N417 cells expressing exogenous CC3 have
higher levels of endogenous ROS as measured by conversion of ROS-sensitive probe CM-H2DCFDA to fluorescent form (data not shown). The possible role of
nucleoredoxin in this process has not been studied, but

peroxiredoxins in general have been implicated in the
ability of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae [46] and mammalian cells [47] to protect themselves from the deleterious effects of oxidative insults on DNA repair, genomic
stability and survival. Nucleoredoxin was shown to act as
a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
peroxide-treated cells [33]. The long-term consequences
of this effect on cell survival have not been investigated.
However, assuming that nucleoredoxin shares with other
peroxiredoxins the ability to control ROS levels, it is reasonable to suggest that lowering levels of cellular nucleoredoxin will have an adverse effect on cell survival after
oxidative insult.

Conclusions
Our experiments show that exogenously expressed CC3,
by virtue of its effects on levels and subcellular localization of proteins involved in DNA damage responses, negatively affects DNA damage repair after both UV
exposure and oxidative stress. We have identified c-FOS,
DDB2 and p21CIP as proteins whose levels or localization are affected by CC3, and these changes are potential
culprits in the effects of CC3 on cellular responses to UV.
Our findings are consistent with the known role of CC3/
TIP30 in impairing cell survival after apoptotic treatments and its role as a tumor and metastasis suppressor.
Inhibition of nuclear transport by CC3 most likely plays a
role in its activity as metastasis suppressor and cell death
promoter. Further work will be needed to identify critical
proteins whose localization is affected by CC3 and
impacts responses to DNA damage.
Methods
Cells, transduction and transfection

All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC, and propagated according to the instructions provided. SiRNA constructs in the LKO plasmid vector for the production of
lentivirus - mediated siRNA expression were purchased
from Open Biosystems/Thermo. Viruses were produced
in HEK293 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions and used to transduce cells, followed by selection in
pre-determined concentration of puromycin. Stably
transfected clonal populations of U373, N417 and
SKNSH cells were selected and described earlier [2,3].
HCR assay

The HCR assay was conducted as described previously
[48]. The firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pFLuc)
either damaged with 1000 J/m2 or undamaged was contransfected with undamaged Renilla luciferase pRLuc as
an internal transfection control and with effector plasmids: pCMVneo3, pCMV-CC3 and pCMV-CC3 mut
with Fugene (Roche) on 24 well plates. At 24 hours after

Fong et al. BMC Cell Biology 2010, 11:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/11/23

transfection, cells were lyzed and assayed for Renilla and
Firefly luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Activity assay (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity of each
sample was normalized to the Renilla activity. To determine the repair capacity of cells transfected with different
reporters, repair conversion was calculated first by dividing the normalized firefly luciferase activity from cells
transfected with the UV-damaged pFLuc by that of
undamaged pFLuc transfected cultures. The fold HCR
was calculated by dividing the repair conversion of effector transfectants by that of vector transfectants.
Comet assay

Comet assays were conducted using Trevigen comet
assay kits according to manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization at different
times after treatment with UV or hydrogen peroxide, and
embedded into low-melting agarose. Embedded cells
were gently lyzed, and the nuclear DNA was denatured
with alkali. Cells in agarose were subjected to electrophoresis in the alkaline buffer, and after drying were stained
with SYBRgreen. Comets were counted under fluorescent
microscope. At least 300 nuclei were counted for each
sample.
Detection of CPDs by ELISA

Cells were seeded on 6-cm culture dishes at 5 × 105 per
well and irradiated next day with 15 J/m2
UVC. Cells were harvested immediately or at different
times after irradiation, and genomic DNA was isolated
(DNeasy cell and tissue kit; Qiagen). ELISA (in triplicate)
was performed in 96-well plates precoated with 0.06%
protamine sulfate (Sigma). For CPD detection with
TDM-2 antibody (Cosmo Bio), 30 ng of heat-denatured
DNA in PBS was added to the wells and dried at 37°C for
16-20 h. The monoclonal antibody TDM-2 was added to
the wells at 0.05 μg/ml and incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
The plates then were incubated with affinity-purified
goat anti-mouse immunogloblin G conjugated with peroxidase (Zymed) at 37°C for 90 min. Finally, the substrate
solution, consisting of 0.04% o-phenylene diamine and
0.007% H2O2 in citrate-phosphate buffer, was added to
each well for 30 minutes. Sulfuric acid was added to stop
the reaction and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured
using a Microplate Reader Spectra MAX.
Detection of CPDs by Immuno-slot blot

100 ng of DNA was diluted into DNA denaturation solution (1.5 M NaCl: 0.5 M NaOH) and applied to a positively charged nylon membrane by vacuum blotting. The
DNA on membrane was washed with a neutralizing buffer (0.5 M Tris; 1.0 M NaCl, pH 7.5). The membrane was
baked at 80°C for 20 minutes and blocked by incubating
in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat

Page 11 of 14

milk (blocking buffer) overnight at 4°C. After multiple
washes with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated with
anti-CPD antibody (Kamiya) in blocking buffer for 2 h at
room temperature. The membrane was washed thoroughly with PBS-T and further incubated with an antimouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody
(Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature (1:5,000 dilution in
PBS-T). The membrane was developed with the chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) and detected on Kodak
Imager 2000R using Kodak Molecular Imaging software.
Cell viability tests

Short term effects of various treatments were analyzed
using the WST-8 cell proliferation assay with the Cell
counting kit CCK-8 from Dojindo. Briefly, cells were
plated on 96 well palates, subjected to treatments in triplicates or quadruplicates, and the number of live cells was
evaluated one, two and three days later. For colony-forming assay, cells were plated at 1000 on 6 cm plates overnight, and subjected to UV exposure. Fifteen days later
the colonies were stained with Crystal Violet and
counted.
Western blotting

Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (140 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. 1 mM DTT, 0,5%
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X100 and protease
inhibitors). For analysis of DDB2, RIPA buffer contained
420 mM NaCl. Cell lysates were electrophoresed on SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
Membranes were blotted with antibodies at recommended concentrations overnight at 4°C and the bound
primary antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using
SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce)
and imaged on Kodak Imager ISR2000.
RNA isolation and microarray analysis

U373neo and U373cc3 were exposed to UV at 15 J/m2
and left to recover for 2 hours. These cells, along with
untreated cells, were each harvested in triplicates for
microarray experiment. Total RNA was isolated using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was used for Cy5-labeled
aRNA preparation per manufacturer instruction
(Ambion MessageAmp™ aRNA Amplification Kit,
Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA).
The microarray experiments were performed using
Phalanx Human OneArray™ Version 4.1 (HOA 4.1; Phalanx Biotech Group, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan). Each
microarray contains 32,050 oligonucleotide probes that
include 30,968 human gene probes for transcription
expression profiling and 1082 experimental control
probes. Detailed descriptions of the gene array list,

hybridization and processing procedures are available
from http://www.phalanxbiotech.com/.
In brief, each Cy5 labeled aRNA was hybridized to
HOA 4.1 microarrays in triplicate. Prior to the microarray hybridization, the Cy5 labeled aRNAs were fragmented using the reagents and protocol provided in
Ambion RNA Fragmentation Reagents kit (Ambion Inc.,
Austin, TX). Fragmented Cy5-labeled aRNA were suspended in OneArray™ hybridization buffer (provided in
HOA product package) at a final volume of 180 μl per
hybridization. The pre-hybridization blocking, array
hybridization, and post-hybridization washes were performed according to the instruction provided in the HOA
User Guide. The arrays were then scanned using GenePix
4000B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the
fluorescent intensities were extracted from the generated
images by following the instructions and the conditions
described in HOA User Guide. The raw intensity data
were input to GeneSpring GX Version 7.3.1 (Agilent, Foster City, CA, USA). The averaged intensities for each
probe then were normalized by quantile normalization.
Differentially expressed genes were identified, and filtered based on t-tests (p < 0.05). The results of microarray analysis are available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE20633
Real-Time Quantitative PCR

Total RNA was isolated as described above. Five μg of
total RNA was treated with 20 units of DNase and reverse
transcribed with oligo dT:random primer (1:1 at 1.5 μg
each) by using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Fifty nanograms of first-strand cDNA were used in subsequent realtime PCR carried out with iQ5 (Bio-Rad) by using SyBr
green dye (Applied Biosystems) as the fluorescent probe
with gene-specific primer sets. The following parameters
were used in the PCR: 10 min denaturation at 95°C, 35
cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, and 1 min at 55°C. To quantify
fold expression changes compared to control, the ΔΔCT
methods were used [49]. CT is the point at which the fluorescence signal rises above the baseline fluorescence and
begins to increase exponentially. The CT value is in logarithmic inverse relationship with the abundance of the
transcripts, based on the assumption that CT values
increase by 1 for each twofold dilution.

BrdU incorporation

Cells in culture were incubated with 30 μM of BrdU for
30 minutes, after which BrdU containing media were
removed, cells washed with PBS and incubated for additional 1.5 hours in fresh media. Cells were harvested,
fixed in 70% ethanol and processed for staining with antiBrdU, FITC-conjugated antibody (Becton Dickinson)
according to supplier's protocol. Cells were counterstained with propidium iodide and analyzed on FACScan.
