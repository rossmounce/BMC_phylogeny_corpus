Abstract
Background: Plant MADS box proteins play important roles in a plethora of developmental
processes. In order to regulate specific sets of target genes, MADS box proteins dimerize and are
thought to assemble into multimeric complexes. In this study a large-scale yeast three-hybrid
screen is utilized to provide insight into the higher-order complex formation capacity of the
Arabidopsis MADS box family. SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) has been shown to mediate complex formation
and, therefore, special attention is paid to this factor in this study.
Results: In total, 106 multimeric complexes were identified; in more than half of these at least one
SEP protein was present. Besides the known complexes involved in determining floral organ
identity, various complexes consisting of combinations of proteins known to play a role in floral
organ identity specification, and flowering time determination were discovered. The capacity to
form this latter type of complex suggests that homeotic factors play essential roles in downregulation of the MADS box genes involved in floral timing in the flower via negative autoregulatory loops. Furthermore, various novel complexes were identified that may be important for
the direct regulation of the floral transition process. A subsequent detailed analysis of the
APETALA3, PISTILLATA, and SEP3 proteins in living plant cells suggests the formation of a
multimeric complex in vivo.
Conclusions: Overall, these results provide strong indications that higher-order complex
formation is a general and essential molecular mechanism for plant MADS box protein functioning
and attribute a pivotal role to the SEP3 'glue' protein in mediating multimerization.

Background

Since the isolation of the first plant MADS box transcription
factor gene, substantial knowledge has been gained about the
biological functions of these developmental regulators in various plant species. A thorough analysis of the complete
genome sequence from the model species Arabidopsis thaliana revealed the presence of 107 different members belonging to this transcription factor family, with known or
predicted functions in floral induction, plant architecture,
female gametophyte development, fruit formation, fruit ripening, pod shattering, nitrate signaling and floral organ
development [1-3]. Already in the early 1990s, genetic studies
using floral organ mutants in Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum
majus, representing mutations in mainly MADS box transcription factor genes, led to the establishment of the robust
'ABC model' for floral organ formation [4]. According to this
original model, organ identities are determined by combinations of three functions, in which the A-function is essential
for the specification of sepal identity, A- and B-functions for
petals, B- and C-functions determine stamen identity, and the
C-function on its own is responsible for carpel formation. In
Arabidopsis the A-function is defined by APETALA1 (AP1)
and APETALA2 (AP2), the B-function by APETALA3 (AP3)
and PISTILLATA (PI), and the C-function by AGAMOUS
(AG), from which only the AP2 gene does not belong to the
MADS box family.
Although the original 'ABC model' describes well the homeotic mutations in the various floral mutants, the lack of floral
organ formation outside the flower when B- and/or C-function MADS box genes were ectopically expressed indicated
that more factors are required for the floral organ identity
functions [5,6]. In Arabidopsis, the SEPALLATA (SEP)
MADS box genes appeared to be the missing co-factors and
this new class of floral organ identity genes was termed Efunction genes [7]. In line with the refined and extended 'ABC
model', combinatorial over-expression of A-, B- and E-function genes results in conversion of leaves into petals, whereas
constitutive expression of B-, C- and E-function genes gives
rise to the formation of stamens instead of leaves [8-10]. Like
for many MADS box genes, functional redundancy exists for
the E-function genes, and only in the sep1 sep2 sep3 triple
mutant were clear phenotypical alterations observed, namely
the conversion of the second and third whorl organs into
sepals and the development of a new inflorescence from the
central region of the floral meristem [7]. Mutation of the
fourth Arabidopsis SEP gene (SEP4) in a sep1 sep2 sep3
background resulted in the production of leaves only [11] and
reveals an important function for SEP4 in sepal development.
In addition, these latter observations give supporting evidence for Goethe's so-called 'big metamorphose', which proposes that a genetic program for the development of leaves is
the basis for the formation of the flower, implying that floral
organs can be regarded as modified leaves [12]. More detailed
analyses of double and triple sep4, cauliflower (cal), and ap1
mutants and genetic titration experiments for the sep muta-

tions demonstrated that SEP4 also has a role in establishing
floral meristem identity and petal, stamen and carpel development [11]. Furthermore, the genetic titration experiments
for the sep mutations described by Ditta and colleagues [11]
showed dosage effects and redundancy for the SEP genes.
Similar conclusions were drawn in relation to ovule development, in which the SEP genes act in a dose-dependent manner together with the C-function gene AG and the D-function
genes SEEDSTICK (STK), SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1) and
SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2) [13].
In conclusion, all these genetic data point towards a central
role for the SEP genes in floral meristem and floral organ
development. The importance of this class of genes for floral
development has been put forward from an evolutionary
point of view as well. Based on detailed phylogenetic studies
and the fact that SEP like genes have been isolated from
angiosperms only, Zahn and colleagues [14] suggested that
the SEP genes might be the basis for the origin of flowers.
An intriguing question arising from the ABC model is how all
these different MADS box transcription factors co-operate
together at the molecular level. Part of this question could be
answered based on in vitro biochemical assays [15] and yeast
two-, three- and four-hybrid experiments that were performed over the past decade (among others [8,16,17]). The
yeast experiments revealed binary interactions between specific A-, B-, C-, D-, and E-function MADS box proteins and,
furthermore, they suggest the assembly into higher-order
complexes consisting of 'ABC'-function MADS domain proteins and dimers. These results support the notion that MADS
box proteins are active in a combinatorial manner and,
accordingly, the 'Quartet model' has been proposed for MADS
box transcription factor functioning [18]. In this model, a pivotal role has been attributed to the SEP proteins (E-function),
which are present in almost all known higher-order complexes and, thus, can be regarded as the 'glue' proteins of floral organ development. Similar higher-order complexes have
been identified for MADS box proteins of other species, such
as Antirrhinum [17], chrysanthemum [19], petunia [20-23]
and tomato [24], demonstrating that these types of interactions are conserved among angiosperm species. Furthermore,
it has been shown recently that the SEP3 protein on its own is
able to form homotetramers in vitro [25]. Based on all these
findings, it is acceptable to use the 'Quartet model' as the
working model for MADS box transcription factor functioning, although hardly any evidence for direct physical higherorder complex formation between MADS proteins in plant
cells has been found. Recently, it has been shown that the
transient interaction between the petunia MADS box proteins
FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN11 (FBP11) and FBP24 in protoplasts can be stabilized by adding the FBP2 protein, suggesting that a multimeric protein complex is formed in living
plant cells [23]. Furthermore, gel filtration experiments with
native protein extracts revealed that the FLOWERING
LOCUS C (FLC) MADS box transcription factor is present in

high molecular weight complexes [26]. In conclusion, MADS
box proteins are able to multimerize in plant cells and are
present in large complexes in vivo; however, the exact composition and stoichiometry of these complexes remains
unknown.
In this study a large-scale yeast three-hybrid screen was performed to unravel the capacity and selectivity of higher-order
complex formation for Arabidopsis MADS box transcription
factors, with a special focus on the SEP proteins. In total, 106
ternary interactions were scored and in 78 cases at least one
SEP protein appeared to be involved. The obtained results
illustrate that higher-order complex formation is common
among MADS proteins, and that this mechanism is employed
by all subfamilies of the MADS box family. Based on available
expression data for the MADS box genes that code for the
interacting proteins, previous mutant analyses, and interaction studies in living plant cells, biological functions could be
proposed for particular SEP3 complexes.

Results
Large scale yeast three-hybrid analysis
After the discovery that A. majus MADS box proteins are able
to form multimeric complexes in yeast [17], a small number of
additional ternary and quaternary complexes has been identified for MADS box proteins from various species. Currently,
approximately 20 potential higher-order complexes involving
Arabidopsis MADS box proteins have been reported
[8,13,20,27] (Table S1 in Additional data file 1). Remarkably,
the vast majority of these complexes contains the SEP3 protein, which suggests that proteins of this sub-clade are important mediators of higher-order complex formation.
To get a better understanding about the capacity and specificity of complex formation for Arabidopsis MADS box proteins in general, and for the SEP3 protein in particular, a large
scale yeast three-hybrid screening was performed. For this
purpose all MADS box protein dimers that were identified in
the comprehensive yeast two-hybrid screening [16] were
reconstituted in yeast strain PJ69-4 mating type A (Table S2
in Additional data file 1) by expressing one of the two dimerization partners as a fusion with the activation domain (AD) of
the yeast GAL4 transcription factor, while the other protein
was fused to a nuclear localization signal only [28]. Subsequently, these yeast clones were screened against the available collection of single MADS box proteins fused to the GAL4
binding domain (BD) in yeast strain PJ69-4 mating type
Alpha [16].
In total, 27,400 combinations (274 dimers × 100 single proteins) were tested for ternary complex formation and this
screen yielded 47 positives (Table S3 in Additional data file 1).
The results reveal a preference for ternary complex formation
with proteins of the same sub-class of MADS box proteins; in
general, type II proteins interact with other type II proteins

Volume 10, Issue 2, Article R24

Immink et al. R24.3

and the same holds for members of the type I sub-class.
Besides the 47 higher-order complexes that were identified in
this screen, nine additional dimers were found that were
missed in the large-scale yeast two-hybrid screening performed by De Folter and colleagues [16] (Table S4 in Additional data file 1). Most likely, this difference is caused by the
more mild selection criteria used for the yeast three-hybrid
experiments. Although, many new triple combinations were
found, the total number of ternary interactions was much
lower than expected and, to our surprise, none of the known
complexes was identified. The latter discrepancy could be
explained to a large extent by technical limitations of the system: many combinations could not be tested for ternary complex formation, because the two proteins that were fused to
GAL4-AD and -BD were already able to form a dimer that
activated the yeast reporter genes even without the incorporation of the third protein in the complex. For instance, we
could not observe the interaction between SEP3, STK (dimer
257 in Table S2 in Additional data file 1) and AG [13], because
GAL4-AD-SEP3 and GAL4-BD-AG are able to dimerize and
activate the yeast reporter [16]. Furthermore, the presence of
an intrinsic transcriptional AD in about 20% of the Arabidopsis MADS box proteins [16], including the SEP1 and SEP3
proteins [10], limited drastically the number of combinations
that could be tested for ternary interactions due to auto-activation of the yeast reporters.

SEP3 ternary complex formation
One of the main goals of the large-scale yeast three-hybrid
screening was to obtain a comprehensive picture of the potential of SEP proteins to mediate higher-order complex formation. However, this objective was hampered by the large
number of dimers formed by these proteins and auto-activation of the yeast reporters by the SEP proteins. To overcome
the latter problem we mapped the auto-activation domain in
the SEP3 protein in order to remove this domain from the
protein. This SEP member was chosen because genetic studies [7,11], transactivation assays [10], and yeast two-hybrid
experiments [16] have revealed that SEP3 is the most 'active'
member of the SEP clade. To predict the presence of potential
transcriptional activation domains, a search for motifs was
performed with the software program DILIMOT on the fulllength sequences of all MADS box proteins that gave autoactivation in yeast [16]. In this screen, a total of ten motifs was
found, including the ones that were identified for the AP1 protein previously [29], and almost all appeared to be located in
the carboxy-terminal region of the MADS box proteins (Table
S5 in Additional data file 1). This observation supports results
from previous studies, where transcriptional activation
capacity was often detected in the carboxy-terminal domain
of plant MADS box proteins [10,21,29,30]. Subsequent analyses revealed that the identified motifs are underrepresented
in the sequences of MADS box proteins that do not give autoactivation in yeast. Based on this, a decision tree model could
be designed using those motifs that discriminate between
auto-activating and non-auto-activating MADS box

sequences, providing additional evidence for their role in
transcriptional activation (Table S5 in Additional data file 1).
As control, DILIMOT was used again to search for eventual
overrepresented motifs in the set of MADS box proteins that
do not give auto-activation in yeast. This search did not reveal
any motif, consistent with their lack of transcriptional activation. When using the predicted auto-activation motifs to scan
all proteins from the Arabidopsis genome, we found that
these motifs are over two-fold overrepresented in transcription factors compared to all proteins, and that this overrepresentation is even higher (over four-fold) when analyzing
proteins with at least two of the motifs present (Table S5 in
Additional data file 1). This result provides additional validation for the putative role of the motifs in transcription activation. Note that one does not expect all transcription factors to
be auto-activating, and, in addition, not all auto-activating
transcription factors need to contain the same motifs.
Figure 1 illustrates the putative transcriptional activation
motifs in the SEP3 protein sequence. Previous studies have
demonstrated that besides transcriptional activation capacity, ternary interaction determinants are also localized in the
carboxy-terminal region of MADS box proteins [17], and,
therefore, it was important to take this characteristic into
account as well. Yang and Jack [31] performed an in-depth
mapping of the domains involved in ternary complex formation between the B-function proteins and SEP3, and this
study assigned an important role to the last predicted
amphipathic alpha-helical structure at the border between
the K-box and the carboxy-terminal region (Figure 1). Stimulated by these results, we used the web-based programs Paircoil [32] and Multicoil [33] to predict alpha-helical structures

within the SEP3 protein. Based on these predictions and the
identified putative activation domains, we designed two truncated SEP3 proteins lacking 80 and 67 amino acid residues at
the carboxyl terminus, and named SEP3C1 and SEP3C2,
respectively (Figure 1). The first truncated protein stops
within the last predicted alpha helix, while the SEP3C2 protein terminates directly after this predicted structural
domain. Subsequently, the shortened proteins were fused to
GAL4-BD and tested in yeast for auto-activation capacity,
which appeared to be abolished in both cases. To investigate
the ability of the two truncated SEP3 versions to form dimers
and higher-order complexes, the previously identified heterodimer between AG and SEP3 [16] and the ternary complex
between AG, STK and SEP3 [13] were tested in yeast. As
expected, both SEP3C protein versions were still able to
dimerize with AG; however, only SEP3C2 interacted with
AG and STK in the yeast three-hybrid experiment, demonstrating once more the importance of the predicted alpha-helical structure at the end of the K-box for ternary protein
interactions (helix III in Figure 1). Based on these observations, we reconstituted all known SEP3 dimers in yeast making use of the SEP3C2 construct (Table S6 in Additional data
file 1). This new collection of dimers was screened against all
single MADS box proteins in a yeast three-hybrid assay, and
reciprocally, the single SEP3C2 protein fused to GAL4-BD
was combined with the set of MADS domain dimers (Table S2
in Additional data file 1). This experiment yielded 59 additional higher-order complexes (Table S7 in Additional data
file 1), including the known SEP3 ternary interactions (Table
S1 in Additional data file 1). Figure 2a shows the sub-network
representing all SEP3 interactions, whereas the overall net-

work, including the complexes listed in Table S3 in Additional
data file 1, is depicted in Figure 2b.

SEP3 complex partners are co-expressed
A prerequisite for a biologically relevant protein-protein
interaction in planta is coexistence of the proteins in the same
cell and at the same moment during development. Therefore,
the expression patterns of the genes encoding complex-forming MADS box proteins were compared using AtGenExpress
data [34]. Note that a few MADS box genes are not presented
on the ATH1 arrays used for AtGenExpress. For these particular MADS box genes, the AtTAX data were analyzed. This
data set represent the results from whole genome tiling array
hybridizations [35]. Unfortunately, no expression above
background levels could be detected for most of the MADS
box genes missing from the ATH1 arrays in the limited
number of tissues tested on the tiling arrays. As a consequence, co-expression could not be confirmed for 16 out of
the 106 identified complexes. Except for one complex, these
are all complexes involving type I MADS box proteins, which
are hardly studied. The co-expression analysis revealed that
for almost 100% of the identified complexes containing type
II MADS box proteins, the encoding genes have an overlap in
expression in at least one tissue (Tables S3 and S7 in Additional data file 1). Remarkably, for type I proteins this was
only 78%. This may reflect a real lack of co-expression, but,
more likely, this is due to the low and very localized expression of a number of type I proteins [2,3,36-40], which makes
the microarray data less reliable. For the few identified complexes consisting of combinations of type I and type II proteins, the expression patterns of the encoding genes appeared
to overlap. The high percentage of co-expression (overall
95%) indicates that almost all identified complexes could
potentially be formed in planta, although, for some of the
genes, the expression levels were very low in the overlapping
tissues. We also realize that these data are mRNA expression
data and do not reflect protein levels; however, as far as is
known, the spatial and temporal distribution of MADS
domain proteins follows roughly the mRNA expression patterns [41,42]. Nevertheless, we can not exclude that non-cell
autonomous action of MADS proteins plays a role and that
some proteins are transported to adjacent cell layers and tissues. This has been shown, for instance, for the B-function
MADS box proteins from Antirrhinum [43]. In Figure S1 in
Additional data file 1 a comparison of expression patterns is
presented for all gene combinations encoding putative ternary complex components for the complexes that contain the
SEP3 protein.

SEP3, AP3, and PI complex formation in living plant
cells
To our surprise, a ternary complex was found in yeast
between AP3, PI and SEP3, making use of full-length B-function proteins (Table S7 in Additional data file 1). Previous
experiments revealed that the supposed heterodimer
between AP3 and PI could not be detected in the yeast two-

hybrid system when full-length proteins were used [16,44].
This strongly suggests that SEP3 can mediate the interaction
between AP3 and PI in yeast. To investigate the behavior of
these proteins in plant cells in more detail, we analyzed their
interactions by fluorescence resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FRET-FLIM) in Arabidopsis leaf cells [23,45,46]. Initially, AP3, PI and SEP3 were
carboxy-terminally labeled by enhanced cyan fluorescent
protein (CFP) or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
and transiently expressed in protoplasts, followed by confocal
laser scanning microscopy for the analysis of their intracellular localization. Surprisingly, besides SEP3, PI was also
nuclear localized, whereas the AP3 protein was found in both
the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 3a-c). These localization
results are not in agreement with previous intracellular localization data obtained for AP3 and PI in studies by McGonigle
and colleagues [47], who observed that nuclear localization of
the two B-function proteins occurs only when both proteins
are simultaneously expressed. However, in their case, the
GUS reporter was used and amino-terminally fused to the
MADS box protein, followed by expression in onion epidermal cells, which might be the reason for the observed differences. It has been shown before that fusion of green
fluorescent protein-like fluorophores to the amino terminus
of MADS box proteins can influence their nuclear import
[23,48]. To analyze whether there is a difference between
amino- and carboxy-terminal labeling with respect to localization, AP3 and PI were also labeled with YFP at the amino
terminus and transfected into protoplasts. In accordance with
the results reported in the literature [47], most of the signal
appeared to be localized in the cytoplasm in this case (Figure
3d); however, co-expression of the other B-function protein
labeled at the carboxy-terminal results in a mainly nuclear
localized signal for both proteins (Figure 3e) and the same
result was obtained when both proteins were carboxy-terminally labeled (Figure 3f). Based on these observations, we
decided to make use of carboxy-terminal fusions for all further experiments.
FRET-FLIM was used to investigate the physical interaction
of the labeled proteins in the leaf cells. The homodimer combinations 'SEP3-CFP + SEP3-YFP', 'PI-CFP + PI-YFP' and
'AP3-CFP + AP3-YFP' were analyzed first and 'PI-YFP + free
CFP' was used as a negative control (Figure 4). Interestingly,
a remarkable difference was detected among the proteins
analyzed for homodimerization capacity. In the case of SEP3,
a strong reduction of the fluorescence lifetime was observed
over the entire nucleus, suggesting efficient homodimer formation (Figure 4b). In contrast, AP3 and PI showed only a
strong reduction of fluorescence lifetime in particular subnuclear spots, which may represent more transient interactions (Figure 4c,d). Interaction in parts of the nucleus has
been reported before for petunia MADS box proteins [23].
Currently, it is unclear whether these non-homogeneous
interactions are biologically relevant; however, the ability of
B-function proteins to homodimerize is supposed to be the

ancestral status, which subsequently evolved into obligatory
heterodimerization in the core eudicots [49]. In line with this,
it could be that the homodimer interactions identified for the
individual Arabidopsis B-function proteins by FRET-FLIM
are remnants of their former ability to homodimerize, which
has been almost lost during evolution. In a following experiment, we tested the supposed heterodimerization between
the full-length PI and AP3 proteins in plant cells. Because no
interaction was found between these two full-length proteins
in yeast, the heterodimer between AP1 and SEP3 was added
as a positive control [16]. As expected, the AP1-SEP3 combination showed a very strong reduction in fluorescence lifetime over the entire nucleus (Figure 4e). Interestingly, the
combination AP3-PI also showed a strong FRET-FLIM signal
demonstrated by a short fluorescence lifetime, suggesting
that these proteins are able to form heterodimers in living
plant cells (Figure 4f). Remarkably, this combination always
resulted in a strong accumulation of fluorescent signal in a
ring-like pattern at the position of the nucleolus (Figures 3f
and 4f), a phenomenon that was never observed for any other
combination of MADS box proteins tested.
Subsequently, the effect of SEP3 on the AP3-PI heterodimer
was analyzed by FRET-FLIM to gain insight into higher-order
complex formation. For this purpose the occurrence of FRET

was measured between PI-CFP and AP3-YFP in the presence
of a non-labeled SEP3 protein. The addition of SEP3
appeared to have a strong effect on the localization of the PI
and AP3 proteins: instead of localization at the nucleolus
(Figure 4f), the AP3 and PI protein interaction appeared to be
more equally distributed over the nucleus in the presence of
SEP3 (Figure 4g). Furthermore, a short fluorescence lifetime
could be observed over the entire nucleus, although the drop
in fluorescence lifetime was less strong than in the absence of
SEP3 (Figure 4f). An explanation for this could be that SEP3,
which is supposed to bind to the carboxy-terminal regions of
AP3 and PI, interferes with the optimal positioning of CFP
and YFP for a high FRET efficiency.

Discussion
Plant MADS domain protein higher-order complex
formation
MADS box transcription factors play essential roles during
the plant lifecycle and can be characterized as the architects
of plant development. Their specific functioning is mainly
determined by direct physical protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions (reviewed in [45,50]). Besides the formation
of dimers, the well studied type II floral organ identity MADS
box proteins [51] are supposed to form multimeric protein
complexes consisting of three to four different MADS box
proteins (for example, [8,17,21]). Remarkably, the majority of
higher-order complexes known to date contains at least one
protein belonging to the 'E-function' class, which is represented by the SEP proteins in Arabidopsis [7]. It was
unknown whether assembly into these large complexes is a
common molecular mechanism that mediates plant MADS
box transcription factor functioning, or whether this is only
characteristic for the 'ABC-function' proteins and, in particular, for 'E-function' proteins. Therefore, we performed a
large-scale yeast three-hybrid analysis for members of the
Arabidopsis MADS box transcription factor family. Although
this study was not comprehensive due to technical limitations
of the screen, many novel complexes could be identified for
both type I and type II MADS box transcription factors. In the
initial screen with the full-length proteins, more complexes
were identified that exclusively consist of type II proteins (25)
than complexes with only type I proteins (15), while the Arabidopsis genome encodes more proteins belonging to the latter class. Whether this difference in the capacity to assemble
into multimeric complexes between these two groups is due
to differences in protein structure and reflects their biological
functions needs more thorough investigations by alternative

methods. The fact that type I proteins lack a K-box, which has
been shown to be an important mediator for dimerization and
higher-order complex formation [31,44], could explain the
observed differences. Nevertheless, coiled-coil structures
have been predicted within the carboxy-terminal region of
type I proteins [2] and these structural motifs are well-known
molecular recognition structures [52] that potentially can be
involved in type I complex formation.
In the previous two-hybrid screen from De Folter and colleagues [16], interactions between type I and type II MADS
box proteins were observed, although rare. In the current
three-hybrid screen also only a few complexes (7) were found
that contain both type I and type II proteins, though the genes
encoding these interacting proteins are co-expressed (Table
S3 in Additional data file 1). The presence of these interactions suggests that they arose before the duplication that gave
rise to the two lineages, which happened before the divergence of plants and animals [51]. Alternatively but less likely,
these hybrid interactions were acquired after the birth of the
type I and II MADS box lineages. Interestingly, the interaction networks of the type I and type II proteins are clearly separated (Figure 2b), which may reflect the different functions
these proteins play in plants. Most type II proteins are
involved in identity specification and phase changes, while
recent studies on type I genes [2,3,36-40] support the notion
that they play an important role in gametophyte and embryo
development. The inter-lineage interactions between the type
I and II sub-networks may link the different roles these
MADS box proteins play. In this respect it is interesting to
notice that five out of seven 'type I-type II' interactions contain either the type II proteins ARABIDOPSIS BSISTER
(ABS) or AG; both proteins are important for gametophyte
and seed development in Arabidopsis [20,27,53]. The ABS
gene encodes two proteins, ABS-I and ABS-II, which are
derived through alternative splicing [20]. The yeast threehybrid experiments revealed that both proteins multimerize
with type I proteins, but with a difference in specificity.
Besides these differences, novel and distinctive interactions
with type II proteins were also found for the two ABS proteins, which had not been identified in previous studies
[20,27]. These differences in interaction specificity probably
explain the observation that only the long splice form (ABS-I)
can complement the endothelium defects in the abs mutant
[20]. In contrast to ABS-II, the ABS-I protein is able to form
a ternary complex with AGAMOUS-LIKE16 (AGL16)-SEP3,
PI-SEP3, AGL74N-SEP2 and SEP1-SEP2. Except for
'AGL74N-SEP2-ABS-I', co-expression of the genes encoding
these interacting proteins in carpels and young pistils containing seeds has been detected [34]. Unfortunately, detailed
information about expression in the ovule and function of
these ABS-I specific interaction partners is missing, leaving
the question of whether one of these novel complexes is
responsible for the functional discrepancy between ABS-I and
ABS-II unanswered.

Expression of the genes encoding complex members
In general, co-expression of genes encoding interaction partners may give clues about a common function for the proteins
involved. For example, members of the MIKC* sub-clade
(also known as M [2]) are specifically expressed during pollen formation and the encoded proteins form higher-order
complexes with other members of this sub-clade, suggesting
that they play an important role during pollen development
[54]. However, a lack of a large expression overlap in planta
does not necessarily mean that we are dealing with a false
positive protein interaction. Note that, for example, the AGSEP3 dimer interacts with a set of ternary interacting factors
that overlap in expression pattern with the dimerization partners in distinct tissues, or during particular stages of development only (Tables S3 and S7 and Figure S1 in Additional data
file 1). Complexes were also identified for proteins that show
no obvious overlap in their corresponding mRNA expression
patterns, as, for example, complexes consisting of the floral
activators AGL24 [55], SUPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION
OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) [56], and the AGL17 or AGL19 proteins, which are both encoded by genes preferentially
expressed in roots [57,58]. However, recent functional analyses of AGL17 [59] and AGL19 [58] revealed that these proteins are also inducers of flowering and share this function
with their putative complex partners. Besides the expression
in roots, both AGL17 and AGL19 show low expression in
above-ground vegetative parts [58,59], which probably
results in sufficient molecules for complex formation and
subsequent activation of flowering in the shoot apical meristem. Furthermore, it is known that the expression levels of
AGL24 [60], SOC1 [61], and AGL17 [59] are coordinately upregulated by CONSTANS (CO) and, hence, that these MADS
box genes act downstream of this protein in the photoperiodic
flowering pathway. Based on all these findings, we hypothesize that the specific higher-order complex formation
between these MADS box proteins is an important mechanism for the functioning of these proteins in the regulation of
flowering time. Notably, similar kinds of complexes have
been found for a couple of other related and preferentially
root-expressed MADS box proteins (AGL14, AGL21 and
AGL42) [57,62,63], whose functions are unknown. From the
genes encoding these proteins, AGL42 is strongly up-regulated upon a switch from short day to long day conditions, as
is the case for SOC1 and AGL24 [64]. Based on the common
complex formation partners identified in this study, we may
speculate that the AGL42 protein also plays a role in floral
induction.

The importance of SEP proteins for multimerization
SEP proteins seem to be important mediators of higher-order
complex formation and, therefore, we have focused on the
capacity of the SEP3 protein to form multimeric complexes.
In the dedicated yeast three-hybrid screen with the carboxyterminally truncated SEP3 protein, known SEP3 ternary
complexes were confirmed, showing that the conditions of
our yeast three-hybrid assay permit the detection of these ter-

nary interactions. To our surprise, the screen with the truncated SEP3 protein more than doubled the total number of
identified ternary MADS box protein complexes. Despite the
fact that the number of ternary interactions found in this
study resembles most likely only a small proportion of the
potential higher-order complexes present in Arabidopsis,
this result reveals an important role for SEP3 in MADS box
protein complex formation. Therefore, the SEP3 protein can
be regarded as a 'glue' that mediates the assembly of MADS
box transcription factor complexes and is functional as a hub
in the MADS box transcription factor interaction network.
We may hypothesize that the other SEP proteins have a similar specificity for higher-order complex formation, knowing
that there is functional redundancy within this clade of MADS
box proteins [7,11]. In line with this idea, the comprehensive
yeast two-hybrid screening performed by us showed similar
binary interactions for SEP1 and SEP3 [16]. However, SEP2
and SEP4-I/II seem to have a number of different dimerization partners in yeast; also in the yeast three-hybrid screen
presented in this report, specific complexes were identified
for SEP2 and SEP4-II that could not be found for SEP3.
Together, this suggests that the functional redundancy
present in the Arabidopsis SEP clade is not complete and,
hence, that some of the SEP proteins have gained or maintained specific interactions and functions that are not shared
by the other members of the family. A similar comprehensive
approach as followed in this study for SEP3, consisting of

SEP3 ternary complexes that, based on expression patterns of the genes
encoding the involved proteins, might be formed in the shoot apical
meristem (SAM) at the moment of the phase switch between vegetative
and generative development. Taking into account known functions for
some of these proteins, the complexes have been categorized in two
classes; one for complexes supposed to be involved in regulating the
timing of flowering, and one for complexes that might function in negative
auto-regulatory loops. Our hypothesis is that complexes from this latter
group are essential for the repression of the genes involved in timing of
flowering in the floral organs.

mapping the auto-activation domain and performing the
three-hybrid screen with mutated or truncated clones, would
be needed for each individual SEP protein to elucidate their
specific ternary complex formation capacities. Regardless of
the outcome of such an experiment, however, it is clear from
the genetic studies that besides small differences, there is
overlap between the functions of the SEP proteins in the inner
three whorls of the flower, which means that the different SEP
proteins should have the capacity to form complexes with at
least some common MADS box partners. Assuming that SEP3
is the 'glue' for higher-order complex formation in the inner
three floral whorls, the question arises as to which SEP protein functions as 'glue' during the vegetative stage of development. SEP4 is expressed early during development in the
green parts of the plant, in contrast to SEP3 [34], though at
relatively low levels. Because of this, it may also be possible
that another type II MADS box protein is functional as a 'glue'
protein during the vegetative stage. In this respect, SOC1 is a
good candidate, because it has the right spatial expression
pattern and a large number of two-hybrid interaction partners like the SEP proteins. It functions as a hub in the twohybrid network [16] and, more importantly, this protein is
incorporated in ternary complexes almost as frequently as
SEP3 (Tables S3 and S7 in Additional data file 1).

Biological functions of ternary SEP3 MADS box protein
complexes
Studies performed previously revealed the importance of SEP
proteins present in ternary and quaternary floral organ identity complexes [8,9] and recent in planta protein localization
studies showed co-localization of the 'ABC' proteins in
accordance with the 'ABC model' [42]. Besides these interactions with other ABC-function MADS box proteins, our
results have shown that the SEP3 protein is potentially incorporated in complexes with MADS box proteins involved in the
regulation of flowering time, such as SOC1 [56], AGL24 [55],
SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) [65], and AGL15 [66]
(Figure 5). These interactions suggest that the SEP3 protein
also functions in the transition to flowering, which is in line
with observations in a study by Pelaz and colleagues [67], who
obtained an enhanced early flowering phenotype for Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing both AP1 and SEP3 when
compared to plants over-expressing AP1 alone. Expression of
the SEP3 protein could not be detected in vegetative tissues;
however, the protein is present at low levels in the inflorescence meristem [42]. SEP3 probably performs this early function redundantly with SEP4, which, in contrast to SEP3, is
expressed during the vegetative stage of development and is

also able to form a couple of ternary complexes with the flowering time MADS box proteins. In addition or alternatively,
ternary complexes consisting of MADS box proteins involved
in regulation of flowering time and floral organ identity proteins (for example, SEP3, AG, AP1) could function in negative
auto-regulatory feed-back mechanisms (Figure 5). De Folter
and colleagues [16] hypothesized that the expression of genes
encoding floral inducing MADS box proteins is down-regulated in the floral organ primordia by a negative auto-regulatory loop involving dimerization of the encoded proteins with
the MADS box proteins functioning in floral organ development [16]. Recently, the research group of Yu showed that the
floral meristem identity protein AP1 is involved in the downregulation of the flowering time genes SOC1, SVP and AGL24
[68]. Based on our results, it is tempting to speculate that
down-regulation of these flowering time genes is mediated by
a negative feed-back loop, in which both the flowering proteins and SEP3 are involved (Figure 5). In line with this, in
situ hybridization analyses for flowering time genes in wildtype plants show hardly any signal during later stages of
flower development [68,69]. However, in mutant backgrounds of floral organ identity MADS box genes, such as ap1,
ag, and sep1/sep2/sep3, ectopic expression of these flowering
time genes is obtained in floral tissues [68,69]. Although this
gives strong evidence for the supposed negative auto-regulatory loops, further studies are required to support the hypothesis that higher-order complexes are essential for this
function.
It is difficult to assign a biological role for some of the other
ternary SEP3 complexes identified in our study because no
information is available about the functions of the individual
proteins. Furthermore, many proteins may have multiple
functions throughout the life cycle of a plant and, therefore,
late functions can be masked by early functions in genetic
studies. The expression of MADS box genes late during development of the floral organs [42] and the late functions identified for, for example, B-function MADS box proteins [70,71]
and AG [72] demonstrate that these transcription factors are
multi-tasking and play a role during further differentiation of
the floral organs. These various functions are reflected in the
different complexes formed by such a MADS box protein,
each supposed to regulate a specific set of target genes. SEP3
is part of many complexes and, therefore, may bind to different target genes controlling distinct developmental pathways.
Because the sep1 sep2 sep3 triple mutant produces only
sepals in the flower [7], it is difficult to predict SEP3 functions
at later flowering stages, but, based on its expression pattern
and our interaction data, we could assign a role for this protein as a key regulator in many developmental processes (Figure 6). For instance, the protein complex consisting of SEP3,
STK and AG is involved in ovule identity specification [13],
while a combination with the integument and seed coat-specific protein ABS may be required for the subsequent steps in
seed development [20].

Immink et al. R24.11

Molecular function of SEP3 in ternary MADS box
protein complexes
As shown by yeast-based and FRET-FLIM studies, the ternary factor SEP3 is able to stabilize dimeric interactions and
to affect the subcellular localization of its interaction partners. Stabilization of a MADS box transcription factor dimer
by a ternary factor has been shown in petunia before [23] and
may be a general function for ternary MADS box factors. The
effect of SEP3 on AP3-PI localization could play an important
role in the temporal storage or, alternatively, in the activation
of this specific MADS box protein dimer. Recently, it has been
shown that the mammalian basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hand1 is sequestered in the nucleolus due to interaction with a co-factor, and that the release of this protein
from the nucleolus is essential for its activation [73]. Similar
mechanisms may play a role in activating particular plant
MADS box proteins, such as AP3 and PI. The question
remains if this is the only function for ternary factors, like
SEP3, in higher-order complexes. SEP3 appears to contain a
strong transcription activation domain and, based on this, it
has been hypothesized that an important function of this ternary factor is to add transcriptional activity to multimeric
transcription factor complexes [10]. This might be true, but,
at least in the case of the complex AP3-PI-SEP3, the SEP3
protein is doing more, because plants with constitutive overexpression of AP3 and PI fused to the VP16 trans-activation
domain do not show homeotic changes of cauline leaves into
floral organs (K Goto, personal communication). In contrast,
the constitutive expression of AP3 and PI in combination with
SEP3 gives conversions of cauline leaves into petals [8,9].
Although the combination of constitutive AP3 and PI-VP16
expression is sufficient to activate the positive auto-regulatory loop for the B-function MADS box genes - that is, it activates the AP3 promoter [10] - it is not sufficient for the
regulation of all AP3-PI target genes that are essential for
petal development. In conclusion, SEP3 can change the subnuclear localization of the AP3-PI heterodimer and probably
this is crucial for petal development. Furthermore, Egea-Cortines and colleagues [17] have shown that ternary complexes
bind more strongly to the consensus CArG-box in DNA
sequences than MADS box protein dimers. SEP3 in a multimeric complex may facilitate the protein-DNA interaction,
either by stabilizing the dimer or by direct binding to the DNA
and providing specificity. In the latter case, the DNA will bend
and the transcription complex will bind to two binding sites at
a short distance from each other. In addition, ternary complex formation may play a role in the recruitment of co-factors. Recent studies have shown that the MADS box proteins
AGL24 and SVP are not able to interact with the LEUNIGSEUSS co-repressor complex, although interaction between
these proteins could be mediated by the AP1 protein [74]. In
a similar way, SEP3 enables the interaction between MADS
box proteins involved in ovule development (for example,
STK) and the BELL1 homeodomain factor [75].

Figure function of SEP3 complexes during plant development

Putative function of SEP3 complexes during plant development. Some of the identified higher-order SEP3 complexes have been placed in the Arabidopsis life
cycle at the stage in which they are supposed to be functional. For all the indicated complexes the genes encoding the proteins are co-expressed in a
particular tissue or developmental stage (Tables S3 and S7 and Figure S1 in Additional data file 1). Note, that the graphical representation probably does
not reflect the real stoichiometry of the complexes. It is possible, for example, that proteins are present as homodimers in the complexes.

Conclusions

This study yielded a collection of potential multimeric MADS
domain protein complexes in which SEP3, the 'glue protein',
plays a central role. Besides the initial steps of floral organ

formation, this protein seems to function in various other
plant developmental processes via multimerization (Figures 5
and 6). Higher-order complex formation of MADS domain
proteins appears to be a common process and provides these

transcription factors with unique attributes to function in a
specific manner, such as the possibility to change interaction
stability, localization of the proteins, and their DNA binding
specificity. Combining protein interaction analyses as performed in this study and co-expression analyses provides
complementary functional information about MADS transcription factors, in particular when mutant phenotypes are
missing due to redundancy or when the proteins are involved
in multiple developmental processes, as is the case for SEP3.

Materials and methods
Plant material
Protoplasts were obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0
leaves, which were grown under normal greenhouse conditions (16/8 h light/dark, 22°C), according to Aker and colleagues [76].

Plasmid constructions
For the yeast three-hybrid experiments two new SEP3 Gateway entry clones were generated, encoding the carboxy-terminally truncated versions of this protein. The first clone,
designated SEP3C1, encodes SEP3 lacking the last 80 amino
acids of the carboxyl terminus and the second clone,
SEP3C2, encodes the SEP3 protein lacking 67 amino acids
at its carboxyl end. The truncated coding regions were
obtained by PCR and a new stop codon was included in the
reverse primer. Subsequently, the PCR fragments were
cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), followed by sub-cloning via a Gateway LR reaction into
pBDGAL4 (pDEST32; Invitrogen) and the Gateway compatible pTFT1 yeast expression vector (pARC352) [28]. For the in
vivo localization and interaction studies, the coding region of
the MADS box genes APETALA1 (AP1), APETALA3 (AP3),
PISTILLATA (PI), AGAMOUS (AG), SEP3 and SEP3C1,
were cloned as Gateway entry clones without stop codons
(pCR8/GW/TOPO; Invitrogen), in order to allow carboxyterminal fusions. The obtained entry clones were recombined
into the Gateway compatible destination vectors pARC971
and pARC428 from which expression is driven by the constitutive CaMV35S promoter and that contain the coding
regions of the fluorophores CFP and YFP, respectively [23].
Furthermore, amino-terminal fusions were made for AP3 and
PI. In this case, the destination vector was pK7WGY2,0 from
the VIB collection [77], containing the coding region of the
YFP molecule. AP3 and PI entry clones including stop codons
were taken from the REGIA collection [2,16]. All plasmids
were controlled by sequence analyses (DETT sequence kit;
Amersham, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Yeast three-hybrid screen
Transformations of yeast strain PJ69-4, mating type A and 
[78], were done as described by the laboratory of Gietz [79].
Triple combinations of MADS box proteins in yeast were
obtained by robotized mating between individual mat yeast
cultures containing 'pBD-GAL4-MADS' vectors [16] and

Volume 10, Issue 2, Article R24

Immink et al. R24.13

matA yeast cultures containing the MADS dimers (Tables S2
and S6 in Additional data file 1), following the protocol
described before [16]. The mated yeast was grown for 2 days
at 30°C on plates with synthetic dropout medium without leucine (L), tryptophan (W) and adenine (A), to select for the
presence of all three plasmids. Subsequently, some yeast
material was resuspended in 50 l sterile water, in a 96-well
micro-titer plate. Aliquots (5 l) of these suspensions were
spotted onto synthetic dropout medium plates lacking the
amino acids L, W, A and histidine (H) and supplemented with
1 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) in a grid of 96 spots, to
select for protein interactions. These plates were incubated at
20°C for 7 days before scoring of yeast growth. All positives
due to dimerization between two of the three proteins, and/or
auto-activation by the MADS box protein expressed from the
pBD-GAL4 vector, or its dimerization partner in the
pARC352 vector, were discarded based on our knowledge
from the large-scale yeast two-hybrid experiment [16]. For all
remaining positive combinations the mating was repeated
and the interaction confirmed by spotting onto plates with
synthetic dropout medium lacking amino acids L, W, A, H
and supplemented with 1, 5, or 10 mM 3-AT. In parallel, a
LacZ assay [80] was performed to test for the activation of
this second reporter gene. All combinations that were scored
at least two times positive and for both the HIS and LacZ
selection markers, were selected as true positives.

Fluorescence microscopy in living cells
Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were transfected as described by
Aker and colleagues [76]. Plasmid DNA (15-30 g) was used
and the protoplasts were incubated overnight at 25°C before
imaging. Images were made using a confocal laser microscope 510 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The Argon laser was
used to excite at 458 and 514 nm for CFP and YFP, respectively. Fluorescence was detected through a band pass filter of
470-500 nm for CFP and 535-590 nm for YFP [76].

FRET-FLIM measurements in living cells
FRET-FLIM analyses were done in Arabidopsis protoplasts
as described before [23,81]. The donor fluorescence lifetime
was measured on the central part of the nucleus of each single
cell, pixel by pixel, and at least ten cells were analyzed per
combination in three independent experiments. The donor
lifetime of CFP was fixed at 2.6 ns for all further analyses.
Images were acquired by using the Becker and Hickl 1 SPC
830 module, and SPC image 2.8 software was used for the
data analyses (Becker and Hickl, Berlin, Germany).

Prediction of transcriptional activation
DILIMOT [82] was applied using default parameters (maximum motif length 8, number of fixed positions 3, minimal
number of motifs in dataset 3) on all 19 sequences of MADS
box proteins showing auto-activation in yeast [16]. Subsequently, using ps_scan [82], it was confirmed that these
motifs occur much less often in other MADS box protein
sequences. To obtain further insight into the role of these

motifs, a decision tree model was built (using the function
'tree' in the software package R) with class indicator 'autoactivation' or 'no auto-activation' and variables describing
occurrence of each motif in the sequences. This analysis
selected five motifs out of the ten motifs returned by
DILIMOT (Table S5 in Additional data file 1) and resulted in
a model with over 80% accuracy, 80% specificity and 50%
coverage. The accuracy is the overall percentage of correct
predictions and the specificity indicates the percentage of
predicted auto-activating proteins for which auto-activation
was identified in yeast. The coverage gives the percentage of
experimentally detected auto-activating proteins that were
also predicted to give auto-activation.

Arabidopsis MADS domain proteins reported in the literature. Table S2 provides an overview of all MADS domain protein dimers that have been generated in yeast. Table S3
presents the higher-order complexes that were identified in
the initial yeast three-hybrid screening. Table S4 lists the few
dimers that could be extracted from the dataset in Additional
file 3 and that were not identified before in the comprehensive two-hybrid screening [16]. Table S5 gives information
about the prediction of transcription activation domains in
the MADS protein sequences. Table S6 lists the yeast collection containing all SEP3C2 dimers. Table S7 lists all ternary
complexes that were identified using this SEP3C2 collection. Figure S1 shows the data of the co-expression analysis
for genes encoding interacting MADS domain proteins.

The developmental set of the AtGenExpress expression atlas
[34] was analyzed for expression of MADS box genes, as previously described [16]. A threshold of log2  4 was applied to
identify overlap in tissues with expression of genes. For genes
not expressed in the AtGenExpress expression atlas (AGL13,
AGL61, AGL92, AGL96, and AGL103) other publicly available
expression data were used [2,35,83].
