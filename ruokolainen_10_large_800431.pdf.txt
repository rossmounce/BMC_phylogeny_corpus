Abstract
Background: The ornamental plant Gerbera hybrida bears complex inflorescences with morphologically distinct floral
morphs that are specific to the sunflower family Asteraceae. We have previously characterized several MADS box genes
that regulate floral development in Gerbera. To study further their behavior in higher order complex formation
according to the quartet model, we performed yeast two- and three-hybrid analysis with fourteen Gerbera MADS
domain proteins to analyze their protein-protein interaction potential.
Results: The exhaustive pairwise interaction analysis showed significant differences in the interaction capacity of
different Gerbera MADS domain proteins compared to other model plants. Of particular interest in these assays was
the behavior of SEP-like proteins, known as GRCDs in Gerbera. The previously described GRCD1 and GRCD2 proteins,
which are specific regulators involved in stamen and carpel development, respectively, showed very limited pairwise
interactions, whereas the related GRCD4 and GRCD5 factors displayed hub-like positions in the interaction map. We
propose GRCD4 and GRCD5 to provide a redundant and general E function in Gerbera, comparable to the SEP proteins
in Arabidopsis. Based on the pairwise interaction data, combinations of MADS domain proteins were further subjected
to yeast three-hybrid assays. Gerbera B function proteins showed active behavior in ternary complexes. All Gerbera
SEP-like proteins with the exception of GRCD1 were excellent partners for B function proteins, further implicating the
unique role of GRCD1 as a whorl- and flower-type specific C function partner.
Conclusions: Gerbera MADS domain proteins exhibit both conserved and derived behavior in higher order protein
complex formation. This protein-protein interaction data can be used to classify and compare Gerbera MADS domain
proteins to those of Arabidopsis and Petunia. Combined with our reverse genetic studies of Gerbera, these results
reinforce the roles of different genes in the floral development of Gerbera. Building up the elaborate capitulum of
Gerbera calls for modifications and added complexity in MADS domain protein behavior compared to the more simple
flowers of, e.g., Arabidopsis.
Background
Reproductive roles of MADS box genes in plants extend
from determination of floral organ identity to other floral
processes such as control of meristem identity and determinacy, inflorescence architecture, and induction or inhibition of flowering (reviewed in [1]). The current view is
that MADS domain regulatory proteins accomplish this
multitude of tasks by forming higher order complexes,
which then act on promoter sequences of their target

genes [2,3]. In the simplest model, the higher order complexes are tetramers, or 'dimers of dimers' [4,5]. In this
'floral quartet' model, sepal identity is defined by an
AAEE quartet, petals by ABBE, stamens by BBCE and
carpels by a CCEE quartet, the letters referring to functions of the MADS domain proteins in the ABC and the
extended ABCDE models [4,6,7]. Other reproductive
functions such as meristem identity could be controlled
by similar tetramerous complexes in which at least the A
and E function proteins are thought to participate [8].
However, none of these higher order complexes have
been observed or verified in planta, and they could be

larger and more extensive than tetramers of MADS
domain proteins.
MADS transcription factors are highly conserved
across the plant kingdom and are easily recognizable by
the eponymous MADS domain, named after the first
identified members of the gene family [9-13]. The general
structure of the best studied type II MADS domain proteins consists of the conserved MADS and the plant-specific K (keratin-like) domains, which flank the less
conserved I (intervening) domain, and the C (carboxy terminal) domains. All of these protein domains have been
shown to be able to participate in dimerization processes.
The MADS domain has further DNA binding capacity
[14], whereas the variable C domain of some, but not all,
MADS domain proteins contains amino acids that function in transcriptional activation [2,15].
The first observed MADS protein dimer was the B
function heterodimer between DEFICIENS and GLOBOSA in Antirrhinum majus [13,16,17]. Many of the protein-protein interactions defined since then are highly
conserved among homologs in both monocot and dicot
plants [18]. The multimeric protein complexes interact
with their target promoter sequences [2,3] by binding to
cis elements with the canonical sequence CC(A/T6)GG,
termed the CArG box [10,13,14,16,19-21]. Each MADS
protein can participate in a number of different complexes, making the potential number of combinations,
and thus target gene sets, very large. Most of the reported
protein-protein interactions are between MADS domain
proteins themselves, but involvement of other proteins
have also been observed. Examples are the anther-specific secreted protein ATA20, the leucine zipper protein
MIP1, the seed specific histone fold protein NF-YB,
LEUNIG, which shares sequence similarity with yeast
Tup1 corepressor, the plant specific regulatory protein
SEUSS, and proteins PFMAGO1 and PFMAGO2, which
are homologous to highly conserved RNA binding proteins involved in many developmental processes [3,2226]. MADS domain protein complexes have also been
shown to act on their own promoters to regulate their
own expression, and to form autoregulatory loops that
stabilize their expression after induction [16,25,27-36].
We have contributed to floral developmental genetics
by investigating a model member of the sunflower family,
the ornamental plant Gerbera hybrida (reviewed in [37]).
The highly compressed inflorescences (capitula) of the
Asteraceae family differ from other model systems in that
they bear flowers of dissimilar type, showing differences
in sexuality, morphology and sometimes coloration. The
different flower types combine in the flower head into a
second-order structure resembling a single large flower an apparent pollination adaptation [17,38]. Control of
flower and inflorescence development therefore has extra
tiers in Gerbera. Not only must the correct floral organs

develop in correct places, but also particular types of
flowers must emerge along precise radial coordinates of
the inflorescence. We have previously shown that many
general principles of flower development apply to Gerbera [37,39,40], and that functional homologues for B, C
and E function genes can be identified. However, Gerbera
also has its own unique features. Whereas the Arabidopsis thaliana SEPALLATA (SEP) genes encode the E function in a redundant and whorl non-specific manner,
among several Gerbera SEP-like MADS box genes, a paralogous pair (GRCD1 and GRCD2) has apparently undergone subfunctionalization, showing non-redundant
whorl-specific functions in stamen and carpel development, respectively [41,42]. Interestingly, Gerbera MADS
box genes also show differential expression patterns along
the radius of the capitulum, suggesting that different
complexes may act on flower primordia to engender their
different developmental fates [43].
Studies on MADS domain protein higher-order complexes have been carried out in Arabidopsis, snapdragon,
Petunia hybrida and tomato [2,3,23,44-46]. Our aim was
to map MADS domain protein-protein interactions in
Gerbera, and to compare these interactions between Gerbera and other model systems. In this study, a total of
fourteen Gerbera MADS domain proteins active (or suspected to be active) in reproductive development were
included in an interaction study using yeast two- and
three-hybrid assays. These data, in combination with our
previous reverse genetics studies, provide intriguing new
information for Gerbera MADS domain proteins. Along
with the highly specialized E function proteins GRCD1
and GRCD2, Gerbera harbors a redundant pair of E function proteins, GRCD4 and GRCD5, which have an apparently general non-whorl-specific function. Despite
functioning as obligate heterodimers [13,19], B function
proteins of Gerbera are able to participate in higher order
complexes as independent proteins. Furthermore, they
have an extensive interaction capacity when present as a
dimer. The B function proteins show interaction with C
function proteins and with all Gerbera SEP-like proteins
except with staminodia-determining GRCD1. This might
indicate a special role for GRCD1 as a whorl- and flowertype specific C function partner.

Results
Phylogenetic positioning of Gerbera MADS box genes

Of the tested Gerbera MADS box genes, GSQUA1,
GGLO1, GDEF1, GDEF2, GAGA1, GAGA2, GRCD1,
GRCD2 and GRCD3 were included in a phylogenetic tree
published previously [41] and were placed among orthologous genes from other plant species. The phylogenetic
placements of GRCD1 and GRCD2 was further refined by
Zahn et al. [47], who showed them to be more distantly
related paralogs than previously suspected. GRCD4 and

GRCD5 (and the above genes) were added to the data set
of Zahn et al. [47] and phylogenetic results show them to
be related to other SEP-like genes (Additional file 1, Figure S1). The phylogenetic position of Gerbera SQUAMOSA/APETALA1 (SQUA/AP1) -like genes (GSQUAs)
is reported elsewhere [48]. To summarize, GSQUA1 and
GSQUA3 group together with AP1 and CAULIFLOWER
(CAL) of Arabidopsis [49,50], while GSQUA2, GSQUA4,
GSQUA5 and GSQUA6 are phylogenetically closer to the
Arabidopsis FRUITFULL (FUL) gene [51,52].
Expression patterns of Gerbera SEP-like genes

Of eudicot MADS box genes, C and B function genes
generally show a narrow expression pattern, which
directly reflects their function in carpel, stamen, and
petal development, respectively [27,53,54]. On the other
hand, the Arabidopsis SEP genes, necessary for several
processes in floral development, are widely expressed in
flowers [55-57]. In order to gain potential insight into
their function and interaction range, the expression patterns for Gerbera MADS box genes were studied using
RNA gel blots and in situ hybridization.
The expression patterns for GSQUA1, GDEF1, GDEF2,
GGLO1, GAGA1, GAGA2, GRCD1, GRCD2, GSQUA2,
GSQUA3, and GSQUA5 were reported previously
[39,41,42,48] (See Additional file 2, Table S1).
According to RNA gel blots probed with a gene specific
probe, strongest expression of GRCD3 was seen in inflorescence, petals and ovary. GRCD3 was also expressed in
carpel and receptacle and weak expression was detectable
in stamens, pappus bristles and bracts (Figure 1a).
GRCD3 expression was found to be strongest during the
earlier stages (1-7; see [58]) of Gerbera ray flower petal
development (Additional file 3, Figure S2), and only very

weak expression was seen at the last stages assayed, 1011.
GRCD4 expression was found to be strongest in young
Gerbera inflorescences (6-16 mm in diameter) and in
petals and ovaries, while carpels and pappus bristles gave
a slightly weaker signal for expression in the RNA gel
blot. Weak, but detectable signal was observed in the
receptacle and stamens. No signal was detected in the
inflorescence-derived green organs (scape and bracts), or
vegetative organs, which included leaf petioles, leaf
blades and roots (Figure 1b). GRCD4 was expressed
throughout ray flower petal development, clearly fading
toward later developmental stages (Additional file 3, Figure S2).
The expression of GRCD5 was inflorescence-abundant
according to an RNA gel blot probed with a gene specific
probe. GRCD5 was expressed in all floral whorls, with the
strongest expression detected in young inflorescence (616 mm) and petal samples. Slightly weaker expression
was detected in receptacle, stamens, carpel and ovary. In
bracts and the outmost floral whorl of Gerbera, pappus
bristles, GRCD5 was expressed at a very low level (Figure
1c). Interestingly, the expression of GRCD5 differs from
the expression of GRCD3 and GRCD4 during ray flower
petal development. Both GRCD3 and GRCD4 were
expressed at earlier stages of development, whereas
GRCD5 showed remarkable upregulation in the late
stages, when the Gerbera inflorescence starts to open
(Additional file 3, Figure S2). Our microarray study supported this observation [59].
GRCD3 was expressed in several floral organs as shown
by in situ hybridization. Strong expression was visible in
ovule, carpel and petals. Slightly weaker expression was
discovered in stamens and pappus bristles (Figure 2a). In
situ, both GRCD4 and GRCD5 were widely expressed in
all floral whorls, confirming the results shown by RNA
gel blots (Figure 2b and 2c). Overall, the expression patterns for both GRCD4 and GRCD5 were remarkably similar.
Gerbera SEP-like proteins are involved in broad pairwise
interactions

Pairwise interaction capacity between Gerbera MADS
domain proteins was tested for all combinations of the
fourteen proteins using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The
Gerbera proteins were translationally fused separately to
both the binding domain and the activation domain, and
were combined in both directions.
As summarized in Figure 3, the most broadly interacting proteins in pairwise assays are those phylogenetically
grouping with the E function, or SEP-like, MADS domain
factors. GRCD4 and GRCD5 each interacted with eight of
the fourteen proteins in the interaction screen, including
the only two self-interactions (homodimer formation)

GSQUA5. In addition, GRCD4 did not interact with
GAGA2, and GRCD5 not with GRCD2. Both GRCD4 and
GRCD5 were assayed as truncated proteins due to a
strong autoactivation reaction.
GRCD1 and GRCD2 have been functionally characterized previously, and they take part in whorl-specific
homeotic functions in stamens and carpels, respectively.
Furthermore, GRCD2 is required for meristem identity
and determinacy [41,42]. Compared to the Arabidopsis
SEP proteins, these two Gerbera proteins showed a limited interaction capacity in our assays. GRCD1 and
GRCD2 both interacted with the C-function proteins
GAGA1 and GAGA2, as we have previously observed. In
addition, GRCD1 had no other pairwise partners, while
GRCD2 interacted with GRCD4 and GSQUA2. GRCD3
has perhaps the most limited interaction pattern of the Eclass family, interacting pairwise only with GRCD4 and
GRCD5. GRCD3 is placed in the outermost branch
together with AGL6 of Arabidopsis [60].
The floral homeotic C function genes GAGA1 and
GAGA2 show similar expression patterns and similar
transgenic phenotypes [39]. Indeed, GAGA1 and GAGA2
behaved similarly as well in protein interaction assays,
forming dimers with the SEP-like Gerbera proteins
GRCD1, GRCD2 and GRCD5. GAGA2 also formed a
dimer with GRCD4.
The homeotic B function is represented in Gerbera by
the genes GGLO1 and GDEF2. These genes show strong
whorl-specific expression patterns typical of B function
MADS box genes, as well as characteristic homeotic
changes in transgenic Gerbera lines [39,61]. Gerbera also
harbors a TM6-like gene, GDEF1, which is closely related
to GDEF2, but based on its expression pattern and transgenic analyses, apparently does not contribute to the classical B function. Recent results indicate that TM6-like
genes take part in the control of stamen development
[62,63], also in Gerbera [61]. The GGLO1 and GDEF2
proteins show strong interaction as expected for a pair
responsible for the B function. Interestingly, GDEF1 also
interacts with GGLO1 in yeast. In a pairwise interaction
assay, these three proteins do not interact with any other
Gerbera MADS domain proteins.
Homeotic A function genes have not been described in
Gerbera - in fact MADS box genes responsible for sepal
and petal identity as per the ABC model have not been
identified in plants other than Arabidopsis, (reviewed in
[40,64]). Nevertheless, Gerbera contains several genes
similar to the Arabidopsis A function MADS box gene
AP1 and its paralogs CAL and FUL, or its ortholog in
snapdragon, SQUA [49-52,65]. Altogether six SQUA-like
genes have been identified in Gerbera [39,59,48]. Full
length cDNAs for GSQUA1, GSQUA2, GSQUA3 and
GSQUA5 were included in this study. The corresponding
proteins did not interact among themselves in any pair-

wise combination. All but GSQUA5 interacted with the
SEP-like protein GRCD5. Interestingly, GSQUA2 also
interacted with GRCD2 in the pairwise assay. GRCD2
represents another SEP-like gene in Gerbera, with pleiotropic functions in carpel identity, floral meristem identity and inflorescence determinacy [42].
Higher order complexes between Gerbera MADS domain
proteins

Plant MADS domain proteins are known to bind DNA
only after dimerization [16,19]. However, their function
in the regulation of flower development has been implied
to involve formation of higher order protein complexes,
possibly tetramers as depicted in the floral quartet model
[4,7]. We tested if higher order complex formation could
be promoted between Gerbera MADS domain proteins
that did not show pairwise interactions. This was done by
introducing a third protein into the system in the yeast
three-hybrid assay. For example, SEP-like proteins have
previously been reported to act as "glue proteins" by facilitating interactions between partners that remain inactive
in yeast two-hybrid studies [3,46]. In the yeast threehybrid assay, care was taken to avoid a positive signal due
to a pairwise interaction. However, the assay became
uninformative for this reason only in situations where the
three proteins all interacted pairwise. Our survey was not
exhaustive, but out of 531 possible (informative) combinations, 313 that were considered to be of high relevance
were tested. In a few cases, we found out that an activation function emerged when two MADS domain proteins
interacted. This type of autoactivation (see below) was
unexpected but is interesting. In practice, however, it
resulted in some uninformative three-hybrid assays.
The Gerbera B function proteins GGLO1 and GDEF2
formed a closed interaction pair showing pairwise association only with each other. Still, the GGLO1/GDEF2 heterodimer is involved in different developmental
processes, leading to petal development in whorl 2 and
stamen development in whorl 3. We tested formation of
higher order complexes by fusing GDEF2 (or GDEF1) to
the binding domain in pDEST32, then providing GGLO1
as an unfused protein in pARC351 to the yeast cells, and
assaying which Gerbera MADS domain proteins (those
not interacting with GDEF1 or GDEF2), fused with the
activation domain of pDEST22, gave a positive signal
when GGLO1 was already complexed with either GDEF1
or GDEF2. In these assays, both C-function proteins
GAGA1 and GAGA2 interacted with the GGLO1/GDEF1
and GGLO1/GDEF2 dimers. All Gerbera SEP-like proteins except GRCD1 showed interaction with GGLO1/
GDEF1 and GGLO1/GDEF2 dimers as well, although
none of them interacted with the B-class proteins alone.
Similarly, all GSQUA proteins interacted with the dimer
GGLO1/GDEF2 - but none of them with the dimer
GGLO1/GDEF1 (Figure 4).

Page 5 of 13

These results indicate that GGLO1, GDEF1 and GDEF2
are activated not only for their (putative) transcriptional
function by heterodimer formation, but also for their
capacity to recruit additional proteins to form a transcriptional complex. We also observed that all three B
clade proteins were, individually, captured into higher
order complexes when expressed together with various
combinations of GRCD and GSQUA proteins. Further,
combinations of a GAGA protein and a GRCD protein
typically recruited the GDEF proteins, but not GGLO1, in
higher order complexes (Figure 4).
The two C-clade genes GAGA1 and GAGA2 have been
considered similar in their function based on expression
patterns and transgenic analysis. Also the pairwise interaction patterns of GAGA1 and GAGA2 are very similar.
The test for higher order complexes with yeast threehybrid assay showed differences, however. Generally
GAGA1 was more active in threeway complexes than
GAGA2, and in addition they showed complementary
specificities in some cases. GAGA2 was active together
with GRCD1 and GSQUA proteins while GAGA1 was
not, and GAGA1 was active with several other GRCD/
GSQUA combinations where GAGA2 was not active.
Emerging transcriptional activation by complex formation

Interestingly, when the dimers GGLO1/GDEF1 and
GGLO1/GDEF2 were combined with an empty activation
domain containing vector pDEST22, or completely without an activation domain carrying plasmid, yeast growth
resulted on plates selecting for weaker interactions
(Additional file 4, Table S2). This was unexpected, since
transcriptional activation of MADS domain protein complexes are thought to be brought on by specific members
of the complex, typically proteins of the SEP family [66].
In order to avoid false results from the yeast three-hybrid
assay, we reassayed all sets of binding domain/unfused
proteins where yeast growth was observed, irrespective of
which MADS domain protein was fused to the activation
domain (Additional file 4, Table S2). In addition to
growth under weak selection for the GGLO1/GDEF1 and
GGLO1/GDEF2 dimers mentioned above, we observed
that the combinations GAGA1/GRCD2, GAGA2/GRCD2
and GSQUA2/GRCD2 (without added activation
domain) resulted in prominent growth of yeast under
strong selection. All of these proteins interacted pairwise
in yeast two-hybrid assay, but none of them alone had
autoactivation capacity. While obstructing a number of
yeast three-hybrid results (see Additional file 4, Table S2),
this phenomenon is interesting in itself and shows that
transcriptional activation may be a combined function of
two interacting proteins.

the yeast two-hybrid and three-hybrid assays. In addition,
we report expression patterns for three Gerbera SEP-like
MADS box genes, GRCD3, GRCD4, and GRCD5. Expression of other Gerbera MADS-box genes has been published previously (see Additional file 2, Table S1).
Although protein interaction in yeast is not always conclusive for interaction in planta, our analysis uncovered
intriguing information that can be used to compare and
classify Gerbera MADS domain proteins with reference
to those of Arabidopsis and Petunia, as well as to speculate, in the light of our reverse genetics studies, about the
regulatory roles of MADS box genes during differential
development of flowers and floral organs in Asteraceae.
GRCD4 and GRCD5 encode general E function proteins in
Gerbera

E function proteins have been reported to be particularly
active in forming heterodimers in yeast two-hybrid
experiments in several plant species [8,18,23,44,67]. For
example, the Arabidopsis proteins SEP1 and SEP3 form
nodes in the pairwise interaction map and are thought to
be responsible for transcriptional activation of a number
of different higher order complexes of MADS domain
proteins [67]. At least one of the redundant SEP proteins
is required for floral organ identity determination where
specificity is determined through the combination of A, B
and C function proteins [3]. In Gerbera, similarly to the
(redundantly encoded) E function in Arabidopsis, proteins from the SEP clade are needed to accomplish correct organ identity determination, and specifically, to
mediate the activity of the Gerbera C function encoded
by the genes GAGA1 and GAGA2 [41,42]. As the SEP-like
Gerbera gene GRCD1 is needed for stamen (more precisely, staminode) identity determination, and GRCD2 for
carpel identity determination, we have concluded that the
homeotic E function has evolved into a whorl-specific set
of subfunctionalized gene paralogs [41,42].
Mapping of Gerbera MADS domain protein interactions sheds new light on these conclusions and to the
roles of Gerbera SEP-like genes. While the Gerbera
GRCD1 and GRCD2 proteins have evolved to carry out
whorl specific functions similar to the E function in Arabidopsis, they have concomitantly lost their general focal
position in the interaction map - they interact with a very
limited number of other MADS domain proteins, in fact
nearly exclusively with the C function GAGA proteins,
for which they were described as necessary companions
based on transgenic phenotypes [41,42].
Instead, GRCD4 and GRCD5 display a hub-like position in the Gerbera interaction map similar to SEP1 and
SEP3 in Arabidopsis (Figure 5). Further, like SEP1 and
SEP3, GRCD4 and GRCD5 harbor transcriptional activation domains based on their autoactivation capacity in
yeast, making them the most likely Gerbera candidates

GRCD5 are shown in blue and red, respectively. Interaction between

for the necessary and general, whorl non-specific floral E
function proteins. This is supported by their expression
analysis, which shows that GRCD4 and GRCD5 are
expressed in all floral whorls. Although their interaction
capacity is partly complementary (Figure 3), lack of
prominent transgenic phenotypes for either of them
downregulated alone (data not shown) suggests redundancy. Specifically, this interpretation predicts that a
double transformant (with both GRCD4 and GRCD5
downregulated) should show a strong (negative) floral
phenotype.
GRCD1 and GRCD2 provide specialized functions in
Gerbera

While a general E function is encoded by GRCD4 and
GRCD5 in Gerbera, our interaction data reinforces the
conclusion [41,42] that GRCD1 and GRCD2 are specific
and necessary activators of the Gerbera C function,
encoded by the genes GAGA1 and GAGA2. However, the
whorl specificity of GRCD1 and GRCD2 function
remains incompletely characterized. Both genes are
expressed in whorls three and four, and both proteins
interact with GAGA1 and GAGA2. Nevertheless, GRCD2
cannot replace GRCD1 in whorl three, and GRCD1 cannot replace GRCD2 in whorl four [41,42]. Furthermore,
transgenic Gerbera plants in which GRCD1 is downregu-

lated carry petal-like organs in whorl three of ray flowers
(in place of the staminodia in non-transgenic plants), but
the stamens of the central disc flowers are nearly normal
and male fertile. As we have concluded previously, redundant action by other MADS domain proteins may be taking over the function of GRCD1 in disc flowers [41].
Unless a very low level of expression for GRCD1 is sufficient for normal stamen development in disc flowers, we
have yet to determine a disc-flower whorl-three-specific
GRCD1-like C function activator in Gerbera.
Differential interactions with the B clade proteins

Both the developmental and biochemical aspects of B
function genes have been found to be highly conserved
(reviewed in [68]). B function proteins are necessary for
petal and stamen development [6]. As Gerbera flower
types differ in size and development of exactly these two
organs, the behavior of B function proteins is of particular interest to us. We have earlier concluded that arrest of
stamen development in marginal flowers is not due to differential expression of GGLO1 or GDEF2 in developing
flower primordia; both genes are expressed strongly at
early stages of all flower types [39].
Yeast two-hybrid results indicated that both GDEF1
and GDEF2 proteins readily form heterodimers with
GGLO1. Remarkably, the B function dimers were discovered to have an intrinsic activation capacity, not present
in the proteins when expressed alone in yeast (Additional
file 4, Table S2). It is well known that dimerization of
MADS domain proteins is necessary for their capacity to
bind their target sequences (CArG boxes) in DNA [16],
but it has apparently gone unnoticed that dimerization
may also render them functional in transcriptional activation, at least in yeast. Other proteins are expected to
enhance activation by bringing in more activation capacity; however, even without external activation, the B protein dimer is active.
Yeast three-hybrid results further indicate that GGLO1,
GDEF1 and GDEF2 are also activated by heterodimer formation for the capacity to recruit additional proteins in
higher order complexes. Both GLO1/GDEF1 and
GGLO1/GDEF2 heterodimers interact strongly with the
Gerbera C function proteins GAGA1 and GAGA2. Similarly, all GSQUA proteins interact with the B function
dimer GGLO1/GDEF2, but none of them with the
GGLO1/GDEF1 dimer. The latter is the clearest difference we observed regarding the two Gerbera DEFICIENS-like proteins, and it demonstrates that GDEF1
and GDEF2 are not simply redundant. Instead of the classical B-function proposed for GDEF2, expression pattern
and transgenic phenotypes for the TM6-like GDEF1 suggest a role in stamen development [61].
Although none of the Gerbera SEP-like proteins
(GRCDs) interact pairwise with the B-clade proteins, all

Page 8 of 13

of them - except GRCD1 - show strong interaction with
GGLO1/GDEF1 and GGLO1/GDEF2 complexes. This
may speak for a very specific role for GRCD1 as a whorland flower-type specific C function partner. The observation relates to the findings of Ito et al. [69] regarding an
early, traditional homeotic role of AG in flower organ
development, and a late function in anther development.
The latter requires postulation of a yet-undescribed activator of AG in Arabidopsis [69], providing yet another
example where the C function is modulated in a certain
developmental context.
Single Gerbera B clade proteins participate in higher order
protein complexes

Gerbera B function proteins also participate in trimerous
complexes as single proteins. A recent study with tomato
proteins showed similar results [45]. Although GDEF2
and GGLO1 are traditionally thought to form an obligatory heterodimer to conduct their joint function, and
show dramatically increased interaction capacity when
expressed together in yeast three-hybrid, they also show
individual interactions with pairs of GAGA and GRCD
proteins. The B function proteins alone are also capable
of participating in trimerous complexes where none of
the involved proteins interact pairwise. GGLO1 complexes with GRCD1 and GSQUA3, or with GRCD4 and
GSQUA3, as well as with GRCD5 and GSQUA2. GDEF2
complexes with GSQUA1 or GSQUA5 when GRCD1 is
present, and weakly with GSQUA2 or GSQUA5 when
GRCD5 is present. It is not clear what roles, if any, lone B
function proteins may have in floral development.
The pleiotropic GRCD2 protein has hidden activation
capacity

GRCD2 has an extended role in flower development and
controls carpel identity, floral meristem identity and
inflorescence determinacy [42]. Down regulation of
GRCD2 in transgenic plants affects on all these processes,
but ectopic expression of GRCD2 does not lead to
observable phenotypes, indicating that this protein's
activity is dependent on additional factors. We have previously observed (and verify here) protein-protein interactions between GRCD2 and both of the Gerbera Cfunction GAGA proteins, which is in concordance with
both the homeotic and floral meristem identity role of
GRCD2. To our surprise, GRCD2/GAGA1 and GRCD2/
GAGA2 dimers showed strong capacity for transcriptional activation, not present for any of the proteins
alone. Another protein pair which gains marked transcriptional activation upon dimerization is GRCD2/
GSQUA2. G SQUA2 has, unlike any of the other MADS
box genes of Gerbera, a strong flowering inducing capacity when expressed ectopically [48]. Both GRCD2 and
GSQUA2 are co-expressed in the young undifferentiated

Ruokolainen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:129
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/129

inflorescences at the early stages of development, and
later the expression patterns of these genes overlap in
several floral organs [42,48].
A multitude of higher order protein complexes may be
critical for Gerbera stamen development

Based on the protein interactions presented in this study,
we propose hypothetical higher order protein complexes
involved in Gerbera stamen identity determination. For
determination of stamen identity, a B function protein
pair (GDEF2/GGLO1) is required, along with a C function protein (GAGA1 or GAGA2). Due to the expression
pattern of GDEF1, and its links to stamen development
[61], the GDEF1/GGLO1 dimer may also be involved.
The broad interaction capacity and transcriptional activation properties of GRCD4 and GRCD5 suggest that
they, or one of them, are needed for development of all
floral organs by bringing together higher order protein
complexes and activating them. In this scenario, an obvious deviation from the quartet model is that the number
of MADS domain proteins required for stamen development exceeds four.
GRCD1 is needed for stamen development in marginal
flowers, and in pairwise assays both Gerbera C function
proteins interact with GRCD1. We postulate that even if
GRCD1 does not interact directly with the B function
protein pair (Figure 4), one possibility is that it would participate in a higher order protein complex by first forming
a protein dimer with a GAGA protein. Alternatively, the
weaker interaction capacity of GRCD1, compared to
other GRCD proteins, could indicate a compromised
function, easily competed out by other components necessary for stamen development and eventually leading to
release of the developmental arrest in central flowers.
Data from microarray experiments show that GRCD1 is
in fact upregulated in marginal flowers compared to disc
flowers [43].
In vitro data confirming a specific role for MADS
domain protein tetramers has recently emerged [70,71],
but in planta data is still lacking. Combined analysis of
interaction between Gerbera MADS domain proteins
indicate that the actual higher order protein transcriptional complexes could be larger than proposed by the
quartet model, or (see also [72]) that higher order complex formation in quartets could be transient, with different proteins participating in an alternating manner.
Relatively broad expression patterns, especially of
GRCD1-5 [[41,42] and this paper] and GSQUA2-5 [48],
summarized in Additional file 5, Table S3, provide opportunities for both types of increased complexity.

Conclusions
Our study shows that Gerbera MADS domain proteins
are capable of forming a multitude of higher order com-

plexes in yeast assays. Gerbera MADS domain protein
behavior in higher order complexes displays both characteristics that are common to all higher eudicots, but also
specialized features, some of which may be specific to
Asteraceae and its complex inflorescence structure. For
example, in Gerbera the E function is split between the
highly specialized GRCD1 and GRCD2 factors, which are
active in stamens and carpels, respectively [41,42], and a
more general activation capacity provided by GRCD4 and
GRCD5. In other model species, such division of labor
among E function proteins has not been observed to this
extent. However, petunia E class proteins also differ in
their higher order complex formation capacity, and single
mutant analysis shows only minor phenotypic changes
[73,74,62]. In contrast to what has been observed for B
function proteins in general, Gerbera B function factors
(GGLO1, GDEF2 and GDEF1) can participate in higher
order complexes as single proteins, with the requirement
for heterodimerization bypassed. Based on the data presented here, we speculate that the differential development of Gerbera flower types, especially that of the
stamen whorl, requires more complexity than development of flowers in simple inflorescences that bear uniform flowers.

Methods
Gerbera MADS box genes used in interaction studies

Isolation of Gerbera MADS box genes GGLO1, GDEF1,
GDEF2, GAGA1, GAGA2 and GSQUA1 has been
reported previously [39]. Isolation of the Gerbera AP1/
SQUA-like genes (GSQUAs) is described elsewhere [48].
GRCD3 was cloned from a petal library using a degenerate oligonucleotide [75] encoding an eight amino acid
sequence of Arabidopsis AGAMOUS. GRCD4 and
GRCD5 were identified as full-length cDNA clones from
the Gerbera EST collection [59]. The recently identified
paralogue of GDEF2, GDEF3 [61], was not included in
this study. Summary of Gerbera MADS box genes used in
this study is shown in Additional file 2, Table S1.
Phylogenetic analysis

Parsimony analyses were performed on a nucleotide
sequence matrix, modified from [47] to include all Gerbera GRCD genes. The modified data set was first translated to aid alignment, and then precisely back-translated
to yield the original DNA sequences. The data set was
analyzed using the TNT application [76] with the "new
technology" option in a driven search using sectorial
searches, tree-drifting and tree-fusing [77]. Analyses were
run until a stabilized consensus had occurred twice using
equal character weights and tree bisection-reconnection
(TBR) branch swapping. Additional TBR branch swapping was performed on trees resulting from the initial
search to find additional equally parsimonious trees.

Ruokolainen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:129
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/129

Bootstrap support for internal branches was also estimated using TNT. The majority rule consensus tree is
shown collapsed for all branches with less than or equal
to 50% bootstrap support. Two hundred and fifty replicates were conducted, each performing TBR branch
swapping with 10 random entry orders saving one tree
per replicate. Absolute support values are reported.
Expression analysis of GRCD3, GRCD4 and GRCD5

Total RNA from different plant organs and from different
developmental stages of petals (stages 1-11, according to
[58]) was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, cat.
no. 11596-018). Equal amounts (10 μg) of RNA were run
in a 0.8% agarose gel as described in [58]. The rRNA
bands were visualized by EtBr staining to record even
loading of the gel. The RNA was blotted on a membrane
(Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized
(UltraHyb hybridization buffer, Ambion) with a genespecific probes (213, 245 and 314 bp) designed from the 3'
ends of GRCD3, GRCD4 and GRCD5 cDNA molecules,
respectively. Probes were labeled with [32P] dCTP and
hybridized at +42°C 16 h. The membranes were washed
with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at +42°C for 20 minutes. Subsequent washes were performed at +65°C for 15 minutes, 12 times.
In situ hybridization analysis was performed as
described in [78,79]. GRCD3, GRCD4 and GRCD5 genespecific sense and antisense probes (213, 245 and 314 bp)
were prepared and quantitated using DIG RNA labeling
kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μm thick paraffin sections were
mounted in 50% glycerol after hybridization.
Construction of Gateway entry plasmids

All full length Gerbera MADS box genes were introduced
as cDNAs into the Gateway system using PCR (PCR
Cloning System with Gateway Technology with
pDONR221, Invitrogen). Primers flanking the first methionine of the gene and the stop codon were designed
according to Invitrogen's instructions. Two nucleotides
were added between the attB1 sequence and the start
codon. Primers and Gateway sequences are shown in
Additional file 6, Table S4.
The PCR products were purified and recombined with
pDONR221 (Invitrogen) plasmid to create Gateway entry
clones according to the manufacturer's instructions. All
entry clones were sequenced to eliminate possible PCR
artifacts.
Yeast assays

Entry plasmids carrying Gerbera MADS box genes were
recombined with the activation and binding domain containing plasmids pDEST22 and pDEST32 (Invitrogen)
and transformed to yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

Page 10 of 13

strains PJ69-4A and PJ69-4α [80]. All plasmids were
introduced in both yeast mating types. The pDEST32
clones containing N-terminal binding domain fusions
were tested for autoactivation by plating them on the
yeast medium SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without
amino acids, 2% glucose, and appropriate amino acids)
lacking adenine (SD -Ade), or histidine (SD -His) and
supplemented with 1, 5 or 10 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole
(3-AT) (Sigma A8056). Autoactivation was observed for
GRCD4 and GRCD5, and C terminal deletions were
introduced to these constructs [81]. Deletions (Additional file 7, Figure S3) were designed so that the predicted alpha helical structure that starts within the
conserved K domain and extends towards the C terminus
of the protein was retained [82]. After deletions, autoactivation of the truncated constructs were retested both in
absence and presence of an empty activation domain containing vector and were found negative. To obtain yeast
double transformants, the A and α types of yeast strains
were mated by pipetting them on top of each other on
rich medium (SD Glu Complete). Yeast double transformants were plated on selection plates SD -Leu -Trp -Ade
and SD -Leu -Trp -His + 1, 5 or 10 mM 3-AT. The plates
were incubated at +22°C for 5 days. We scored a positive
signal for interaction capacity if either of the directions
resulted in growth of yeast on the selection medium
(Additional file 8, Figure S4). Reciprocal tests gave the
same result in all cases, except that the truncated GRCD4
fused to the binding domain gave consistently poor
growth with other Gerbera MADS domain proteins
except GRCD4 (homodimer formation) and GRCD5
(Additional file 9, Table S5).
For yeast three-hybrid assays, the plasmid pARC351
(Gateway compatible pRED-NLSa plasmid derivative, P.
Ouwerkerk; Gateway modifications by R. Immink) was
used to express the third protein of interest in yeast cells.
The previously cloned Gateway entry plasmids were
recombined with pARC351 according to Invitrogen's
instructions. The purpose of this assay was to see
whether two proteins inactive in yeast two-hybrid experiment could interact in the presence of a third protein. 313
combinations of three proteins were tested (Additional
file 4, Table S2). The criteria for selecting the combinations was decided based on the ABC(DE) model and the
previous results [2,6,7,83,73,84,85,45] The yeast threehybrid interactions were selected on plates SD -Leu -Trp Ura -Ade and SD -Leu -Trp -Ura -His, with 1, 5 and 10
mM, or 10 and 25 mM 3-AT, respectively. The plates were
incubated at +22°C for 7 days.
Some yeast three-hybrid combinations gave positive
signals regardless of which protein was fused with the
activation domain. For these combinations we run extra
controls where the activation domain containing vector
pDEST22 was left out or was present empty in the yeast

Ruokolainen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:129
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/129

cells. In these controls, strong intrinsic autoactivation
was discovered for Gerbera MADS domain protein dimers GRCD2/GAGA1, GRCD2/GAGA2, and GRCD2/
GSQUA2, rendering some of the studied ternary protein
complexes uninformative (see Additional file 4, Table S2).
The limitation applied to protein combinations where
GRCD2 was fused to the binding domain containing vector pDEST32, and GAGA1, GAGA2, or GSQUA2 was
supplied from pARC351 vector, or vice versa. Gerbera Bclade protein dimers GGLO1/GDEF2 and GGLO1/
GDEF1 selected under milder conditions exhibited similar autoactivation, but ternary complexes containing
either Gerbera B-clade protein dimer and activating
under stringent selection were scored as true positives.
