Abstract
Background: Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) receptors play a key role in the
early host response to viruses. In this work, we determined mRNA levels of two members of the
Toll-like Receptors family, (TLR3 and TLR7) and the helicase RIG-I, all of three recognizing viral
RNA products, in peripheral blood of healthy donors and hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, to
observe if their transcripts are altered in this disease.
Methods: IFN-α, TLR3, TLR7 and RIG-I levels in peripheral blood from healthy controls (n = 18)
and chronic HCV patients (n = 18) were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Results: Our results show that IFN-α, TLR3, TLR7 and RIG-I mRNA levels are significantly downregulated in patients with chronic HCV infection when compared with healthy controls. We also
found that the measured levels of TLR3 and TLR7, but not RIG-I, correlated significantly with those
of IFN-α
Conclusion: Monitoring the expression of RNA-sensing receptors like TLR3, TLR7 and RIG-I
during the different clinical stages of infection could bring a new source of data about the prognosis
of disease.

Background
Virus infection initiates a series of cellular events that lead
to the generation of an antiviral state both in the infected
cell and the surrounding tissue [1]. Toll-like receptors
(TLRs), an evolutionary conserved class of receptors
found in plants, Drosophila and humans, play a critical
role in the acquisition of this antiviral state. These receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) and elicit antimicrobial immune responses.

Until now, 10 different human toll-like receptors have
been described and several from these recognize viral
products [2,3]. Among the mammalian TLRs, three are
related to recognition of RNA. TLR3 recognizes doublestranded dsRNA [4] of viral origin and is expressed preferentially in dendritic cells [5]. Once engaged, TLR3 triggers
the activation of Interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a
transcription factor playing a critical role in the induction
of type I interferon and NF-κB through signaling processes

that require the protein Toll-interleukin-1 receptordomain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) [6,7].
The type I IFN further upregulates TLR3 in an autocrine/
paracrine manner, a phenomenon linked to its anti-viral
gene defense action [8]. However, with regard to dsRNA,
additional pattern-recognition receptors have been identified as candidates to initiate additional signalling pathways. One of these, retinoic-acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I),
has recently been identified [9] and seems to be emerging
as a key player in the induction of an interferon response
by viruses. RIG-I encodes for a RNA-dependent helicase
that is located cytoplasmically and is able to transmit
downstream signals to activate NF-κB and IRF-3. The triggering of RIG-I could be induced from inside cell by replicating viruses. Moreover, RIG-I appears to have, like TLR3,
a role in sensing HCV infection, thus forming an alternative pathway to establish an antiviral state [10].
TLRs 7 and 8 are close related phylogenetically and both
are sensors for viral, single-stranded ssRNA [11,12]. Tolllike receptor 7 appears to be preferentially expressed by
plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B lymphocytes whereas
TLR8 is expressed at moderate levels in monocytes [5].
These TLRs also trigger IRF-7 mediated type I IFN production upon activation, but unlike TLR3, the induction of
IFN by TLR7 and 8 is coupled to the adaptor protein
MyD88 and not to TRIF [13].
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a single-strand RNA virus that
infects liver and lymphoid cells [14]. Currently, an estimated 3% of the world's population -more than 170 million people- is infected with HCV [3]. HCV causes acute
and chronic hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [15],
and chronic HCV infection is the most common cause of
liver transplantation [16]. HCV is a single-stranded ssRNA virus and therefore susceptible to detection by TLR7
and 8. Nevertheless, its genome also encodes regions of
extensive secondary dsRNA structure that could be
engaged by other PAMP receptors during infection [1].
Moreover, as a positive ssRNA virus, replication of HCV
takes place through a minus-strand intermediate in a
membrane-bounded compartment [17]. Therefore, the
replicative machinery of HCV yields dsRNA intermediates
that are likely exposed to the cell dsRNA-sensing receptors, such as TLR3 [18]. With these data in mind, the aim
of this work was to determine the relative levels of TLR3,
7 and RIG-I mRNA expression in patients with and without chronic HCV infection and examine the potential of
these TLRs as biomarkers for HCV infection.

for this study. None of patients had received antiviral
treatment before entry into the study, in order to avoid the
possible effect of therapy on the expression of TLRs (such
effect has been described by Vollmer et al. [19]). From the
group of patients, whose clinical data are resumed in table
1, 8 had histologically or clinically confirmed cirrhosis
(Child-Pugh A n = 2, Child-Pugh B n = 6). Routine laboratory methods were used to determine serum aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
and viral load in HCV patients. All patients gave their written informed consent for the study. The study was
approved by the hospital ethics committee (Comisión de
Etica de la Investigación del Hospital de Cruces).
Peripheral blood was collected in PAXGene blood RNA
tubes (PreAnalytix GmbH, Switzerland). Then, total RNA
was extracted using the PAXGene RNA purification kit
(Qiagen GmbH, Germany) and purified with an intermediate, on-column, digestion with RNAse-free DNAse set
(Qiagen). The quantity and purity of RNA obtained was
assessed by measuring absorbance at 260 nm and the ratio
A260/A280 in a UV-spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Only
samples with an A260/A280 ratio from 1.9 to 2 were considered valid for RT-PCR.
500 ng of total RNA per sample was reverse transcribed
using QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen).
Briefly, samples were incubated for 2 minutes at 42°C in
a wipeout buffer to remove traces of genomic gDNA.
Then, reverse transcriptase and RT primer mix were added
and samples were incubated for 20 minutes at 42°C. A
final incubation for 3 min at 95°C was performed to inactivate reverse transcriptase. In all cases, the presence of
gDNA was excluded by performing the adequate control
reactions without reverse transcriptase.
The PCR for TLRs mRNA quantification was performed
with the LightCycler FastStart DNA SYBR-Green I kit
(Roche Applied Science, RAS, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the protocol provided in the parameter-speTable 1: Characteristics of HCV-infected patients included in this

cific Kits. Specific primer sets [5] optimized for the LightCycler (RAS) were developed and purchased from
SEARCH-LC GmbH, Heidelberg [30]. Human porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) was used as housekeeping
gene for internal control. To control for specificity of the
amplification products, a melting curve analysis was performed. No amplification of unspecific products was
observed.
For quantification and statistical analysis, target genes
mRNA expression was normalized to the expressed housekeeping gene PBGD using Relative Expression Software
Tool 2005 [20], which uses the pair-wise fixed reallocation randomization test as statistical model. This
approach overcomes the problems that make very difficult
to perform traditional statistical analysis, such as the
absence of standard deviation in ratio distributions. Correlation analysis was performed using non parametric
Spearman-Kendall test, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Results and discussion
In this preliminary work, we have used quantitative RTPCR to evaluate the expression of PAMP receptors related
with the recognition of viral RNA in peripheral blood of
healthy controls and HCV-infected patients. The mRNA
relative expression values for IFN-α, TLR3, TLR7 and RIGI are depicted in table 2 and illustrated in figure 1. It is
important to note here that the whisker-box plots that the
REST software draws in its reports (reproduced here in figure 1) are based upon permuted expression data rather
than the raw CP values obtained from the RT-PCR step,
because, as we described above, REST 2005® uses randomization techniques. The analysis of the RT-PCR data
through REST 2005® software shows that levels of the two
dsRNA sensing receptors TLR3 and RIG-I are significantly
lower in patients with chronic hepatitis C when compared
with healthy individuals (p = 0.008 and p = 0.002 respectively). With regard to TLR7 and IFN-α, there is also a significant lower expression in HCV patients (p = 0.004 and
p = 0.015 respectively).
The statistical regression analysis of the quantitative RTPCR data and clinical data showed no correlation between

the expression levels of the studied receptors and other
factors as viral load, AST/ALT levels or cirrhosis. However,
we found that the measured levels of TLR3 and TLR7, but
not RIG-I, correlated significantly with those of IFN-α(r =
0.670, p = 0.004 and r = 0.657, p = 0.005 respectively. Figure 2).
The RNA-sensing Toll-like receptors have been related
with the recognition and interferon-mediated response
against viruses [21-24] showing that they play a key role
in the innate response against viral infections. With regard
to HCV, it has been recently demonstrated that the viral
NS3/4A protease cleaves the TLR3 adaptor, TRIF [25], and
also targets CARDIF, an adaptor protein that links RIG-I to
the start of antiviral response [26] as a mechanism of
immune evasion. However, most of these reports have
been developed on in vitro or animal experimental systems. Here we show preliminary data of association
between the expression of TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I and HCV
infection in a clinical context. These receptors are downregulated in patients with chronic HCV infection, and the
expression levels of TLR3 and TLR7 (but not RIG-I) correlate strongly with the expression level of IFN-α, suggesting
that one of the mechanisms leading to the chronicity of
infection could be the acquisition of an "exhausted" state
of this antiviral machinery at the late stages of infection.
Moreover, this down-regulation appears to be related with
the infection, because the same analysis performed on
patients with liver cirrhosis not related with viral infections (mainly of alcoholic origin) did not show significant
differences when compared with healthy controls (our
unpublished results). With regard to the lack of correlation between the RIG-I and IFN-α expression levels, these
results could be explained by the fact that plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (the main producers of IFN-α at the innate
immune system) use the TLR system rather than RIG-I for
viral detection [27].
Our results are in agree with those of Taylor et al [28], in
which a reduced level of expression of TLR7 is observed in
HCV patients with poor response to interferon therapy.
Nevertheless, our results contrast with those recently published by Dolganiuc et al. [29], who show a wide up-regulation of almost every TLR (including TLR3 and TLR7) in

monocytes and lymphocytes of patients with chronic
HCV infection. However, this noticeable contradiction
between these two sets of results must be analysed with
care. First of all, the two sets of results are not directly
object of comparison, for the reason that different methodological approaches were used (cellular separation vs.
total blood, differences in housekeeping genes, different
algorithms and statistical tools applied to results from RTPCR assays...). Despite the benefits of relative quantification using RT-PCR in terms of sensibility and accuracy, a
standardised methodology for normalisation and analysis
of results remains to be widely accepted and, meanwhile,
every result must be observed cautiously. However, in this
case, we regard as a more significant issue to explain this
opposite results that the group of patients included in the
study by Dolganiuc et al. showed clinical parameters suggesting a less advanced stage of disease that the ones
included in this work (i.e., none of the patients included
in that study had cirrhosis at the time of inclusion as soon
as the average viral load was almost a log decade higher).
Thereby, those differences in clinical stage could explain
the discrepancy between the two set of results and hint for

a kinetic of these receptors related to the course of infection. Thus, the monitoring of these TLR levels during the
course of infection could bring a new source of data about
the prognosis of disease by using non-invasive techniques.
Nevertheless, the data presented here should be observed
only as part of a more complex picture. As it has been written above, the HCV has molecular strategies to evade signalling at least by TLR3 and RIG-I, thus leading to a
defective IFN response. Therefore, as our preliminary
results show, it could be of interest a monitoring of production of interferon α and β simultaneously to the PAMP
receptors expression and try to establish a correlation pattern between PAMP receptor levels and IFN levels, because
these data could allow detecting those evasive manoeuvres by HCV in its road towards chronicity.

Conclusion
The data presented here should be considered as a preliminary report from a work in progress that we are currently
developing at our laboratory, but they point to the fact
