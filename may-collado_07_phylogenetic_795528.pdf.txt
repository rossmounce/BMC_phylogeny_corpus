Abstract
Background: It is widely held that in toothed whales, high frequency tonal sounds called 'whistles'
evolved in association with 'sociality' because in delphinids they are used in a social context.
Recently, whistles were hypothesized to be an evolutionary innovation of social dolphins (the
'dolphin hypothesis'). However, both 'whistles' and 'sociality' are broad concepts each representing
a conglomerate of characters. Many non-delphinids, whether solitary or social, produce tonal
sounds that share most of the acoustic characteristics of delphinid whistles. Furthermore,
hypotheses of character correlation are best tested in a phylogenetic context, which has hitherto
not been done. Here we summarize data from over 300 studies on cetacean tonal sounds and social
structure and phylogenetically test existing hypotheses on their co-evolution.
Results: Whistles are 'complex' tonal sounds of toothed whales that demark a more inclusive
clade than the social dolphins. Whistles are also used by some riverine species that live in simple
societies, and have been lost twice within the social delphinoids, all observations that are
inconsistent with the dolphin hypothesis as stated. However, cetacean tonal sounds and sociality
are intertwined: (1) increased tonal sound modulation significantly correlates with group size and
social structure; (2) changes in tonal sound complexity are significantly concentrated on social
branches. Also, duration and minimum frequency correlate as do group size and mean minimum
frequency.
Conclusion: Studying the evolutionary correlation of broad concepts, rather than that of their
component characters, is fraught with difficulty, while limits of available data restrict the detail in
which component character correlations can be analyzed in this case. Our results support the
hypothesis that sociality influences the evolution of tonal sound complexity. The level of social and
whistle complexity are correlated, suggesting that complex tonal sounds play an important role in
social communication. Minimum frequency is higher in species with large groups, and correlates
negatively with duration, which may reflect the increased distances over which non-social species
communicate. Our findings are generally stable across a range of alternative phylogenies. Our study
points to key species where future studies would be particularly valuable for enriching our
understanding of the interplay of acoustic communication and sociality.

Background
Cetacean tonal signals are broadly defined as narrowband, frequency modulated sounds [1-3]. Such sounds
are produced by both baleen whales (Mysticeti) and
toothed whales (Odontoceti) – sister clades containing all
extant whales. They are also produced by other mammals
[e.g., [4]] and thus appear primitively present in the order.
Baleen whales produce sounds that have fundamental frequencies generally below 5 kHz [2,5], as do members of
the sister lineage of Cetacea, the hippos [4]. In toothed
whales, in contrast, these sounds most commonly range
from 5–20 kHz [2], and in some species, e.g. Delphinus delphis, Stenella attenuata, S. coeruleoalba, S. longirostris
[6]Lagenorhynchus albirostris [7], Tursiops truncatus [8], fundamental frequencies can go as high as 48 kHz in Inia geoffrensis [9]. In delphinid toothed whales these high
frequency tonal sounds, especially when complex, are
often referred to as 'whistles', although within the group
whistle acoustic characteristics vary enormously. Several
species produce both frequency modulated whistles (e.g.,
sine, convex, concave, upsweep, downsweep) and simple
whistles that are relatively constant in frequency (e.g.,
Lagenorhynchus albirostris, [7]; Sotalia fluviatilis [10];
Stenella longirostris [11], others are limited to simple whistles (Lipotes vexillifer) [12] or to few frequency modulated
whistles (e.g., mostly downsweep in Inia geoffrensis) [9]. In
addition, whistle contour may be continuous or consist of
a series of breaks and segments [2]. Whistles may or not
contain harmonics [2]. In delphinid species like S. longirostris [13] and L. albirostris [14] whistles can contain high
order-harmonics. Finally, whistle duration is very variable. For instance, in Sousa chinensis whistles can range
from 0.01 to 1.3 seconds [15] and in Tursiops truncatus
from 0.05 to 3.2 seconds [16]. In delphinids, whistle frequency modulation and duration varies within species in
relation to geography [e.g., [10,11,16,17]], and related
species differ in many whistle frequency components
(e.g., maximum, minimum, end, and start frequency)
[e.g., [18-22]].
Baleen whales produce a great variety of sounds, among
them tonal sounds that like toothed whale 'whistles', are
narrowband and frequency modulated, although typically
much lower in frequency [1]. These tonal sounds can be
produced in isolation or in combination with other
sounds (e.g. pulsative sounds). In the Right whale
(Balaena glacialis) these tonal sounds, again like 'whistles'
in toothed whales, are used in a social context [23]. For
example, in Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) tonal
sounds are presumably used for long-distance communication [24], and in Right whales tonal sounds are used in
combination with pulsative sounds in a sexual context
[25]. However, in baleen whales, these tonal sounds are
never referred to as whistles, but as 'calls', 'moans' or
'tones' [26,24,27-29]. Nomenclature of sounds, both in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/136

toothed and baleen whales, is confusing. As stated by Au
(2000: 31) [1] in baleen whales "as with dolphins there is
a lack of any standard nomenclature for describing emitted sounds", this frustrates comparison of sounds across
taxa and obscures homologies. It remains unclear exactly
what is a 'whistle', and if narrowband, frequency modulated tonal sounds of baleen whales and toothed whales
are homologous at some level. One reason to question
tonal sound homology across whales is that the sound
production mechanisms of baleen whales and toothed
whales are dramatically different. In baleen whales tonal
sounds are thought to be laryngeal [30,31], as they are in
other related mammals [e.g. [4,32]], but in toothed
whales sounds are produced by a unique and complex
nasal system [e.g. [33,34]]. This offers some support for
the hypothesis that toothed whales 'whistles' are unique
and different from (not homologous with) baleen whale
tonal sounds. However, this also suggests that high frequency tonal sounds are homologous across toothed
whales and such sounds in non-delphinid toothed whales
should also be called whistles (contra Podos et al. 2002)
[35]. To accommodate both possibilities we do all analyses across all whales (allowing for potential homology of
tonal sounds across the order) and separately within
toothed whales.
Most of the work on whistles has been done with social
delphinids, where they are often referred to as "social signals" and are thought to facilitate individual recognition,
group cohesion, recruitment during feeding activities, and
overall communication [e.g., [1,3,36-44]]. Generalizations about the function of whistles have translated into
the hypothesis that whistles evolved in concert with
sociality, and that the two traits are tightly correlated [e.g.,
[45,35]]. Herman and Tavolga (1980) [45] suggested that
the degree of gregariousness in toothed whales seemed to
be related to whistle production [see also [46]]. More specifically, they proposed that species that live in small
groups or are solitary tend not to whistle, whereas species
that live in large groups frequently do. Recently, Podos et
al. (2002) [35] proposed that whistles are an innovation
of social delphinids; in other words that whistles are
synapomorphic for a clade within Delphinidae. However,
even within delphinids some social species such as Cephalorhynchus spp and some species of Lagenorhynchus do not
whistle [e.g., [46,47]], which seems to contradict the dolphin hypothesis. The hypothesis was furthermore based
on an assumption of the absence of whistles in river dolphins (Inia, Lipotes, Platanista, and Pontoporia), porpoises
(Phocoenidae), beaked whales (ziphids) and belugas and
narwhals (Monodontidae). However, we do not believe
this assumption is justified. Tonal sounds from Inia geoffrensis, for example, have been independently recorded in
several studies [9,21,22,48]. These sounds, just like in
other toothed whales, have been referred to as whistles,

although they are simpler and shorter in duration, and
higher in frequency than the whistles of some dolphins
[9]. Similar whistles have also been reported in another
river dolphin Lipotes vexillifer [e.g., [12,49,50]] and in
social non-delphinid toothed whales such as some
beaked whales [51,52], and the Monodontidae, belugas
and narwhals [e.g. [53-57]]. Podos et al. (2002) [35] concluded that the tonal sounds in these species should not
be classified as 'whistles', and hence found support for the
dolphin hypothesis. While we agree with Podos et al. that
whistle structure seems different in delphinids and nondelphinid toothed whales we believe this demonstrates
the basic problem of treating broad, arbitrary, concepts as
single traits in evolutionary analyses. To define whistles as
social sounds produced by delphinids – a priori denying
homology with tonal sounds in related taxa – and then
concluding that they evolved in association with sociality
in Delphinidae risks circularity. In such a framework
reconstructing the origin of 'whistles' on a phylogeny will
simply depend on the whistle definition chosen by any
given author.
To facilitate discussion, and comparability with previous
research, we use the word 'whistle' for toothed whales
tonal sounds, however, we do not imply that whistles are
necessarily non-homologous to baleen whale tonal
sounds – their homology requires further study. We use
whistles as a category for some of our analyses, mainly to
test the dolphin hypothesis as it was proposed. It is not
very informative, however, to simply map the distribution
of 'whistles' on a phylogeny (Fig. 1, [see Additional file
1]). Authors differ in their interpretation on the presence
or absence of whistles across species, e.g. some define
them in the context of a behavior that may have much
more limited distribution than the sounds themselves.
Furthermore, even within dolphins 'whistles' can be
highly variable. We thus highlight the need to focus on the
various acoustic parameters (such as frequency variables,
modulation, etc.) that may vary independently and have
non-identical phylogenetic distributions [see Additional
file 1 for rationale]. Hence, our major focus is on such
analyses which may reveal which, if any, of the characteristics of 'whistles', or tonal sounds in general, seem associated with sociality.
Our understanding of tonal sound acoustic structure,
diversity, and use, is growing, but the evolution of tonal
sounds and their association with sociality remains highly
speculative. We therefore believe we here improve upon
previous studies by providing a more detailed analysis,
and using novel and more detailed phylogenies than any
study hitherto. We also test these hypotheses across a
range of alternative phylogenies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/136

In sum, we here review current knowledge of both tonal
sound production and social structure in Cetacea, and
explore the evolution of tonal sounds and the association
of individual tonal sound components with sociality
(overall social structure and social components). Taking
advantage of a new species-level cetacean phylogeny
[58,59] we provide the first phylogenetic test of the
hypotheses of Herman and Tavolga (1980) [45] and
Podos et al. (2002) [35]. This study identifies large gaps in
knowledge on both traits, and points to key species where
future studies would be particularly valuable for enhancing our understanding of the interplay of tonal sounds
and sociality.

Results
Testing the Dolphin Hypothesis
The following is presented merely to test the dolphin
hypothesis as stated (see Introduction, Methods, and [see
Additional file 1] for problems with this coarse
approach). Under the definition of 'whistle' we use here,
the optimization of whistles on the phylogeny is ambiguous (Fig. 1b). However, all of the equally most parsimonious reconstructions reject the dolphin hypothesis. The
phylogeny implies that whistles either evolved independently twice, once in Berardius and once in the node leading
to Delphinida sensu Muizon (1988) [60], delphinoids
plus river dolphins + Platanista (a clade we here refer to as
Pandelphinida), with secondary losses in Phocoenidae
and within Delphinidae (Cephalorhynchus spp. and Lissodelphis spp.). Alternatively whistles evolved once in the
common ancestor of ziphiids plus pandelphinids and
then were subsequently lost thrice in Hyperoodon, phocenids and within delphinids (the optimization of whistles
is equally ambiguous on previously published phylogenies, [see Additional files 2, 3, 4], while dual origin of
whistles is better supported when optimized across the
entire set of filtered post-burnin trees, see Methods). Likewise, there are two possible optimizations of sociality
under a broad concept approach. One is that sociality
evolved in the common ancestor of Odontoceti and was
then lost secondarily twice in the riverine species (Fig. 1b).
Alternatively sociality may have evolved independently
four times (in Physeter macrocephalus, within Ziphiidae,
Pontoporia, and in Delphinoidea). The optimization of
sociality is ambiguous on over 99% of the alternative trees
examined, however, the multiple loss of sociality within
Cetacea seems more likely in general, given that relatives
of whales are social. Regardless of choice of optimizations, whistles did not originate in the lineage leading to
the social dolphins, contra the dolphin hypothesis.
Character Optimizations
Results of character optimizations led to the same conclusions across all alternative phylogenies examined (previously published hypotheses, [see additional files 2, 3, 4],

brief glance at the black branches (indicating presence of tonal sounds/whistles and 'complex' sociality) on each side does not
suggest detailed correspondence of acoustic structure with sociality. In other words whistles have a different phylogenetic distribution than does complex sociality etc, indicating that their co-evolutionary history (if any) may be more complicated than
previously thought.

sociality in cetaceans. Future studies will require examining a greater number of component characters of sociality
as such data becomes available, and it will require the
inclusion of comparative social data also from the outgroups.
We compare three optimizations of sociality represented
as a four-state character (social structure) (see Table 1 and
[see Additional file 5]). First, we keep polymorphic species (species reported to show more than one type of
social organizations) as such and then compare results
when the 'lowest' and 'highest' social state is chosen for
each polymorphic species (Fig. 3). All three optimizations
have some ambiguity, but optimizations across all trees
suggest that family based groups evolved independently at
least three times (Physeter, Monodon, and Globicephalinae
Fig. 3). The optimization of social components (including
polymorphism) is shown in additional material [see

Additional file 6]. Group composition appears to have
ancestrally been simple groups consisting only of mother
and calf. Segregated (by sex and/or age) and mixed groups
may have evolved independently at least four times [see
Additional file 6b]. Finally, member associations appear
to have evolved from simple mother and calf interactions
to complex family based associations [see Additional file
6c].
Figure 4 shows the optimization of each acoustic character
(all transformed using the natural log). Relatively high
maximum and minimum frequencies (both absolute and
mean) appear derived in toothed whales (Fig. 4a–b, d–e).
Particularly high mean maximum and minimum frequencies have evolved within delphinids (note that some of

ables in color ranges; [see Additional file 7 for greater
detail].
There appears to be a similar trend in the number of tonal
sound inflection points (an indicator of tonal sound complexity) going from few ancestrally and increasing in the
lineage leading to the dolphins (Fig. 4f). There is an
inverse trend in tonal sound duration, where particularly
short tonal sounds appear to be derived within the delphinids (Fig. 4c).
Character regressions and correlations
Under the independent contrast method the regression
between group size and the mean number of inflection
points was marginally significant: species with larger
groups tend to produce tonal sounds with greater mean
number of inflection points. Group size explained
approximately 7.9% of the variation in inflection points
across cetaceans (p = 0.05, df = 33 see Fig. 5 (this and
some of the following results are dependent on the choice
of phylogeny, see section Phylogenetic uncertainty). Group
size also significantly explained variation in the mean
minimum tonal sound frequency within toothed whales

(R2 = 12.4%, df = 23, p-1tailed = 0.04). We justify using a
one-tailed test based on the expectancy that low frequency
sounds travel longer distances so that a priori one might
expect that low frequency tended to be associated with
solitary species, while species that live their entire lives in
large groups need only communicate over short distances.
However, given that the two tail test is non-significant we
consider this hypothesis only weakly supported. Regressions between group size and other acoustic parameters
were not significant.
In addition, there is a significant negative relationship
between tonal sound duration and absolute and mean
minimum frequency both for all cetaceans (Abs-MinF, Rsquare = 17%, p = 0.02, df = 31, Mean-MinF, 17.5%, p =
0.02, df = 29) and for toothed whales (Asb-MinF, Rsquare = 38%, p < 0.001, df = 22, Mean-MinF, R-square =
24%, p = 0.01, df = 23). There was a significant positive
relationship between tonal sound duration and complexity for all cetaceans (R-square = 12%, p = 0.04, df = 32)
and for toothed whales (R-square = 45%, p < 0.001, df =
23).

Changes in tonal sound complexity were significantly
concentrated within social lineages in four of the five
most parsimonious reconstructions when both traits were
treated as two state characters [see Additional file 8f] .
Tests of character state associations (SIMMAP) show that
complex whistles (state 1 = more than one inflection
points) were positively associated with group living species (Dij = 0.13, p > 0.999) and negatively with less social
species (Dij = -0.024, p < 0.001) treating social complexity
as a two state character. In general there was an association between tonal sound complexity and social structure
(Dstatistic = 0.376, p < 0.001, Table 2). However, the associations between individual states vary depending on how
finely tonal sound and social characters are divided (Table
2). For instance, when treating social complexity as a four
state character but tonal complexity as a two state character we find a significant positive association between
highly social species (states 2 and 3) and complex tonal
sounds and a negative association between complex tonal
sounds and 'solitary' (state 0) species (Table 2). When
both are treated as four state characters only negative associations are significant (but in the same directions as
before, see Table 2).
When three component characters of sociality were analyzed we found similar significant character associations
with inflection points (Group size Dstatistic = 0.394, p <
0.001; Group Composition Dstatistic = 0.306, p < 0.001;
Stability/Associations Dstatistic = 0.364, p < 0.001, [see
Additional file 9 and legend for detail], all indicating asso-

ciation between complex whistles and high levels of
sociality.
Phylogenetic uncertainty
In general, most of our findings are not strongly dependent on the phylogeny of choice, as long as all the species
are included. In other words, results in most cases are similar whether the data are analyzed across the trees favored
by our own analyses (all post burnin trees and post
burnin trees filtered using agreement among multiple
studies), or restricted to trees filtered to be congruent with
the alternative hypotheses of Messenger and McGuire
(1998) [61], Nikaido et al. (2001) [62] or Arnason et al.
(2004) [63], respectively (see Methods for detail). On the
all-species phylogenies results significant in the main
analyses were also significant across all sets of trees for all
SIMMAP analyses. The only difference between analyses
was that social and whistle character states were more
strongly associated on the trees constrained by the Messenger and McGuire hypothesis than in the remainder [see
Additional file 10]. Similarly, the PDAP analyses results
agree irrespective of phylogeny choice [see Additional files
11 and 12], except the following. Group size and number
of inflexion points correlate significantly except on trees
constrained by the hypotheses of Arnason et al. (2004)
[63] or Nikaido et al. (2001) [62], and group size and
mean minimum frequency correlate except on trees constrained by the Messenger and McGuire (1998) [61]
hypothesis. For ancestral character reconstruction under
parsimony, the optimizations of the continuous characters such as group size, tonal sound frequencies, duration,
and inflexion points are nearly identical across the trees

considered. The optimization of whistles as a presence/
absence character was ambiguous on our, and previous,
phylogenetic hypotheses. However, on 70% of the filtered
post-burnin trees dual origin of whistles was preferred
(see above). The optimization of sociality (as a two state
character) was ambiguous (single origin followed by multiple losses, or two origins followed by fewer losses),
except on the Nikaido et al. (2001) [62] hypothesis which
favors two origins of sociality. Similarly optimizations of
whistles and sociality as multistate characters varied little
across trees with no impact on conclusions.
When we used the phylogenies resulting from reanalyzes
of the data of Messenger and McGuire (1998) [61], however, significance was lost in a higher number (although
not the majority) of the hypotheses tests [see Additional
files 10, 11, 12] and some character optimizations
changed. Although this can in theory imply sensitivity to
phylogenetic pattern, a simpler explanation for this finding seems to be that much of the power of the comparative tests is lost as Messenger and McGuire's data [61]
includes only a portion of the species of our main dataset.
Hence we do not see a reason to discuss these 'disagreements' further.

Discussion and conclusion
Our results show that the interplay of tonal sounds and
sociality is complicated and that studying the relationship
between conglomerate characters such as 'whistles' and
'sociality' largely conceals these intricacies. Under the very
simple 'concept approach' the cladistic test [see [64]]
rejects the dolphin hypothesis stating that 'whistles'
evolved as an adaptation for social communication in
dolphins. Whistles, as here defined, appear to be a
synapomorphy of pandelphinids, or even a more inclusive group including ziphiids (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the current evidence implies that whistles arose earlier in the
evolutionary history of whales than presumed by Podos et
al. (2002) [35], and whistles are furthermore present in
some non-social species, and have been lost more than
once within social clades. Apparently then, whistles are
not necessary for functional cetacean societies and social
communication, and they can play some role in communication in solitary species.
Our findings highlight some of the problems with evolutionary analyses of imprecise, broad concepts. Even
though 'whistles' do not correlate with any measure of
sociality we find evidence that the evolutionary histories
of sociality and tonal sounds are intertwined in the direction suggested by many authors, including Podos et al.
(2002) [35]. This is evidenced mainly by two findings. (1)
The significant association between group size and tonal
sound inflection points (complexity) whether tested using
independent contrasts, concentrated changes, or character

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/136

association tests; and (2) the association between group
size and minimum tonal sound frequency (and the association of the latter with duration). Simple tonal sounds
are mostly confined to species with simple societies
(mostly solitary) such as river dolphins and rorquals
while tonal sound and social complexity increase in the
lineage leading to Delphinoidea (Tables 2). Within that
lineage reversal to simpler societies has occurred twice
and each time tonal sounds have been secondarily lost
(Figs 1a–b, 3), although whistle loss may represent a
response to predatory pressure rather than change in
social structure (see below).
In addition, especially in toothed whales, species emitting
longer tonal sounds tend to show a greater number of
inflection points. These observations and tests are congruent with hypotheses stating that complex tonal sounds
function as social signals for group cohesion (e.g., most
delphinids) during social, traveling, and feeding activities
[e.g., [42,65]] or individual recognition (e.g., bottlenose
dolphins,
Atlantic
spotted
dolphins)
[e.g.,
[3,37,41,66,67]].
But functionality in a social context can only explain a
portion of the variation in tonal sound production and
complexity. The secondary loss of tonal sounds in porpoises and the dolphin clade containing Lagenorhynchus
australis, L. cruciger and Cephalorhynchus spp, for example,
suggests these signals may sometimes be costly, for example in terms of energy production or predation risk. These
odontocetes live in very fluid societies where acoustic
communication is accomplished by means of rapid
pulsed sounds [47,68]. One potential costs of tonal
sounds is that these signals may be intercepted (eavesdrop) by an unintended receiver [69,70]. Delphinid tonal
sounds are within a frequency range that is readily
detected by predators like killer whales which are known
to predate on many marine mammal species including
these non-whistling species. Furthermore, porpoises and
Cephalorhynchus seem to have converged upon similar
morphology and biosonar systems [71,72], both have ears
tuned for high frequency sounds and produce narrowband clicks [73] that are used for echolocation purposes
and communication [74,75]. As emphasized by Morisaka
and Connor (2007) [76] if killer whales poorly detect
these signals, then it may be beneficial for these species to
use high frequency signals for social communication
[73,74] instead of tonal sounds.
In stable societies like those of Physeter macrocephalus and
Orcinus orca, animals tend to produce group-specific
sounds (termed codas and calls respectively) whereas in
fission-fusion societieslike those of Tursiops truncatus and
Stenella frontalis, animals produce individual-specific
whistles, so called "signature whistles" [see [3,15,41,38]].

Page 9 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:136

Signature whistles are sounds (single-loop and multipleloop) [see [75]] that to date have only been found in species with fluid societies where mother and calf use them as
contact calls and some animals (particularly males) form
coalitions (individual recognition may be important
when
forming
these
alliances)
[e.g.,
[15,37,38,44,66,67,73,77-82]].
We found evidence for association between group size
and the mean minimum frequency, as well as between
mean minimum frequency and duration. Given that the
former was only marginally significant, we will not place
much emphasis on this finding. However, if this finding
will be better supported with the addition of further data
it may suggest that low minimum frequency (and long
duration) is selected for in mostly solitary species which
must communicate with other individuals over relatively
greater distances than do species that live in permanent
societies. It should be noted that May-Collado et al.
(2007) [59] found a correlation between minimum frequency and body size across whales. This may explain a
part of the observed pattern here, as social species are
often small, but it remains to be explored if sociality and
body size are correlated.
Despite the possible differences in the context in which
tonal sounds are produced by riverine dolphins and other
delphinoids, there is no a priori reason to assume that
whistles produced by these toothed whales are not
homologous (contra Podos et al. 2002) [35], and phylogenetically their homology is supported (Fig. 1). It has
been proposed that marked deviations of Inia from delphinids in scaling relationship in body size and frequency
[e.g., [21,83]] is evidence that their sounds are produced
by mechanisms different from those used by delphinoids.
This is primarily based on the assumption that vertebrate
scaling of vocal frequency occurs through size-dependent
effects on a common vocal apparatus [e.g. [80]], thus deviations from scaling relationships might indicate an independent proximate mechanism [35]. However, these
scaling patterns, for maximum frequency disappear once
phylogenetic relationships are taken into account [59].
While some cetacean societies have been studied for a
long time, detailed observations are lacking for many species and it is difficult to define and compare levels of
sociality across cetacean species. Likewise there are many
gaps in our knowledge of tonal sound production [see
Additional files 5 and 7]. Our study highlights critical gaps
in knowledge, and pinpoints key taxa whose future study
could quickly enhance our understanding of the evolution of tonal sounds. As can be seen in Figure 1, tonal
sound data would be especially valuable from Kogia,
ziphiids other than Berardius, and from Platanista and Pontoporia. In a similar manner information on social struc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/136

ture of Kogia, Mesoplodon, and Ziphius would help resolve
the optimization of sociality.
Many factors in addition to sociality have been proposed
to have influenced the evolution of tonal sounds, including body size and maximum frequency scaling
[21,35,59,83,84], habitat [21], predation [76], and zoogeographical [20] and phylogenetic relationships [20,21].
Given that multiple factors are at work true co-evolutionary histories of any given characters could easily be
masked. Hence, finding significant correlations between
tonal sounds and social structure is particularly interesting. For example, we find a significant, but rather weak,
correlation between group size and inflexion points using
the independent contrast method. One of the conspicuous outliers in this analysis is Orcinus orca, a social delphinid living in relatively small groups that nevertheless
produces extremely modulated whistles. Thomsen et al.
(2001) [85] discuss these extreme modulations and suggest that whistles in killer whales serve a different function
than in related dolphins. Removing O. orca from the analyses increases the strength of the correlation between
whistle complexity and group size (R-square = 9.7%, pvalue = 0.03). It should furthermore be noted that comparative biology is fraught with difficulty, getting enough
data together for a strong hypothesis testing is typically
difficult and missing data results in a loss of power. By
accounting for uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships
we hope to reduce the rate of type I error. Further,
accounting for differences in interpreting and scoring
whistle and sociality data attempts to reduce type I error.
It is quite possible that in an attempt to avoid type I error
we are introducing an unacceptable amount of type II
errors. In other words, our ability to detect true character
correlations in evolutionary history may be compromised. In this study, however, most of the results were not
sensitive to choice of phylogeny or alternative scoring scenarios which adds some confidence to our conclusions.
Our findings point to gaps in knowledge of both tonal
sounds and social structure that need to be filled to significantly advance our understanding of their putative coevolutionary histories. Nevertheless, our results allow us
to reject the simple hypothesis that 'whistles' evolved for
social communication in dolphins. However, group size
explains some of the variation in tonal sound frequency
and frequency modulation indicating a special role for
complex tonal sounds in a (complex) social context and
perhaps for low frequency, long-duration sounds in solitary species. May-Collado and Wartzok (2007) [9] suggested that whistles in Inia geoffrensis may be use to keep
distance between animals rather than to stimulate social
interactions. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested.
Future studies should focus on particularly poorly known

Methods
Definitions
For purposes of this study the association between tonal
sounds and sociality will be studied under both a broad
concept [tonal sounds and whistles versus sociality, emulating previous studies], and using a 'component'
approach whereby tonal sounds and sociality are dissected into (some of) their component characters. For
tonal sounds, standard acoustic parameters we use here
include absolute and mean minimum and maximum fre-

Current knowledge on cetacean sociality indicates the
existence of a wide range of social structures, ranging from
'solitary' to highly structured group living species [see
[86]]. Generally in the study of cetacean sociality, social
species are those that show evidence of group living [87]
where animals are associated in a nonrandom fashion
[88]. Under the broad concept approach, we have classified species into two general social frameworks, one simply organizing species into non-group living species (state

Figure 5
Regression analysis between independent contrasts of mean group size and mean number of inflection points
Regression analysis between independent contrasts of mean group size and mean number of inflection points. One conspicuous outlier (arrow) represents a contrast including the killer whale (Orcinus orca) which forms relatively small social groups but
produces highly modulated whistles. It has been proposed that the killer whale uses whistles in a manner different from any
other delphinid to indicate motivational state. That multiple factors are at work shaping tonal sounds in cetaceans may obscure
and make difficult to discover true co-evolutinary histories of characters. Accordingly when O. orca is removed from the analysis the regression between the two characters becomes stronger.

0) and group living species (state 1) and a second one
assigning species to four social types (Table 1, [see Additional file 5]. Under the component approach, we also
examine some component characters of sociality for
which there is sufficient data available (group size, composition, and stability/associations) either from short
and/or long term studies as well as anecdotal observations
(Table 1, [see Additional file 5]). Table 1 provides detailed
descriptions of these character and their states. It is important to note that for any type of qualitative characterization of sociality, some species may fit into more than one
category due to intraspecific variation. For instance, some
populations of Stenella longirostris have unstable (or
'fluid') groups whose compositions change throughout
the day, while populations in the Hawaiian atolls exhibit
long-term group fidelity and social stability [89]. These,
and other limitations of this study should be kept in mind
when interpreting our findings, nevertheless, we believe
our approach improves upon previous attempts to detect
the associations between sociality and tonal sound production in whales.
Character Optimizations
Published data on cetacean tonal sound production and
sociality were obtained from literature and personal communications [see Additional files 5 and 7]. For tonal
sounds we compiled information on the most used acoustic parameters: absolute and mean minimum frequency,

absolute and mean maximum frequency, duration, and
mean number of inflection points. We only considered
studies conducted in the wild or in captivity where, based
on the information provided by the authors, it could be
assumed species were not recorded in mixed-species
groups. We assumed authors were not including harmonics in the acoustic measurements of the tonal sounds
emitted by the studied species, unless specified. Information about the social structure of cetaceans was obtained
from short to long-term studies, as well as anecdotal information. We searched for information for each of the following social components group size, composition,
stability and associations patterns. In addition, information on these social components was used to define four
social categories. A minimum of two components was
required to place a species within a social category as
defined in Table 1. Species for which insufficient components were available were coded as unknown. For species
with populations that varied in their social structure or
any of the social components ('polymorphic') we selected
the highest social state for that particular character. Group
size is analyzed as a continuous character using the highest mean group size found in the literature, and also as a
discrete character which allows the inclusion of more species [see Additional file 6] since many authors do not provide a mean value but instead offer a description of group
sizes.

We relied upon the recent species level phylogenies provide by May-Collado and Agnarsson (2006) [58] and
May-Collado et al. (2007) [59]. All the main analyses were
made using the preferred tree from May-Collado et al.
(2007) [59] [see Additional file 13]. Because polytomies
can compromise character optimization and tests of character correlations, characters were optimized on a fully
resolved tree, which is the majority rule tree resulting from
a MrBayes analysis (see May-Collado and Agnarsson 2007
for details) [58] without collapsing nodes with less than
50% frequency (using the contype = allcompat option).
However analyses were also run on a range of alternative
phylogenies (see below) Character optimization was performed with the program Mesquite 1.12 [90], using
weighted squared-change parsimony [91].
Acoustic characters were optimized in two data sets (1)
with of all cetacean species and (2) pruning species that
are known not to emit tonal sounds, species for which
acoustic behavior is poorly known, and species that are
known to produce tonal sounds but for which detailed
information for the character under study was not available. When several values were reported in a species for a
particular trait the largest maximum frequency and duration, and the smallest for minimum frequency were used
for the analyses [see values in bold in Additional file 7].
Number of inflection points was analyzed both as continuous, reflecting the continuous nature of the data, but also
as a two and four state discrete character to facilitate additional analyses that require ordinal data (Table 1, [see
Additional files 5 and 9]).
Sociality was optimized as discrete two and four state
characters, and using the social components: group size,
composition, stability and association patterns (Table 1,
[see Additional file 5]). Because several species were polymorphic for one or several characters we optimized species in three ways (1) as polymorphic, (2) emphasizing
their 'highest' social level reported, and (3) emphasizing
their 'lowest' social level reported. Finally, we analyzed
group size as a continuous character.
Independent Contrasts
Assuming group size as a coarse proxy for social complexity (as defined above by Connor 2000) [87] we regressed
it against tonal sound parameters to examine the association of sociality and tonal sound production. Contrasts
were calculated using the method of phylogenetically
independent contrasts [92]. The method takes into
account known dependencies among observations due to
phylogenetic relationship of species, and therefore
reduces error [93]. Independent contrasts were calculated
using the PDAP: PDTREE module [[94], using an unpublished version provided by P. Midford] in Mesquite 1.12
(build h47, 85). To estimate independent contrasts,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/136

branch lengths were used as estimated by MrBayes;
branch length transformations were necessary for group
size (Lack of fit test p < 0.05) and were exponentially
transformed. We also tested the relationship between
tonal sound frequency and complexity [mean number of
inflection points] and tonal sound duration using the
independent contrast method.
Character correlations
We also tested character associations between discrete
characters of sociality and tonal sound complexity using
two different methods. First we used the software SIMMAP 1.0 [95] which allows for multistate character associations. We did the following tests using all post-burnin
trees (n = 2000) from our Bayesian analysis (May-Collado
et al. 2007) [59] using default settings of the program and
employing a rough false discovery rate (FDR) to correct
for multiple simultaneous comparisons (critical p values
for tests of 8, 12, and 16 comparisons are 0.028 (0.972),
0.027 (0.973), and 0.27 (0.973), respectively). We tested
the association of (1) sociality and tonal sound complexity both scored as two state characters, (2) social structure
and tonal complexity scored as four state characters, and
(3) each of the social components and tonal sound complexity scored as two and four states characters [see Additional file 5]. Second using the concentrated changes test
[96] in the software MacClade [97] we tested if changes in
tonal sound complexity were concentrated on social
branches. For this test we used only two state characters.

It is important to note that testing the role (if any) of
sociality in tonal sound evolution is challenging due to
the large gaps in our knowledge of cetacean societies, difficulties of objectively defining tonal sound complexity,
and levels of sociality, and the limitations of available
methods. We note that, as with all of the ordinal data we
use here, the divisions between character states are rather
arbitrary and open to criticism and alternative coding.
Nevertheless we believe that our, be it coarse, phylogenetic approach represents an advance over previous studies that have speculated on social and whistle evolution
using less data and lacking a phylogenetic reference. We
have tried to test the association of characteristics such as
group size and whistle parameters using various different
approaches (independent contrast test, concentrated
changes test, pairwise comparisons on the phylogeny, and
character association test for multistate characters), testing
them across various alternative phylogenies, and our
results are presented in the form of hypotheses that we
hope will subsequently be better tested upon the availability of more data and more sophisticated methods. Also,
importantly, our data highlight gaps in knowledge and
should guide future studies to where allocating resources
might be most beneficial.

Current Knowledge on Cetacean Sociality and Tonal
Sounds
Connor et al. 1998 [86] and Matthews et al. 1999 [83] provided brief reviews of the evolution of sociality in toothed
whales and tonal sounds in cetaceans, respectively. Connor et al. 1998 [86] review highlighted the lack of knowledge for most toothed whale species and focused on the
social structure of a few species including Tursiops truncatus, Orcinus orca, Globicephala spp., Berardius bairdii, Physeter macrocephalus. They compared toothed whale social
structure with some terrestrial mammals e.g. elephants
and chimpanzees, and found both similarities between
the two, but also identified some social elements unique
to toothed whales. Matthews et al. 1999 [83] summarized
the frequency and time parameters of 40 cetacean species
tonal sounds in relation their body size.

This review summarizes information from 335 sources on
sociality and tonal sounds for 64 and 36 Cetacean species,
respectively [see Additional files 5 and 7]. The information was gathered from via searches on Web of Science
and Google Scholar, and include scientific papers in peerreviewed journals, conference abstracts, M.Sc. theses,
Ph.D. dissertations, technical reports to international
organizations, etc.
Although not the main aim of this paper, a few summary
statements can be made about current knowledge of
sociality and tonal sound production in whales [see Additional files 5 and 7]. Baleen whales have a rather uniform
social structure, generally live in simple societies where
animals spend considerable time solitary. Weak associations are limited to aggregations form during the breeding
and feeding time, and long-term associations appear to be
limited to the time mother and calf remained together. In
contrast, toothed whale social structure varies enormously, ranging from solitary to species living in huge
groups. In groups, group members show an array of association patterns, from weak to stable family associations.
For porpoises (Phocoenidae) and several of the freshwater
cetacean species (e.g., Platanista, Lipotes, Inia) authors have
described group member associations as 'undeveloped',
'weak', or 'fluid'. Such description are difficult to interpret
and do not necessarily mean that the authors are suggesting these species live in a fission-fusion society as
reviewed in Connor et al. 1998 [86] for Tursiops truncatus.
For most delphinids, association patterns have been
described as 'fluid', 'highly fluid fussion-fusion', or 'fluid
with short-lasting associations'. In these cases authors
appear to imply by 'fluid' that the species do live in fission-fusion societies [as described by [86]]. In these species males tend to form coalitions and alliances to
'capture' and maintain consortship with females. Finally,
the most stable social structures have been described in
the Sperm whale, (Physeteroidea), most members of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/136

subfamily Globicephalinae, and possibly the Narwhal
(Monodontidae). Notably, these species are not all closely
related so that "stable" societies have evolved convergently, however, species differ in the degree of dispersal
particularly male dispersal from the group.
Our review updates Matthews et al. (1999) [79] review on
Cetacean tonal sounds. We included recently reported
information on species like Delphinus capensis and Sotalia
guianensis [see Additional file 7]. We also updated information on several others like the Narwhal and Beluga
(Monodontidae) and the river dolphins Lipotes and Inia
where more data has become available. The previous
review [83] included tonal sound information from two
beaked whale species (Mesoplodon densirostris, M. carlhubbsi) that we considered controversial due to the possible pulsative nature of these sounds, thus exclude this
information from the table. In addition, Sousa chinensis
and Sousa plumbea were considered here a single species,
since no clear evidence yet exists to separate them into two
distinct species. Likewise, we consider Stenella plagiodon as
a synonym of Stenella frontalis.
Despite of the increasing knowledge on sociality and
tonal sounds the information remains lacking, or scattered, for many species. Here we are highlighting some of
these species, particularly key species in the phylogeny
that would 'resolve' the ambiguities observed in the evolution of sociality and tonal sounds.
Pygmy and Dwarf sperm whales (Kogia breviceps and K.
sima) [98] are close relatives of the Sperm whale (Physeter
macrocephalus) a species that shows a matrilineal society
and does not produce tonal sounds. There are no indications that these species show a similar society to that of
the Sperm whale. In general their social structure and
acoustic signals are poorly known [99-104]. Pygmy and
Dwarf sperm whales are often seen and strand in small
groups that are can be segregated by age and sex or mixed
[102], [see Table 1]. The few published accounts on their
sounds describe click trains [99,101,103] and cry-like
sounds [104] but no tonal sounds.
Beaked Whales (Ziphiidae) are largely unknown. The
social structure of the Northern Bottlenose Whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus) is the best known of all beaked whales
[e.g, [105-109]]. The Baird's Beak Whale (Berardius bairdii)
is believed to live in stable groups where males may perform parental care [e.g., [86,110,111]]. However, other
sources suggest these species live in fission-fusion societies [51]. However both sources report anecdotal evidence
and long-term studies are necessary. The social structure
of other beaked whales is largely unknown. In terms of
tonal sounds, Winn et al. (1970) [112] reported whistles
in H. ampullatus, but it appears to be the general consen-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:136

sus that this species does not produce tonal sounds [e.g.
[109], Whitehead pers. comn. 2005]. Tonal sounds have
been reported as well in the Cuvier's beaked whale,
Ziphius cavirostris by Manghi et al. (1999) [113] but other
acoustic studies only recorded pulsed sounds [e.g.,
[114,115]]. The only beaked whales for which tonal
sounds have been reported are the Baird's Beaked Whale
[52] and the Arnoux's Beaked whale (Berardius arnuxii)
[51]. There is some possibility that the recordings of Dawson et al. (1998) [52] were of a sympatric dolphin species
(Dawson pers. comm.), however, the recordings of Rogers
and Brown (1999) [51] seem conclusive.
Inia, Platanista, Lipotes, Orcaella, Neophocaena live in freshwater environments. Generally riverine species are considered solitary, however in some areas these species are
often seen forming small groups [see Additional file 1 and
respective references]. Although, most authors describe
group member interactions in riverine species as weak,
there is really little knowledge about their societies. In
terms of sound production, like the rest of the family
(Phocoeenidae) [2], Neophocaena does not produce tonal
sounds instead the species emits burst pulses under social
context [2]. Tonal sounds have been described for two of
the subspecies of Inia geoffrensis, Lipotes vexillifer [see Additional file 7], but not for Pontoporia [116]. Mizue et al.
(1971) [117] reported whistles from Platanista gangetica,
recorded in captive conditions. However, it is not clear if
the animals were acoustically isolated from another riverine dolphin (I. geoffrensis), which produces tonal sounds.
The dolphins Lagenorhynchus cruciger, L. australis, Lissodelphis spp, Steno bredanensis, Feresa attenuata, and Peponocephala electra social structure is largely unknown. Most
available information comes from stranding and anecdotic information. Although Fish and Turl (1976) [118]
documented whistles in Lissodelphis spp., recent work did
not find whistles (Oswald pers. comn). No published
accounts on tonal sounds for Feresa and L. cruciger were
found. May-Collado and Agnarsson (2006) [58] predict
that L. cruciger may not emit whistles as it nests within a
clade of species that do not.
Phylogenetic uncertainty
Taking phylogenetic relationships among species into
account is crucial for hypotheses testing in comparative
biology. However, this is no simple procedure – phylogenies themselves are merely hypotheses and for any given
comparative study the number of possible alternative
phylogenetic arrangements grows exponentially with the
number of species being considered. The key question
then becomes, how dependent are our conclusions on the
choice of phylogeny? Do the results remain mostly
unchanged – implying robustness to phylogenetic uncertainty – or do they change when tests are run on alterna-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/136

tive "reasonable" phylogenies. Alternative phylogenies
can come from several sources, e.g. from previously published independent phylogenetic studies, or from the set
of near-optimal trees from a given analysis, e.g. each
unique tree from the post burnin set of a Bayesian analysis. If the results of the comparative analyses are different
under some of the alternative phylogenies we have not
rejected our conclusions but we have been cautioned that
the conclusions are dependent on the chosen phylogeny
and may be altered as new phylogenetic data become
available. If, however, the results are the same across the
set of alternative phylogenies then confidence is gained in
the conclusions. Here, we attempt to account for phylogenetic uncertainty using various approaches.
The total number of trees in the post-burnin set from the
Bayesian analysis is 2000. Instead of basing sensitivity
analyses on the 95% credibility set (which includes a
number of trees that contradict all recent studies of whale
phylogenetics) we use all the post burnin trees filtered
based on various constraints reflecting external phylogenetic evidence. This filtering reduces the number of trees
facilitating analyses, without much risk of compromising
concerns for phylogenetic uncertainty as the constrained
clades are, by any standard, uncontroversial. Rather, considering trees that contradict all available phylogenetic
evidence would seem more likely to be misleading than
useful. Here, we (1) ran analyzes across the post-burnin
set of trees from May-Collado et al. (2007) [59] filtered by
constraining major clades all recent phylogenetic studies
of Cetacea agree have supported (see below), and (2)
using subsets of the post-burnin trees filtered so as to be
congruent with other recently published phylogenetic
hypotheses of cetaceans chosen as they are based on various types of data: morphological/palaentological (Geisler
2003) [119], mitogenomic (Arnason et al. 2004) [53], a
combination of molecular and morphological data (Messenger and McGuire 1998) [61] and SINE's (Nikaido et al.
2001) [62]. We chose to use previously published phylogenies as guides to filter trees from the Bayesian postburnin tree set, rather than to use them directly for analyses (but see below). This is simply because each of these
phylogenies contains only a small subset of cetacean species making them poor for the purposes of comparative
analyses. Nevertheless, they represent relatively well supported and conflicting hypotheses on the interrelationships of some of the major cetacean clades, whose
resolution may impact the findings of our study. Finally,
we ran analyses on trees resulting from re-analyses of the
Messenger and McGuire dataset, which is the most taxonrich previously published phylogeny.
We constructed constraint trees in McClade [see Additional file 2] representing each of the previously published phylogeny (see above) and filtered trees from the

post-burnin set based on these constraint trees. The constraint trees merely reflect the interrelationships of major
clades (families and more inclusive clades, [see Additional
file 2]). Species level relationships are not constrained as
most of the studies include very few species so that they
represent poor tests of lower level phylogenetic structure.
Finally, we produced one constraint tree representing only
clades that all the previously published studies agree on.
This filtering process produced the following datasets:
Arnason constraint set (325 trees), Nikaido constraint set
(341 trees), Messenger and McGuire constraint set (4
trees), and the all study agreement constraint set (1069
trees). None of the post-burnin trees were congruent with
the hypothesis of Geisler (2003) [119]. In fact all other
recent molecular, morphological, and combined analyses
refute aspects of that hypothesis, in particular the monophyly of all river dolphins (other studies all agree that Platanista is not closely related to the remaining river
dolphins), and the monophyly of Physeteroidea (other
studies refute the sister relationships of Ziphiidae and
Physeteridae). Hence we did not further consider that
hypothesis, although it played a role in the construction
of the 'all study agreement' subset.
SIMMAP analyses were run across all trees in each subset,
while PDAP analyses were conducted on the majority rule
tree (using contype = allcompat) of each of the subsets.
Furthermore, parsimony ancestral character reconstructions were examined on each of the majority rule trees and
across all trees from the all study agreement tree subset.

Whistles as a unit for evolutionary analyses. As noted above there are several reasons why using conglomerate concepts like 'whistles' as units of
study can hinder progress in the understanding of sound evolution. Apart
from being rather arbitrarily defined, and hence differently by different
authors, 'whistles' represent a set of characters that may vary independently and may each have different phylogenetic distributions. As a thought
experiment let us think of an example where sound production is being
compared in two sister lineages. Let us assume that some authors are interested in the evolutionary origin of tonal sounds called 'snorts', and that
snorts are defined as narrowband, frequency modulated sounds, with a
contour containing at least two inflection points and frequency above 10
kHz. In group A it is noted that sounds are narrowband, frequency modulated, with three inflection points and frequency ranging from 12–15
kHz. In group B sounds are narrowband, frequency modulated, with a
contour of two inflection points and frequency ranging from 7–9 kHz.
Under a 'broad concept' analysis we would therefore conclude that 'snorts'
were present in A, but absent in B, and might conclude that snorts originated in the common ancestor of A (diagram a). However, this belies both
the similarities and differences that exist in sound production in the two
groups. It denies homology of frequency modulation, contours etc, and
even suggests that tonal sounds evolved independently in each group (as
'snorts' are 'different' tonal sounds from non-snorts). Under a 'component' analysis (diagrams b and c), traits like frequency modulation and
band width would be scored as identical in the two groups – their similarity would be taken as evidence of common ancestry, i.e. homology. Instead
of 'snorts' originating in A, we would more simply explain the differences
between the two groups in terms of frequency, and if e.g., the outgroups
shared the lower frequency (indicated by white branches) of B we would
conclude that a switch to higher frequency (indicated by black branches)
occurred in the common ancestor of A (diagram b). In other words, we
would learn that the difference between what people call 'snorts' and what
they don't call snorts may simply be a matter of sound frequency. In this
latter case there is no indication of tonal sound production being nonhomologous in A and B, and in fact they share most characteristics of the
tonal sounds. Additionally we would learn (diagram c) that inflection
points increased from two (white branches) to three (dark branches) in
the lineage leading to B (supposing the condition in A was shared with the
outgroups). This is information that the concept of 'snorts' obscured. By a
component analysis we learn a lot more than by a concept analysis. If we
now were interested in the association of sounds and sociality, and group
A was social and group B (and outgroups) not, it might be claimed that
'snorts' and 'sociality' are associated and evolved in concert (following diagram a). However, a much more precise and informative conclusion
would be that sociality and sound frequency (diagram b) might be related.
Hence instead of explaining the social context of 'snorts' we would do well
to examine how sound frequency might play an important role in social
communication etc. We believe that 'whistles' are no better justified as a
unit for evolutionary analysis than 'snorts' in the example above. We do
use them in an attempt to test the dolphin hypothesis, but then we opt for
a component approach for most of our analyses.
