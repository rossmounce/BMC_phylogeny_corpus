Abstract
Background: The Chaetognatha (arrow worms) are a group of marine carnivores whose
phylogenetic relationships are still vigorously debated. Molecular studies have as yet failed to come
up with a stable hypothesis on their phylogenetic position. In a wide range of metazoans, the
nervous system has proven to provide a wealth of characters for analysing phylogenetic
relationships (neurophylogeny). Therefore, in the present study we explored the structure of the
ventral nerve centre ("ventral ganglion") in Sagitta setosa with a set of histochemical and
immunohistochemical markers.
Results: In specimens that were immunolabeled for acetylated-alpha tubulin the ventral nerve
centre appeared to be a condensed continuation of the peripheral intraepidermal nerve plexus.
Yet, synapsin immunolocalization showed that the ventral nerve centre is organized into a highly
ordered array of ca. 80 serially arranged microcompartments. Immunohistochemistry against
RFamide revealed a set of serially arranged individually identifiable neurons in the ventral nerve
centre that we charted in detail.
Conclusion: The new information on the structure of the chaetognath nervous system is
compared to previous descriptions of the ventral nerve centre which are critically evaluated. Our
findings are discussed with regard to the debate on nervous system organisation in the last common
bilaterian ancestor and with regard to the phylogenetic affinities of this Chaetognatha. We suggest
to place the Chaetognatha within the Protostomia and argue against hypotheses which propose a
deuterostome affinity of Chaetognatha or a sister-group relationship to all other Bilateria.

Background
The Chaetognatha (arrow worms) are bilaterally symmetrical marine carnivores and among the most abundant
planktonic organisms. To date, about 120 described species are known worldwide from all vertical ranges of the

ocean. Most of them are permanently pelagic but several
epibenthic species are also known [1-3]. The chaetognaths
range in length from 1–120 mm and are characterized by
the presence of horizontally projecting fins and, at the
anterior end, two groups of moveable, cuticular grasping

spines used in capturing prey. Planktonic specimens are
usually glassily transparent. Rapid bursts of swimming
caused by dorso-ventral undulations alternate with phases
during which the animals lie motionless and sink. Chaetognaths are hermaphroditic and develop directly so that
newly hatched larvae display a body organisation that is
in many aspects similar to the adult. Their phylogenetic
affinities are controversial [4,5]. Chaetognaths have traditionally been placed within the Deuterostomes mainly
based on the differentiation of the archenteron seemingly
resembling enterocoeli [reviewed in [1,6-8]]. However,
Kapp [8] emphasizes the phylogenetically isolated position of the Chaetognatha and designates them as incertae
sedis. Nielsen [3,9], on the other hand, unites the Chaetognatha together with the Rotifera and Gnathostomulida in
the taxon Gnathifera thus suggesting a placement within
the Protostomia. Important morphological characters in
this debate are e. g. the coelomic epithelia and coelom formation [6,10-12]. Chaetognath cleavage has traditionally
been perceived as "radial" and thus as suggesting a deuterostome affinity [discussed in [13]]. However, a recent
marking experiment of the first cleavage stages shows a
spiral cleavage configuration of the four cell stage thereby
suggesting a protostomian relationship [13]. A position
within the Protostomia is also supported by ultrastructural features of the brain [14] and by analyses of the
genes that code for intermediate filament proteins
[15,16].
General information on the chaetognath morphology and
anatomy has been summarised in the classical, histological contributions by Hertwig [17], Kuhl [18] and more
recently in reviews by Goto and Yoshida [19], Bone and
Goto [20], Kapp [1,21], Nielsen [3], and Ax [22]; the most
detailed review of their anatomy is probably that of Shinn
[2]. Chaetognaths have a complex nervous system that is
largely epidermal. The general organisation of their nervous system has been examined by Bone and Pulsford [23],
and Goto and Yoshida [[19,24]; reviews [2,20]; see Fig.
2A, B]. More specifically, the fine structure of the brain has
received much attention [14,19,25,26]. The layout of the
neuromuscular innervation [27] and the ultrastructure of
neuromuscular junctions [28] have been described. Much
attention has also been focused on sensory organs such as
ciliated receptor neurons [23,29-32], the eyes [24,33-35],
and conjunction with this also on mechanisms of positive
phototactical behaviours [36,37]. Three studies have used
immunohistochemical techniques to examine the distribution of serotonin and RFamide-like immunoreactive
neurons [27,38] and aspartate immunoreactivity [39] in
the central and peripheral parts of the nervous systems.
Systematic analyses of DNA sequences have as yet failed to
support an unambiguous hypothesis on chaetognath
affinities (summarized in Fig. 1). Wada and Satoh [40]

clearly excluded the Chaetognatha from the Deuterostomia in an analysis based on 18S rDNA sequence. In a
study also based on 18S rDNA, Telford and Holland [41]
proposed a most likely position of the chaetognaths as
descendants from an early metazoan branch possibly
originating prior to the radiation of the major coelomate
groups. Halanych [42] (18S rDNA) suggested a chaetognath-nematode relationship but did not include Nematomorpha and Gastrotricha into his analysis. He recognised
long-branch attraction as a possible source of error but
tried to minimise this error by a four-taxon analysis. Telford and Holland [43] reported the unusual finding of
two distinct classes of 28S rDNA in chaetognaths both of
which diverge strongly from other Metazoa. Based on 18S
rRNA sequence analysis, Littlewood et al. [44] suggested a
sister-group relationship of Chaetognatha and Gnathostomulida. They also proposed the Nematoda as the adelpho taxon to Chaetognatha + Gnathostomulida. Zrzavý et
al. al. [45] combined morphological and 18S rDNA sets in
a cladistic analysis which suggested a grouping of Onychophora + (Tardigrada + Arthropoda) to be the sister
group of chaetognaths. Giribet et al. [46] also combined
18S rDNA data of 145 terminal taxa with 276 morphological characters in a total evidence regime. This analysis
yielded a sister-group relationship of Chaetognatha with
Nemertodermatida that the authors qualified as unstable
and difficult to justify on the basis of morphological/anatomical characters. Peterson and Eernisse [47] analysed
with maximum parsimony 138 morphological characters
from 40 metazoan groups and 304 18S rDNA sequences
(Fig. 8). Their analyses placed the Chaetognatha within
the Ecdysozoa and here within the Nematoida similar to
the result of Halanych [42]. However, this position was
unstable so that the authors "suspect that this placement
is potentially artifactual, and are unaware of any morphological synapomorphies shared exclusively by chaetognaths and either nematodes or nematomorphs." They
conclude: "Given that chaetognaths have other bilaterian
plesiomorphies not found in other ecdysozoans, we suggest that they are more likely basal to the other ecdysozoan clades". Mallatt and Winchell [48] combined largesubunit and small-subunit rRNA sequences. Their chaetognath sequence associated with that of an onychophoran, but this was considered by the authors as unstable
and probably due to long-branch attraction. Papillon et
al. [49] isolated six Hox genes from a chaetognath one of
which possessed a mosaic Homeodomain sequence,
which in the author's view provided evidence that the
Chaetognatha could be an early off-shoot of the triploblastic lineage that predates the deuterostome/protostome
split. Helfenbein et al. [50] analysed the complete mitochondrial genome of a representative of the Chaetognatha, Paraspadella gotoi (Spadellidae). Their analysis
showed that the organisation of the genes in the mtDNA
is distinctive among metazoan mtDNAs and that chaetog-

naths miss many of the mtDNA genes commonly found
in other Metazoa. Comparisons of amino acid sequences
from mitochondrially encoded proteins in their analysis
yielded one single most parsimonious tree that suggests a
position of the Chaetognatha as a sister group to the Protostomia [50]. Papillon et al. [51] also analysed the mitochondrial genome of a member of the Spadellidae
(Spadella cephaloptera). Contrary to the analysis of Helfenbein et al. [51], they placed the arrow worms within the
Protostomia and assigned them to the lophotrochozoan
clade. Two new papers complete this highly divergent picture. Matus et al. [52] in a Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analysis of a 56 taxon metazoan
tropomyosin data set and 72 genes from ESTs suggest a
sister-group relationship of Chaetognatha to the Lophotrochozoa whereas Marlétaz et al. [53] in a maximum likelihood and bayesian inference tree based on the analysis
of a concentrated 79 proteins and 11,667 positions ribosomal protein data set proposed a sister-group relationship
of Chaetognatha to all Protostomia.
Clearly, the phylogenetic position of arrow worms is
unstable in both morphological and molecular studies.
Yet, the recent molecular studies on mitochondrial
genomes and ESTs seem to favor a position within or close
to the Protostomia. Structure and development of the
nervous system have always provided strong and important arguments in the discussion on metazoan phylogeny
("neurophylogeny") [54]. Recent examples are the evolution from nerve nets to more centralised nervous systems
[55,56], the impact of apical organs, ciliary bands and serotonergic neurons on our understanding of bilaterian
evolution [57-59], the fundamental phylogenetic relationships within the Arthropoda [60-62], a possible dorsoventral axis inversion during evolution towards the
vertebrate CNS [55,63,64], or the structure of the ancestral
bilaterian and chordate brain [65-69]. In the light of the
conflicting hypotheses on chaetognath phylogeny, the
current paper sets out to give a brief overview over the previous knowledge of the structure of the chaetognath nervous system and to explore the structure of the ventral
ganglion in more detail than has been available so far.
One main goal of our study was to add a new set of neuroanatomical characters to the discussion on the phylogenetic position of the Chaetognatha. Furthermore, with
these data we want to contribute to the debate of how the
nervous system of the last common ancester of the Bilateria may have looked like [56,64,68,70].

Results
Structure of the chaetognath central nervous system:
current knowledge
A brief description of the layout of the adult arrow worm
central nervous system will serve as the basis for illustrating our own results. It consists of six ganglia in the head,

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/14

one unpaired ventral ganglion in the body, nerve tracts
connecting these ganglia and peripheral nerves passing
out of these ganglia [2,19,20] (Fig. 2). The ganglia in the
head are the cerebral ganglion (the brain), a pair of vestibular ganglia, a pair of oesophageal ganglia, and a
suboesophageal ganglion (Fig. 2A, B). The brain is located
immediately below the surface epithelium of the head
and consists of a neuropil core with numerous synapses
surrounded by a layer of neuronal cell somata [14,19,20].
Connective nerve tracts are found between the cerebral
and the vestibular, the cerebral and the ventral, and the
vestibular and the oesophageal ganglia. A commissural
nerve bundle behind the oesophagus connects the vestibular ganglia. The anterio-posteriorly running nerves
which connect the cerebral and the ventral ganglia are
called the main connectives, and those which connect the
cerebral and the vestibular ganglia, the frontal connectives
[19]. Sensory organs associated with the brain are a pair of
eyes [24,33-35], a ciliated loop, the corona ciliata, localised in the dorsal part of the head [2,20,29-32] and the
retrocerebral organ, a structure with an unknown putative
sensory function [2].
The ventral ganglion is an elongate structure lying
between the basement membrane and the epidermis. Two
main connectives link it with the brain ganglia and two
other nerve tracts continue caudally (Fig. 2A, B) [19,23].
Similar to the brain, the ventral ganglion consists of a central fibrillar neuropil core, flanked by lateral clusters of
cell bodies [2,19,20]. Along the length of the ventral ganglion a series of smaller nerves pass out radially (Fig. 2A,
B) which branch in the periphery and form a dense ramifying plexus just external to the basement membrane to
provide motor innervation to the body musculature and
to innervate the ciliary fence receptors [23]. The ventral
ganglion controls swimming by initiating contractions of
the body wall musculature and co-ordinating mechanosensory input from the numerous ciliary fence receptors in
the epidermis [2,20,23]. The available descriptions of the
lateral nerves that exit the ventral ganglion in closely
related species of the genus Sagitta display a remarkable
degree of variability over the last 125 years. Hertwig [17]
described an irregular array of nerve fibres ("Nervenfibrillen") to emerge from the ventral ganglion (Fig. 2C). Kuhl
[18], presenting a modified drawing from Burfield [71],
depicts 12 distinct, stout nerve trunks to exit the ganglion
on both sides (Fig. 2D). Yet, Goto and Yoshida [19] draw
only six radial nerves on each side (Fig. 2B). In Shin [2],
again, 12 bilaterally arranged radial nerves exit the ganglion on both sides in a nicely ordered way, much like the
arrangement of the segmental nerves in the ventral nerve
cord of an annelid or arthropod (Fig. 2E). In the same
year, Duvert et al. [39] published a report in which they
described 20 – 30 irregularly arranged aspartate-immunoreactive fibre bundles that pass out radially from the ven-

tral ganglion on both sides and spread out diffusely and

provided by Hertwig [17].
The structure of the ventral ganglion as revealed by the
histochemical localization of actin and a nuclear marker
In whole mounts of juvenile Sagitta sp. that were processed with the nuclear marker bisbenzimide the general
arrangement of the ventral ganglion is visible (Fig. 3A).
Scattered concentrations of nuclei on the body surface
mark the location of ciliary fence receptors (arrows in Fig.
3A). Double labelling with bisbenzimide and phallotoxins to visualize actin shows that the ventral ganglion is
composed of a central neuropil core that has a rectangular, elongated shape and contains longitudinal fibre tracts

(Fig. 3B, C). The neuropil core is on both sides flanked by
coherent zones of small (ca. 10 μm) neuronal cell somata
(ganglion cells; Fig. 3B, C). Most of these somata are
restricted to the sides of the ganglion rather than being
located dorsally or ventrally to the neuropil. Fibre bundles
that emerge from the cells in the lateral clusters approach
the neuropil core from a lateral direction (Fig. 3D'). The
ganglion cell somata appear to be arranged in rows
between those fibre bundles (Fig. 3D"; and Fig. 6C). At the
lateral margins of the soma clusters, large cell bodies are
interspersed between the smaller ganglion cells at regular
intervals (asterisks in Fig. 6D). These large ganglion cells
were already recognized by Hertwig ("große Ganglienzellen" [17]) and also in later studies using methylene blue
staining techniques [23,27].

known to be involved in the control of muscle contractions [23,28,72]. The network consists of fibres of various
sizes many of which extend in a roughly anterior-posterior direction but many transverse fibres are also present
(Fig. 4B). Some of the fibres have a beaded appearance
suggesting the presence of synaptic varicosities. Our preparations show that the ciliary fence receptors which are
also strongly immunolabelled are innervated by tiny
branches of the fibre network (arrows in Fig. 4A) suggesting a sensory function of the intraepidermal plexus in
addition to the known role in motor control. Hertwig [17]

and Bone and Goto [20] observed numerous multipolar
neurons associated with the fibres of the intraepidermal
plexus. Tubulin immunolocalization revealed conspicuous small concentrations of labelled material (arrows in
Fig. 4B) that may correspond to these peripheral neurons
but we failed to establish the identity of these concentrations with sufficient certainty.
An irregular array of ca. 20 – 30 tubulin-labelled fibres
and fibre bundles emerges laterally from both sides of the
ventral ganglion (Fig. 4C, D). These bundles contribute to
and are confluent with the peripheral nerve plexus. We
did not notice a regularly ordered spacing or distinct bilaterally symmetrical arrangement of these radial nerve bundles as earlier reports had indicated [2,19]. Rather, our
findings resemble the pattern of aspartate-immunoreactive fibre bundles that pass out from the ventral ganglion
as described by Duvert et al. [39]. Caudally, two thick
bundles of tubulin-labelled fibres emerge from the ganglion to connect it to the intraepidermal nerve plexus in
the posterior part of the animal (Fig. 4C). These caudal
bundles are superficially similar to the radial fibre bundles, yet they contain more closely packed neurites. In
summary, in tubulin-labelled preparations the ventral
ganglion very much appears to be a condensed continuation of the peripheral intraepidermal nerve plexus.
Synapsin immunoreactivity: the ventral ganglion as a
highly ordered structure
Immunohistochemistry with the SYNORF 1 antibody
(Fig. 5) that is directed against presynaptic proteins
reveals an overall shape of the synaptic neuropil core in
adult Sagitta setosa that is similar to that in specimens
labelled for actin (Fig. 3B). Clearly, synaptic contacts are
confined to the central neuropil whereas the lateral soma
regions are devoid of synapses. Synapsin labelling is weak
at the anterior and posterior ends of the ventral ganglion
suggesting the presence of more fibre tracts than synaptic
neuropil in these areas. Interestingly, synapsin immunolocalization reveals a strikingly different picture of the
ventral ganglion than tubulin immunohistochemistry
("unorganized nerve plexus") in that it shows a highly
ordered subdivision of the neuropil core into serially
arranged compartments. The ganglion seems to be composed of an anterior-posterior sequence of ca. 80 transverse microcompartments (Fig. 5, 6A, B). At higher
magnification it becomes apparent that, overlying the pattern of microcompartments, synapsin immunolabelling is
particularly strong in a lateral longitudinal stripe on both
sides of the neuropil whereas a narrow medial longitudinal stripe is devoid of labelling (Fig. 6A, B). Yet, at a
slightly more ventral focus level, synapsin immunoreactivity is more evenly distributed across the neuropil core
and microcompartments are not visible (Fig. 6B). A comparable serial arrangement of nervous elements in the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/14

chaeotognath nervous system so far has been reported in
only one other study. Bone and Pulsford [23], using methylene blue and reduced silver staining techniques, provided evidence for the presence of many serially arranged
transverse fibres that cross the neuropil core.
RFamide-like immunoreactivity: individually identifiable
neurons
In addition to synapsin labelling, immunohistochemistry
against RFamide provides further evidence for serially
arranged nervous elements in the ventral ganglion of Sagitta setosa (Fig. 6E–G). RFamide immunoreactive neurons
previously have been described in Sagitta setosa [27] and
Paraspadella gotoi [38], yet these authors did not map the
labelling pattern in greater detail. Our study provides conclusive evidence for the presence of individually identifiable neurons in Chaetognatha that can be homologized
between different specimens (Fig. 7). Double labelling
that combined RFamide immunolocalization with synapsin immunohistochemistry (Fig. 6E) or a nuclear
marker (Fig. 6F, G) showed that within the lateral soma
zones the cell bodies of the RFamidergic neurons are
located mostly close to the interface between the neuropil
core and the soma clusters whereas longitudinal RFamidergic fibre tracts are restricted to the ganglion core (Fig.
6E). In Fig. 7, photomontages of the complete ventral ganglia (whole mounts) of two specimens are shown to illustrate the full extent of the RFamidergic system. The
labelling pattern was consistent among the more than 20
specimens that we examined. Anteriorly, typically three
fibres are present within both main connectives (CO) that
link the ventral ganglion to the brain (Fig. 7, 8H, I). Three
main longitudinal tracts of RFamide immunolabelled
fibres can be distinguished: the medial bundle (MB), the
bilaterally paired intermediate bundles (IB), and the
paired lateral bundles (LB; Fig. 6G, 7B, 8A) that run along
the lateral borders of the neuropil cores as double labelling with the synapsin marker shows (Fig. 6E). All fibres
within these longitudinal tracts have a typical beaded
appearance. One of the fibres that enter the ganglion anteriorly crosses the midline close to the entry point of the
main connectives to join the medial bundle (solid arrow
in Fig. 8H). The second fibre in the main connectives is
also associated with the medial bundle whereas the third
one joins the intermediate bundle (Fig. 8H, I). In the anterior part of the ganglion, fibres in the intermediate bundle
run towards the midline and seem to cross over the
median nerve bundle towards the contralateral side (Fig.
7, and open arrows in Fig. 8H, I). In contrast to the observations by Goto et al. [38] on Paraspadella gotoi, we did not
record any RFamidergic fibres that leave the ventral ganglion posteriorly.

The RFamidergic neurons, all of which are unipolar, can
be subdivided into two different populations: a first series

analysed specimens and hence represent typical examples
for individually identifiable, bilateral symmetrically

morphology and appear to be serially repeated clones.

the neuropil core at a right angle to the anterior-posterior
axis (Fig. 6G, 8B, C). The neurites of cells D1–D5 all cross
over the lateral longitudinal bundle to join the intermediate bundle. The intermediate longitudinal bundle is composed of an inner and an outer portion (Fig. 8C). The
neurites of cells D1–D5 (and also of D6; Fig. 8E) consistently contact the inner fibres of the intermediate bundle
which is another indication of their serial identity (arrows
in Fig. 8C). In some specimens, the presence of faintly
immunolabelled material suggested the neurites of some
D neurons to proceed even more medially to join the
medial bundle. Screening these regions with high-magnification laser-scan microscopy did not provide conclusive
evidence that this is the case (inset in Fig. 8D, arrow).

The ventral ganglion is a condensation of the
intraepidermal nerve plexus
A conspicuous feature of the chaetognaths is that in addition to the central part of the nervous system, a peripheral
part is present which is exclusively intraepidermal
[2,19,20,39] and which mediates motor innervation to
the body musculature and innervates the ciliary fence
receptors [23]. By using anti-aspartate immunohistochemistry, Duvert et al. [39] visualized this extensive
intraepidermal nerve plexuses both in the head region
and in the trunk. In the trunk, muscle contraction seems
to be controlled by this profuse intraepidermal network
[23,28,67]. Compared to other Bilateria, an unusual feature of the arrow worm neuromuscular system is that in
the trunk axonal varicosities lack specialized junctions
and are separated from underlying muscles by a thick connective stratum. Acetylcholine is the major neuromuscular transmitter, which reaches muscle cells in the trunk by
diffusion through the intervening body wall extracellular
matrix [2,20]. Acetylcholinergic fibres deliver their transmitter by boutons that in the trunk region terminate on
the epidermis side of the connective stratum and therefore
diffusely bath the muscle cells with acetylcholine [27,39].
It should be noted, however, that in the head, nervous
fibres which target oesophageal and somatic head muscles, have conventional nerve endings and neuromuscular
junctions that display ultrastructural features similar to
classic motor end plates [2,28].

Our experiments on tubulin immunolocalization confirm
and extend the observations on the structure of the
peripheral plexus and ventral ganglion already published
by Hertwig [17]. We showed an irregular array of ca. 20 –
30 fibres and fibre bundles to emerge laterally from both
sides of the ventral ganglion. These fibres pass out radially
to spread out diffusely and branch in the periphery thus
being a major source for the peripheral nerve plexus.
Duvert et al. [39] described a similar irregular array of
aspartate-immunoreactive fibre bundles to spread out

ganglion with the internalized ventral nerve cords of e.g.
annelids or arthropods that have segmentally arranged
nerves projecting into the periphery. Rather, the arrow
worm ventral ganglion appears to be a condensation of
the intraepidermal nerve plexus. Hertwig [17] and Bone
and Goto [20] observed numerous multipolar neurons to
be embedded within the intraepidermal plexus. These
neurons in the plexus may be the evolutionary precursors
of the lateral clusters of cell bodies that flank the central
fibrillar neuropil core of the ventral ganglion. During the
emergence of Protostomia, the neurons in the plexus may
have aggregated to form the centralized nerve centres that
we observe in the Protostomia (Fig. 1).
Considering its role to coordinate sensory input from the
fence receptors and efferent control of the trunk muscles
for swimming behavior, Bone and Goto [20] proposed
the ventral ganglion to be part of the central nervous system. From a histological point of view, the ventral ganglion can be seen as a condensation of the epidermal
nerve plexus that displays a high degree of centralization.
It represents a centralized, yet peripherally located center
for complex sensory-motor integration. It is important to
note that the chaetognath ventral ganglion is not internalized such as the subepidermal ganglia of Annelida,
Arthropoda and Mollusca but remains in an intraepidermal position. It appears that, compared to other Protostomia, the Chaetognatha, by transforming a diffuse nerve
net to a more centralized neuronal structure, followed
their own distinct evolutionary pathway to generate a ventral nervous center in the trunk for sensory integration and
motor control. Therefore, it may be appropriate to term
this structure "ventral nerve centre" in order to stress the
difference to ventral ganglia of other Protostomia. We suggest that this centralized nerve centre with its specific
architecture and intraepidermal location is an autapomorphy of Chaetognatha.

distinct, bilaterally arranged radial nerves exit the ganglion on both sides in a serially ordered way. Our findings
therefore defy any similarities of the chaetognath ventral

The serial organization of the ventral nerve centre
Despite the suggested origin of the ventral nerve centre
from the peripheral nerve net its central neuropil core displays a high degree of internal organization. Synapsin
immunolocalization revealed a highly ordered system of
serially arranged synaptic microcompartments in the ganglion core. This compartmentalization may anatomically
be linked to a system of serially arranged transverse fibres
that cross the neuropil core as reported by Bone and Pulsford [23]. It does not have any equivalent in the ventral
ganglia of other Protostomia [73-78] and can be considered another autapomorphy of the chaetognath ventral
nerve centre. Our data on the immunolocalization of the
neuropeptide RFamide provide further evidence for serially arranged nervous elements in the ventral nerve centre
of Sagitta setosa and extend previous reports on the localization of this substance in Sagitta setosa [27] and Paras-

padella gotoi [38]. Most importantly, we provide evidence
for serially arranged, individually identifiable neurons
that can be homologized between different specimens.
Although Goto et al. [38] (their Fig. 1d) did not map the
pattern of RFamide-immunoreactive neurons in the ventral nerve centre of Paraspadella gotoi in detail, a comparison with our data nevertheless suggests that some of the L
and D neurons may be evolutionary conserved across different chaetognath species. Papillon et al. [79] described
the median Hox gene SceMed4 in embryos and early
hatchlings of Spadella cephaloptera. This gene is expressed
in two lateral stripes in the middle of the developing ventral nerve centre. The SceMed4 mRNA is localized in the
bilateral soma clusters but not in the neuropil. These
authors suggested that this gene may contribute to the
diversity of neuronal subpopulations and to the establishment of distinct axon projection patterns [79]. It would be
interesting to explore the expression of this gene in the
organism that we studied, Sagitta setosa, to see if the region
of expression coincided e.g. with the anterior-posterior
transition from the "L" to the "D" type of RFamidergic
neurons that we describe in the current study.
Individually identifiable neurons (see [80] for a discussion of this concept) seem to be present in the nervous
systems of all major taxa within the Protostomia: e.g.
Arthropoda [60,61], Annelida [74,77,78,81-83], Nemathelminthes/Cycloneuralia
[84,85],
basal
Mollusca
[73,74,86], Plathelminthes [87-89], and Gnathostomulida [90]. Therefore, we suggest that developmental programmes generating neurons with an individual identity
must be present in the ground pattern of the Protostomia.
A serial arrangement of individual nerve cells cannot only
be found in protostomians with typical segmentation
such as annelids and arthropods [60,77,78], but also in
unsegmented organisms such as Nematoda [85],
Plathelminthes [87-89], Chaetognatha (present report),
and in organisms the segmental organization of which is
unclear such as basal Mollusca [73,86,91]. Our concepts
of segmentation in Protostomia mainly rely on work done
in annelids and arthropods (reviews e.g. [92,93]). Budd
[92] points out that "because segmentation is an evolutionary feature, it must have been acquired in a series of
functional intermediates, and the sudden imposition of
eusegmentation on a non-segmental precursor seems
highly unlikely." In this view, the organization of individual organ systems such as the central nervous system (but
not the entire organism) into serially repeated structures
may be the starting point in an evolutionary trajectory
from which segmentation as we see it in annelids and
arthropods emerged [92].

Evolution of the bilaterian nervous system and the position
of Chaetognatha
An intraepidermal nerve plexus is a prominent feature of
many basal deuterostomes [55,68]. It is present e.g. in
enteropneusts [94], in urochordates such as tunicates
[95], and in the basal chordate Amphioxus [96]. An extensive intraepidermal nervous system also characterizes
many Protostomia [3,55]. Recent investigations on Annelida [77,78,81] and Onychophora (basal arthropods;
Mayer and Harzsch, unpublished data) provide new evidence that, in addition to the internalized parts of the
nervous system, the peripheral plexus is a prominent feature in these organisms that seem to have retained more
motifs of a flatworm-like orthogonal nervous system than
has been perceived before. It has recently been proposed
that an epithelial (epidermal) nerve plexus (as is also
present in Cnidaria; [97-99]) without concentrations into
longitudinal cords characterizes the ground pattern of
Bilateria [56,64,65] (Fig. 1). Yet, the presence of at least
some individually identifiable neurons in basal deuterostomes such as tunicates (Urochordata; [100-102]), and
the lancelet Amphioxus (Chordata; [96]) indicates that the
potential to establish individual identities of the neurons
in the plexus may not only be present in the ground pattern of Protostomia (see above) but may date back to the
ground pattern of Bilateria (Fig. 1).

The evolution of the deuterostome nervous system is a
field of intense research [56,63-66,95,96,103-107] but it
is beyond the scope of this contribution to embark into
this issue. For the Protostomia, Nielsen [3,58] suggested
that a perioral/circumesophageal brain in addition to the
intraepidermal nerve plexus characterizes their ground
pattern (Fig. 1). Such a circumoral brain can be recognized in most protostomian groups (e.g. [3] Fig. 12.2
therein; and [61,71]) and is by Nielsen [3,58] considered
to be one of the key apomorphies of the Protostomia that
may have evolved from a circumoral concentration of
nerve cells around the mouth as present in Cnidaria. The
brain components in Chaetognatha are also arranged in
such a typical circumoral pattern (compare Fig. 2).

Conclusion
In summary, we suggest that in the ground pattern of Protostomia, the nervous system is characterized by the following features (see Fig. 1):
• An extensive intraepidermal plexus (plesiomorphic)
• The developmental programme to establish individual
identities of neurons (plesiomorphic?)
• A circumoral brain ring (apomorphic)

Page 11 of 15

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:14

• Most likely several longitudinal fibre tracts that are
embedded within the peripheral plexus (apomorphic?)
• Ventral centralizations of the plexus that are linked to
the brain by longitudinal tracts (apomorphic; "ventral"
being the "chordin" expressing side in Protostomia; Lowe
et al. 2006)
We conclude that the nervous system architecture of Chaetognatha including ultrastructural features [14] places
them within the Protostomia (see also [3]). Phylogenetic
affinities of the Chaetognatha to Deuterostomia in our
view can be ruled out as well as molecular hypotheses that
suggest a sister-group relationship to all other Bilateria
[43,49] and, to date, we consider a sister-group relationship of Chaetognatha and Protostomia [46,50] to be
unlikely. Based on the differences of the arrow worm
brain to the collar-like shape of the typical cycloneuralian
brain in Nematoda, we also believe that it is unlikely that
Nematoda are the sister-group of Chaetognatha [42,47].
More detailed analyses of the arrow worm ventral nerve
centre and especially the brain including studies on neurogenesis will be necessary to explore any potential affinities of this group to specific taxa within the Protostomia.

Methods
Experimental animals
Juvenile specimens of an unidentified species of the genus
Sagitta were obtained from the coastal waters around the
Mediterranean island Ibiza (Spain) in March 2006. A
plankton net was towed across the surface waters of the
Cala Llenya, Cala Vadella, Penyal de s'Aguila, and the
Punta Grassio. Adult specimens of Sagitta setosa were
obtained during a collection trip to the Biologische
Anstalt Helgoland, German Bight http://www.awibremerhaven.de/BAH/ in August 2006. Specimens were
obtained by horizontal (surface water samples) as well as
by vertical (down to 20 meters depth) plankton hauls
with the research vessel "MS Aade".
Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry
Specimens were fixed overnight at 4°C (or for 4 h, room
temperature) in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (PB; 0,1 M, pH 7.4). Histochemistry and
immunohistochemistry were carried on free-floating
whole mounts of adult specimens with fluorochromeconjugated secondary antibodies using standard protocols. After fixation the tissues were washed in several
changes of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for at least 4
h, preincubated in PBS-TX (1% normal goat serum, 0,3%
Triton X-100, 0,05% Na-acide) for 1 h and then incubated
overnight in the following histochemical reagents and primary antibodies diluted in PBS-TX (room temperature):

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/14

• Phalloidin Alexa 488 (1:50; probe for actin; see e.g.
[108]; Molecular Probes, obtained from MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany)
• anti-acetylated alpha-tubulin from mouse (Sigma 1:100;
see e.g. [109]).
• anti-FMRFamide from rabbit (1:1000; Diasorin; see e.g.
[110]).
• anti-synapsin SYNORF 1 from mouse (1:10; [111]; antibody kindly provided by Prof. Dr. E. Buchner, Universität
Würzburg)
For double labelling, combinations of these antisera were
used, or the specimens were stained with the nuclear dye
bisbenzimide (0.1%, 15 min. at room temperature;
Hoechst H 33258), prior to the antibody incubations.
Specimens were then washed for at least 2 h in several
changes of PBS and subsequently incubated in secondary
antibodies against mouse and rabbit proteins conjugated
to the fluorochrome Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes,
obtained by MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) for 4 hours.
Finally the tissues were washed for at least 2 h in several
changes of PBS and mounted in GelMount (Sigma). In
control experiments, the omission of primary antibodies
resulted in the absence of any neuronal labelling.
Microscopic analysis
Digital images were obtained with a Zeiss Axioskop fitted
with a CCD-1300B digital camera (Vosskühler GmbH)
and processed with the Lucia Measurement 5.0 software
package (Laboratory Imaging Ltd.). Alternatively, samples
were scanned with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laserscanning microscope (Lichtmikroskopiezentrum, Institut
für Zellbiologie und Biosystemtechnik, Universität Rostock). Those images are based on stacks of between 15 and
20 optical sections (single images are averages of four
laser sweeps) of a z-series taken at intervals of 1 μm.
