Abstract
Background: Flavonol glucosides constitute the second group of secondary metabolites that
accumulate in Crocus sativus stigmas. To date there are no reports of functionally characterized
flavonoid glucosyltransferases in C. sativus, despite the importance of these compounds as
antioxidant agents. Moreover, their bitter taste makes them excellent candidates for consideration
as potential organoleptic agents of saffron spice, the dry stigmas of C. sativus.
Results: Using degenerate primers designed to match the plant secondary product
glucosyltransferase (PSPG) box we cloned a full length cDNA encoding CsGT45 from C. sativus
stigmas. This protein showed homology with flavonoid glucosyltransferases. In vitro reactions
showed that CsGT45 catalyses the transfer of glucose from UDP_glucose to kaempferol and
quercetin. Kaempferol is the unique flavonol present in C. sativus stigmas and the levels of its
glucosides changed during stigma development, and these changes, are correlated with the
expression levels of CsGT45 during these developmental stages.
Conclusion: Findings presented here suggest that CsGT45 is an active enzyme that plays a role in
the formation of flavonoid glucosides in C. sativus.

Background
Flavonols constitute a major class of plant natural products that accumulate in a wide range of conjugate structures. A large proportion of this diversity is due to the
attachment of one or several sugar moieties at different
positions. Besides providing beautiful pigmentation in
flowers, fruits, seeds, and leaves [1], flavonoids also have
key roles in signalling between plants and microbes, in
male fertility of some species [2], in defence as antimicrobial agents and feeding deterrents [3], in UV protection

[4], in the regulation of polar transport of auxins [5], and
more recently, their role in cell cycle regulation in plants
has been demonstrated [6,7]. There is increasing evidence
to suggest that flavonoids, in particular those belonging to
the class of flavonols (such as kaempferol and quercetin),
are potentially health-protecting components in the
human diet as a result of their high antioxidant capacity
[8,9]. Therefore, flavonoids may offer protection against
major diseases such as coronary heart diseases and cancer
[10,11]. Flavonoids are present at relatively high concen-

trations in saffron, the dessicated stigma tissue of C. sativus [12,13]. Their antioxidant properties, along with their
bitter taste, could qualify them as potential organoleptic
agents of the spice [13-15]. In addition, they show anticonceptive and anti-inflammatory effects [16]. Nevertheless, the studies of these compounds in saffron stigma are
scarce, and have only been analysed with some detail in
tepals [17,18].
Flavonoid synthesis is organ- and tissue-dependent, and is
affected by environmental conditions [19]. In the early
steps of flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine derived
from the shikimic acid pathway is converted to coumaroyl-CoA by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate
4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase. Chalcone
synthase, the first committed enzyme for flavonoid biosynthesis, results in the condensation of coumaroyl-CoA
with three molecules of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA to
form naringenin chalcone, which suffers further modifications that result in the synthesis of substitute flavones, flavonols, catechins, deoxyflavonoids, and anthocyanins.
The flavonoid aglycones, which have a variety of glycosylation sites, are converted into glycon by glycosyltransferases.
In higher plants, secondary metabolites are often converted to their glycoconjugates, which are then accumulated and compartmentalized in vacuoles [20], while
glycosylation of phytochemicals is known to alter their
regulatory properties by causing enhanced water solubility and lower chemical reactivity. Glycosylation involves a
UGT-catalysed transfer of a nucleotide diphosphate-activated sugar molecule to the acceptor aglycone [21]. The
glycosylation reactions are catalysed by glycosyltransferases (GTases). Among these GTases, family 1 GTases
(UGTs), commonly utilize small molecular weight compounds as acceptor molecule substrates and UDP-sugars
as donors [22]. The first gene encoding a plant glycosyltransferase was isolated in Zea mays, during the analysis of
the Bronze locus, which codes for an UDP-glucose:flavonol glucosyltransferase [23]. Since then, several clones
have been characterized at a molecular level in a range of
species including Petunia hybrida [24,25], Vitis vinifera
[26], Perilla frutescens [27], Allium cepa [28], Nicotiana tabacum [29], Arabidopsis thaliana [30-34], Dianthus caryophyllus [35], Beta vulgaris [36], Glycine max [37]; Pyrus
communis [38], Oryza sativa [39,40] and Fragaria × ananassa [41] among others.
Here the isolation of a UDP-glucose:flavonol glucosyltransferase from C. sativus stigmas using a degenerate PCR
technique is reported. The substrate specificity analyses
using recombinant protein indicated that C. sativus flavonol GT, CsGT45, was able to catalyse glucosylation of
kaempferol and quercetin. Interestingly, CsGT45 was not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/109

expressed in Crocus species unable to accumulate kaempferol 7-O-glucosides in stigmas, suggesting the involvement of CsGT45 in the formation of kaempferol
glucosides in the stigma tissue of C. sativus.

Results
Profile of flavonols accumulation during stigma tissue
development
In saffron, the flavonoids kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7O-glucopyranoside and kaempferol 7-O-sophoroside
were identified as abundant compounds [12,13], and
more recently, a kaempferol tetrahexoside and kaempferol 3,7,4'-triglucoside have been tentatively identified as
minor flavonoids in saffron [15], whereas quercetin and
its glucosides have not been detected. Initially the content
of flavonoids present in C. sativus stigma at anthesis was
analysed by LC-ESI-MS (Figure 1A). In addition, six
stigma developmental stages were selected and methanol
extracts were analysed by HPLC. Under our experimental
conditions, three significant flavonoids were evident in
the HPLC chromatograms from extracts of C. sativus stigmas (Figure 1A). The retention times, the UV spectra and
the LC-ESI-MS analysis on stigmas at anthesis allowed us
to tentatively identify these flavonoids as 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucopyranoside, 3,7,4'-triglucoside and 7-Osophoroside (Figure 1B). This compound was also characterized by NMR analysis and the obtained structural data
correspond to those found in the literature [13]. The presence of all three flavonoids increased with stigma development and the increase for the two kaempferol
triglucosides was equal. The relative levels of kaempferol
7-O-sophoroside, which reached the maximum levels at
anthesis, were much higher than those observed for both
kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucopyranoside and
kaempferol 3,7,4'-triglucoside, with relative high levels in
the scarlet stages (-2da to +3da) (Figure 1C).
Cloning and deduced structure of CsGT45
To identify flavonoid glucosyltransferases from C. sativus
stigmas, a homology-based strategy was used, taking
advantage of specific glycosyltranferase motifs located in
the C-terminus region [42]. A cDNA population was prepared by reverse transcription of poly (A)+ from total RNA
isolated from C. sativus stigmas at anthesis, which showed
the highest levels of kaempferol glucosides. DNA fragments were amplified by degenerate primers and the
obtained products were cloned and analysed. Sequencing
of one PCR product revealed homology to glycosyltransferases. The sequence information from this clone,
CsGT45, allowed the design of PCR specific primers to
obtain the full-length transcripts. We performed 5' and 3'
RACE using poly(A)+ from C. sativus stigma as a template.
The GTase gene obtained (1674 bp, Gen Bank FJ194947)
was intronless, containing a putative open reading frame

of 1500 bp encoding 500 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 55.42 kDa and a pI of 5.19.
Because C. sativus is a triploid, we employed in silico
screening of a large stigma cDNA EST database http://
www.saffrongenes.org/[43] as an effective method for
identification of potential CsGT45 alleles. We identified
three EST clones with 98% identity in 611 bp
(EX147039.1), 98% identity in 264 bp (EX144545.1) and
84% identity in 426 bp (EX148389.1). The first two ESTs
correspond to CsGT45, and the third could correspond to
a CsGT45 allele.
The carboxyl terminal of the protein contained the plant
secondary product glycosyltransferase (PSPG) box signature motif. Analysis of CsGT45 sequence for N-terminal
targeting signal or C- terminal membrane anchor signal
using SignalP and TMpred web-based programmes predicted CsGT45 to be non-secretory with an absence of predicted signal peptides or transmembrane signals [44].
For comparative modelling, CsGT45 was aligned with
MtUGT71G1, whose crystal structure has recently been
solved [45]. CsGT45 displayed 18% overall identity with
MtUGT71G1 (Figure 2A). A molecular model of CsGT45
was constructed from the structural alignment. Structurally conserved regions of the CsGT45 model were built
from the crystal structure of MtUGT71G1 using the Pyre
server [46] (Figure 2B). In plant GTs, the most common
sugar donor is UDP-Glc. Several conserved residues, most
of which are found in the PSPG motif of plant UGTs,
interact with the sugar donor [22]. The conserved residues
involved in the interaction with UDP-Glucose in
MtUGT71G1 are also conserved in CsGT45, with the
exception of the E381 residue that in CsGT45 is aspartate
residue D385, which is also found in the characterized
VvGT1 [22].
Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with
that of other glycosyltransferases reveals overall positional
identities of 44% with Pyrus communis flavonoid 7-O-glucosyltransferase (AAY27090.1), 41% with Arabidospis flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (At5g17050) and
flavonoid 7-O-glucosyltransferase NtF7GT (Nicotiana tabacum, BAB88935). The phylogenetic tree based on
deduced amino acid sequences if plant GTases is shown in
Figure 3. Currently, GTases function and specificity cannot be fully predicted based on sequence information
alone. However, the phylogenetic tree of functionally
characterized GTases showed several clusters, which could
be characterized by the specificity of the flavonoid glycosyltransferase activities of enzymes involved therein. Cluster

7-O-glycosyltransferases, and cluster IV contains broad

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/109

substrate GTases. Cs45GT is included in cluster II, which
contains anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferases (A5GT),
like VhA5GT, PfA5GT and PhA5GT which activities have
been tested in vitro [25,27] and other GTases with a broad
substrate specificity that are not involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, like UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 from
Arabidopsis, which produced distinct multiple glucosides
of quercetin in vitro [47], while in vivo act as anthranilate
glycosyltransferases [48] and GTases implicated in salicylic acid metabolism, like NtSalGT that reacts on several
phenolic compounds in vitro [49]. NtF7GT from Nicotiana
that reacts on the 7-hydroxyl group of flavonol and 3hydroxyl group of coumarin [29] and PcF7GT from Pyrus
communis that reacts on the 7-hydroxyl group of flavonol
[38]. Therefore, CsGT45 was presumed to encode a flavonoid GTase in C. sativus stigmas and was subjected to further analyses.
Biochemical characterization
To identify the function of CsGT45, the full-length open
reading frame was cloned into the expression vector
pGEX-5T-3 for heterologous protein expression in E. coli.
The recombinant protein was affinity purified on a glutathion sepharose column that binds the protein's N-terminal GST-tag (Figure 4A). Due to its homology with
other flavonoid glycosyltransferases, CsGT45 was
expected to glucosylate flavonoids. Activity tests were performed with UDP-Glucose and the flavonols quercetin
and kaempferol (Figure 4B). CsGT45 forms monoglucosides on the 7- hydroxyl group of kaempferol (Figure 4C
and 4E), whereas over quercetin forms monoglucosides
on the 7-, 3'-, and 4'-hydroxyl groups of quercetin (Figure
4D and 4F). Glucosylation positions of the kaempferol
and quercetin reaction products were assigned based on
the hypsochromic shift data [50], comparison with published data [31,47,51] and when available, using authentic reference compounds. Flavonols have two absorption
maxima: Band I (350–380) and Band II (240–280) corresponding to the B- and A-ring, respectively. Conjugation
of 3-, 5-, or 4'-hydroxyl groups causes a Band I hypsochromic shift, which is larger for a 3-substitution (12–17 nm)
than a 4'-conjugation (3–5 nm). The maximum absorbances of kaempferol were 266 and 368, and those of the
kaempferol reaction product were 268 and 368 nm. The
lack of a hypsochromic shift between substrate and reaction product strongly suggests that glycosylation occurred
at the hydroxyl group of C-7, which was confirmed by
comparison with an authentic reference standard (Figure
4C). For quercetin (256, 372) only the product P1 (256,
372) did not show a hypsochromic shift (Figure 4D) suggesting conjugation at the 7-hydroxyl group. P2 (254,
368) showed a Band I hypsochromic shift of 4 nm suggesting conjugation at the 4'-hydroxyl group, which was
confirmed by comparison with an authentic reference
standard (Figure 4D). The product P3 (252, 370) was ten-

tatively assigned to quercetin 3'-O-glucoside based on
comparison of related flavonoid product elution profiles
[31,47], and by the lack of coincidence with the quercetin
3-O-glucoside standard regarding spectral data and elution time (Fig 4D). When longer incubation times (60
min) and higher substrate concentration (100 mM) of
kaempferol or quercetin were used the formation of one
diglucoside was observed for each flavonoid (data not
shown). Other compounds, i.e. trans-cinnamic acid,
sinapic acid, crocin, IAA and abscisic acid were assayed,
but no activity was detected with any of these substrates.
The results obtained suggest that CsGT45 acts on flavonols in vivo. The kinetic parameters for the individual
glucosides formed were determined at variable concentrations of quercetin and kaempferol. The Kcat and Km values
are described in Table 1. The Vmax/Km ratios clearly demonstrate that CsGT45 exhibits the highest specificity
towards 7-OH of kaempferol (100%), followed by the 7-

OH and 4'-OH of quercetin (20.5 and 9.1%, respectively),
and low affinity toward the 3'-OH (3.1%).
The kinetic constants for UDP-glucose were also calculated. Different concentrations of UDP-glucose were
assayed keeping the level of kaempferol constant. UDPglucose showed a Km of 0.6 mM and a Vmax of 2.9 nkat/mg,
thus suggesting that glucose is a good substrate for
CsGT45.
Spatial and developmental expression
The spatial and temporal expression pattern of CsGT45
was studied by RT-PCR throughout stigma development.
Analyses were performed with RNA isolated from different stages of stigma development, i.e. flowers containing
yellow, orange and red stigmas, which are characterized
by the presence of immature anthers, and small tepals that
do not show the characteristic purple coloration of C. sati-

vus. These immature flowers are contained inside perianth
tubes that elongate as flowers develop inside. Only when
flowers are completely developed do they emerge from
the perianth tubes and open when anthesis (da) occurs a
few days later. Upon emerging, all flowers exhibited purple tepals and scarlet stigmas (-2da to +3da). The RT-PCR
analysis revealed that CsGT45 expression is developmentally regulated. The CsGT45 transcript level in the yellow
and orange stages was low, but increased from the red
stage, and reached a peak at anthesis (Figure 5A). The
expression of the CsGT45 was also examined in different
tissues. The expression in flower tissues showed that
CsGT45 transcripts were present in pollen, tepals and
styles at low levels whereas expression in corms was practically undetectable under these conditions (Figure 5A).
The high expression levels of CsGT45 transcripts in the
stigma tissue and its in vitro activity suggested that CsGT45
was associated with the observed kaempferol glucosylation in the stigma tissue. To investigate further such correlation the expression levels of CsGT45 were investigated in
the stigma tissue of Crocus species in which kaempferol
with substitutions in the 7-OH position were not detected
(Figure 5B–D). These three Crocus species showed reduced
flavonoid levels in comparison with C. sativus. In C. niveus
we were unable could to detect kaempferol glucosides, in
C. speciosus and C. cancellatus (Figure 5B and 5D) a kaempferol treahexoside was identified at position 10.35. This
compound, substituted at position 3, has been also identified in C. sativus as a minor flavonoid [15]. The expression of CsGT45 was not detected in the stigma tissue of C.
niveus, C. speciosus and C. cancellatus (Figure 5F), while was
present in the stigma tissue of C. sativus and C. cartwrightianus that accumulate kaempferol with substitutions in
the 7-OH position (Figure 1A and Figure 4E). By contrast,
the expression of UGTCs3, a GTase previously identified
in C. sativus stigmas [52] was detected in all the species
(Figure 5F). The absence of CsGT45 expression in the
stigma tissue of of C. niveus, C. speciosus and C. cancellatus
suggests a role of CsGT45 in the accumulation of specific
kaempferol glucosides in the stigma of Crocus species.
Unaltered Expression of CsGT45 under stress conditions
Several studies have shown that GTases are induced by a
variety of stresses, including: salicylic acid [49,53], auxin
[54], methyl jasmonate [55] and wounding [56]. To determine whether the gene expression levels of CsGT45 were
influenced by exogenous hormones or by other stimuli
such as drought stress and wounding, total RNA was isolated from treated leaves and used as template in the RTPCR reactions. The expression of the gene was not altered
24 hours after the treatments (Figure 6). Shorter times
were also tested with the same results (data not shown).
Exogenous JA, ABA, GA3, or 2,4D did not significantly
promote the expression of the genes (Figure 6). Drought,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/109

wounding and SA failed to affect the expression levels of
CsGT45 (Figure 6).

Discussion
In general, GTases that use secondary metabolites as substrates are minor constituents in plant cells [21]. Although
many of these enzymes have been isolated from several
plant species and assayed in vitro, in many cases their roles
in the secondary metabolism of these plants are still
unknown.
The saffron CsGT45 protein belongs to glucosyltransferase family 1, as do most of the UGTs involved in plant
secondary metabolism. This protein possessed a PSPG
box with a conserved sequence of 45 amino acid residues
and showed specificity towards flavonoid aglycones. This
protein has no signal sequence, nor any clear membranespanning or targeting signals, as the plant glycosyltransferases identified to date [57]. This suggests that these
enzymes function in the cytosol, although within that
compartment the proteins may associate as peripheral
components of the endomembrane system, as previously
suggested [58]. Sequence analysis showed CsGT45 as
being most closely related to the Pyrus communis flavonoid
7-O-glucosyltransferase and belonging to the same clade
of the phylogenetic tree, in which other glucosyltransferases of flavonoids attach sugars without high regiospecificity. The presence in this clade of A5GT enzymes
suggest a common ancestral gene for all these GTases,
where the A5GTs enzymes showed a strict substrate specificity [25,27,59], and seem to have evolved to a more specific function.
Plant secondary product glycosyltransferases have been
reported to exhibit a rather strict regioselectivity towards
the position of the sugar attachment [21]. The most common site on the flavonol molecule for glycosyl addition is
carbon 3 of the C-ring, although other sites, especially the
hydroxyl at carbon 7, are often substitutes [60]. However,
in proportion, there are few studies on the enzyme activity
and genes implicated in the catalysis of the 7-O-glucoside
reaction. Many plant GTases recognize quercetin as an
acceptor when assayed in vitro, and some others can glucosylate multiple hydroxyl groups of the aglycone and even
form diglucosides in some cases [28-31,36,41,56]. In Arabidopsis, from ninety one GTases analyzed for their activity
toward quercetin, 29 enzymes showed catalytic activity,
and four recognize three sites [31]. Analysing the activity
of some enzymes related to CsGT45, the Arabidopsis
enzyme UGT74F1, glycosylated the 3'-OH, 4'-OH and 7OH positions of quercetin [47]. We have observed similar
activity for CsGT45 toward quercetin, but with a preference for the 7-OH position (Km 21.5 μM). However,
CsGT45 showed high regioselectivity toward kaempferol,
and the same was reported for NtGT7 [29], present in the

CsGT45 cluster. This feature is characteristic for several 7O-glucosyltransferases present in cluster III and IV and
distantly related to CsGT45 [28,37,39,40,56]. The Km
value of kaempferol with CsGT45 is 15.6 μM, indicating
its sufficient affinity to the substrate. These Km values were
the same as other plant GTases reported [29,56], suggesting that these substrates are reasonable acceptors for
CsGT45. Moreover, the CsGT45 enzyme did not react on
other OHs of kaempferol, indicating that in this case the
regiospecificity of the glucosylation is strictly determined.
It has recently been reported that the hydroxylation pattern in ring B of the acceptor molecule can influence product specificity. UGT73A4 from Beta vulgaris accepts the
positions 4' and 7 of flavonols. If a hydroxy group is
present at position 3' (e.g. quercetin), 4'-O-glucosides are
preferentially formed. If the hydroxy group is missing (e.g.
kaempferol), the enzyme produced 7-O-glucosides [36].
Perhaps the differences observed for CsGT45 towards
quercetin or kaempferol are due to this fact.
Because quercetin and kaempferol are substrates for
CsGT45 in vitro, it is reasonable to propose that this
enzyme is involved in the glucosylation of phenolics in
the stigma tissue. Analysis of the flavonoid fraction from
saffron revealed the unique presence of kaempferol [15].
The gene expression pattern of CsGT45 correlates with
high levels of kaempferol glucosides in the stigma tissue.
Interestingly the three main flavonoid glycosides detected
in the stigma at anthesis were kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucopyranoside, kaempferol 3,7,4'-triglucoside
and kaempferol 7-O-sophoroside. CsGT45 was found to
be active on the C-7 position of kaempferol, with the production of a monoglucoside and probably a diglucoside
under the experimental conditions tested. Since kaempferol-7-O-sophoroside was the main flavonoid in the
stigma tissue, we can speculate whether CsGT45 uses
UDP-sophoroside as a sugar donor. However, UDP-Glc
does appear to be a good donor and the sugar donor preference of a specific GT is often very narrow, showing little

or no activity with alternative sugars [22]. By using a
molecular modelling approach, we observed that CsGT45
and MtUGT71G1 share higher structural similarity, indicative of similar binding modes with sugar donors. In addition, the residues that interact with the UDP-Glc molecule
were conserved in CsGT45. To our knowledge, no GTase
has been shown to use UDP-sophoroside as a sugar
donor. Furthermore, the bright blue or red flowers in the
Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil) contain anthocyanidin 3-O-sophoroside derivatives, and the UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin
3-O-glucoside-2"-Oglucosyltransferase (3GGT) enzyme mediates the glucosylation of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides to yield
anthocyanidin 3-O-sophorosides, whereas another glucosyltransferase catalyzes the addition of a glucose molecule
to the 3 position [61]. Thus, most probably CsGT45 is
responsible for the production of Kaempferol 7-O-glucoside and another GGT could be responsible for the generation of kaempferol 7-O-sophoroside.
The absence of CsGT45 activity toward the C-3 or the C-4'
positions of kaempferol indicates that other glucosyltransferases are implicated in the flavonoid glucosylation
in C. sativus stigma. In fact, enzymes that catalyzed the
transfer of glycosyl groups to the flavonol C-3 position are
included in a different cluster than CsGT45.
The increase of flavonoids in the stigma tissue could be
associated with the role of flavonoids in protection
against abiotic and biotic stresses [62]. The ultra-violet
(UV)-absorbing characteristics of flavonoids have long
been considered to be evidence for the role of flavonoids
in UV protection. The mechanism of protection by flavonoids could be suppression of free radicals formed upon
exposure to UV light [63]. Flavonoids are often present in
the epidermal cell layers of leaves and in tissues that are
susceptible to UV light, such as pollen and the apical meristem [64]. In C. sativus the flavonoid levels are specially
high in scarlet stigmas (-2da to +3da) that are characterized for being exposed to sunlight, whereas the stigmas for
earlier developmental stages are under the soil and
enclosed inside the perianth tubes, and therefore protected from the light.
Another well-documented property of flavonoids is their
antimicrobial effect [65,66]. High levels of kaempferol are
even reported to inhibit the growth of viruses [67]. The
mechanism of kaempferol toxicity is not known, but
kaempferol can promote radical formation that might
interfere with vital functions of pathogens [68]. The
stigma appears to offer a hostile environment to bacteria
and fungi since growth of these organisms on the stigma
is rare [69]. The presence of flavonoids in the stigma tissue
could be associated with the protection of stigmas from
pathogen attack.

In addition to these possible functions of flavonoids in
the stigma of C. sativus, flavonoids are also involved in the
control of polar auxin transport [5,70,71], which determines plant organ morphology, such as leaf and flower
shape [72]. In flowers, stigma and style growth is due to
cell elongation, but not to cell division. The transition
from the red stage of stigma development in C. sativus to
the fully developed stigma (-2da to +3da) is accompanied
by a rapid increase in size. When the stigmas of C. sativus
are fully developed they are slender at the base and wider
at the apex where they fold to give a trumpet-like structure
[73]. The typical morphology of C. sativus stigmas could
be the result of different auxin distribution controlled by
flavonoid signals.
Expression analysis showed low levels of CsGT45 in
tepals. The tepals of C. sativus are characterized by high
levels of anthocyanins, up to 90% of total flavonoids [17].
Nevertheless, a total of nine quercetin and kaempferol
glycosides have been identified in minor amounts in C.
sativus tepals, and a flavonoid-7-O-glucosyltransferase was
predicted to be responsible for the formation of two of
them [17].

Conclusion
In this study, we have determined the role of CsGT45 in
the transfer of glucose on 7-OH of flavonoids, together
with its implication in the generation of C. sativus flavonoids in the stigma tissue. C. sativus stigmas are mainly
used for culinary purposes, and historically have been
employed in many medicinal drugs against numerous
health conditions [74,75]. Flavonoids have long been
known to be important nutraceutical components in our
diet, due to their potent anti-oxidant properties [76], with
glycosylation as a major mechanism influencing their
activity. Therefore, the characterization of glucosyltransferases implicated in the formation of these compounds
in C. sativus will help to understand the biosynthesis and
regulation of these glucosides and their implications in
the nutraceutical properties of saffron.

Methods
Chemicals and Plant materials
Chemicals and reagents were obtained from SigmaAldrich unless otherwise stated. Plant tissues and stigmas
from C. sativus grown under field conditions in Tarazona
de La Mancha, Spain, were used throughout the experiments. C. cancellatus, C. speciosus, C. niveus and C. cartwrightianus were obtained from Dr. U. Jacobsen from the
Agricultural University of Denmark. Stigmas were collected at the developmental stages previously described
[77], and defined as follows: yellow stigma, closed bud
inside the perianth tubes (around 0.3 cm in length);
orange stigma, closed bud inside the perianth tubes
(around 0.4 cm in length); red stigma, closed bud inside

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/109

the perianth tubes (0.8 cm in length); -2da, two days
before anthesis, dark red stigma in closed bud outside the
perianth tubes (3 cm in length); da, day of anthesis, dark
red stigma (3 cm in length); +1da, one day after anthesis,
dark red stigma and +3da, three days after anthesis, dark
red stigma. Tepals, style and stamens were collected from
flowers at the time of anthesis and together with corms
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until
required. To determine stress-induced gene expression in
leaves, whole leaves were collected from plants growing in
fields, cut into 1 cm-long pieces and transferred to 24well-plates containing 1 ml water supplemented with
abscisic acid (ABA) (100 μM), 2,4-dichlorofenoxiacetic
acid (2,4D) (100 μM), Giberellic acid (GA3) (100 μM),
0.2 μl/ml Methyl Jasmonate (MetJa), 200 mM CaCl2, 1
mM potassium salicylate (SA), pH 6.5, and distilled water
that was used as a control. All the samples were incubated
under normal conditions (16 h light/8 h dark cycles at
22°C). Wounding was performed on leaves with a sterile
needle and samples were then frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and were stored at -80°C until used.
Cloning of C. sativus GTase cDNA
As a first step in identifying GTases genes expressed in saffron stigmas, total RNA and mRNA were isolated from
developed saffron stigmas by using Ambion PolyAtrack
and following manufacturer's protocols (Ambion Inc.,
Austin, TX, USA). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized by
reverse transcription (RT) from 2 μg of total RNA using an
18-base pair oligo dT primer and a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. These cDNAs were used as templates
for PCR using degenerate primers designed based on the
conserved regions of the plants GTases [78]. The primers
used were: glut-f (5'-TSNGTNGCNTAYGTNTSNTTYGG3') and glut-r (5'-TTCCANCCRCARTGNGTNACRAA-3').
Anchored PCR with gene-specific primers were used to
analyse and identify the 5' and 3' ends of the glucosyltransferases. For these, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from stigmas
was used to synthesize the 5' and 3' ends of the first-strand
cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase, using the
primers 5'-CDS primer and SMARTII-A oligo for the 5'RACE reaction and the 3'-CDS primer A for the 3'-RACE
reaction supplied in the SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech-Takara). Following dilution, the firststrand reaction product was subjected to PCR for amplification. We used the gene-specific primers CsGT45-f1 (5'AGCTGTCGATAAGATGGATATC-3'), and CsGT45-f2 (5'GAGTGTCTTATCGCATCCT-3') as forward primers, and
CsGT45-r1
(5'-GAAGCCAAGCTCTCCATCGTCGA-3')
and CsGT45-r2 (5'-CTCCAGCTGGCCGAATGTGTTC-3')
as reverse primers in combination with the universal
primer mix from the SMART RACE kit as the reverse/forward primer with the following cycling program: one
cycle at 94°C for 3 min, 10 cycles at 94°C for 20 s, 66°C–

0.2°C/cycle for 20 s, and 72°C for 2 min, 30 cycles at
94°C for 20 s, 64°C for 20 s and 72°C for 2 min, and a
final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The amplified PCR
products were analysed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose
gel. The PCR products were then cloned into pGEM-T
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The ligated
DNA was transformed into E. coli strain JM109. The clones
(20 colonies) were picked individually and amplified in 3
ml of LB medium at 37°C overnight. The plasmid DNA
from each clone was extracted using a DNA plasmid Miniprep kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) and
then analysed by EcoRI restriction digestion. One clone of
each size was sent to t Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea)
for sequencing using the BigDyeTM terminator kit and
run on ABI 3730XL (Perkin Elmer) with either the T7 or
Sp6 sequencing primers. Computer-aided sequence similarity searches were made with the BLAST suite of programs at the National Centre for Biotechnology

http://psort.nibb.ac.jp. Once the 5' and 3' sequences were
determined, the full-length clone CsGT45 was amplified
from the cDNA and genomic DNA with the following
primer sequences: the forward primer, 5'-CAGATGGACCAACATCAGCCT-3'; and the reverse primer 5'-ATTATCTCAACACCTGTGTGG-3'.
Heterologous expression
The full-length open reading frame of CsGT45 cDNA was
amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The oligonucleotide
sequences for CsGT45 cloning were as follows: the forward primer 5'-ACCAACATCAGCCTAACATT-3', and the
reverse primer 5'-TGCGGCCGCTCCTCCTTTAAGAGGGTGA-3'. Using these primers, the generated product
has a NotI site at the 3' end (underlined in the reverse
primer). The PCR product was cloned directionally (SmaINotI) into bacterial GST expression vector pGEX-5T-3
(Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare) to create inframe fusions at the 5' terminus with the GST coding
sequence. The construct was sequenced to confirm that
the gene was in the correct reading frame. After transformation into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, colonies were
selected on LB containing ampicillin (AMP) plates. Individual colonies were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB-AMP
medium at 20°C, and 2.5 ml of the culture was used to
inoculate 500 ml of LB-AMP fresh medium. Cells were
grown at 20°C until an A600 of 0.6 was reached, after
which the culture was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and
allowed to grow for 16 h at 20°C. The cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 10 min and resuspended
in 20 ml PBS. Resuspended cells were sonicated with a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/109

microtip probe in ice until the viscosity disappeared. After
sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for
25 min. The supernatant and pellet were tested by PAGE
(polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)/SDS for solubility of
the fusion protein by coomasie stain. The soluble proteins
were applied to a glutathione Sepharose column for purification following manufacturer instructions (Amersham
Biosciences/GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was
determined according to the Bradford method [79], using
serum albumin as standard.
Enzyme assays and analysis of reaction products
The affinity-purified enzyme was used to determine substrate specificity and enzymatic parameters. In a final
assay volume of 200 μl, the reaction conditions were 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5
mM UDP-glucose, the recombinant enzyme (7.0 μg) and
the corresponding substrates: 100 μM Quercetin, 100 μM
kaempferol, 100 μM cyanidin, 1 mM trans-cinnamic acid,
1 mM sinapic acid, 1 mM indole acetic acid, 1 mM abscisic
acid and 1 μM crocetin encapsulated in maltosyl-β-cyclodextrin as described [80]. All the glucosyltranferase activity assays were carried out at 30°C for 30 minutes. For the
determination of the Km values of substrates, the concentrations of kaempferol and quercetin were varied from 20
to 100 μM, at a fixed UDP-glucose concentration of 2.5
mM and 7.0 μg of the purified enzyme. These enzymatic
reactions were performed at 30°C for 10, 15 and 20 minutes for each substrate concentration. The reactions were
terminated, and the proteins precipitated, by the addition
of 20 μl of trichloroacetic acid (240 mg/ml). Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 5 min to
collect the supernatant, and aliquots were analysed by
reverse-phase HPLC as previously described [81] using a
C18 Ascentis, 25 × 4.6, particle size 5 um column
(Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich). Km values were determined
from Lineweaver-Burk plots of initial rate data. The assays
were also analysed by HPLC DAD detector and by electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS) for the formation of glycosylated products as previously described
[81] using a C18 Ascentis, 25 × 4.6, particle size 3 um column (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich). A standard curve for peak
area of quercetin and kaempferol was produced by injecting known amounts of these flavonoids. For individual
quercetin glucosides, standard curves were constructed
indirectly by calculating the amount of quercetin or
kaempferol released after quantitative hydrolysis of the
glucoside with β-glucosidase from almonds (60 min, pH
6, 30°C). The assignment of a glucosylation position to
quercetin and kaempferol was determined indirectly following the method by Mabry et al. [50] for the identification of flavonoids, using published data [31,47,51] and
by comparison with authentic flavonol standards: kaempferol 7-O-glucoside and quercetin 4'-O-glucoside (Trans-

MIT Flavonoidforschung, DE) and quercetin 3-Oglucoside (Sigma-Aldrich).
Flavonoid analysis in stigma tissue
Stigmas at the time of anthesis were ground in liquid
nitrogen. The fine powder obtained was extracted with
methanol (500 μl), centrifuged and the supernatant analysed by LC-ESI-MS using a C18 Ascentis column 15 × 2.1,
particle size 3 um (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich) and following
the method previously described [81]. For flavonoid analysis from stigmas at different developmental stages (yellow to +3da), three stigmas of each stage were collected
and freeze-dried. The powder obtained from one stigma
was extracted with 500 μl of methanol containing 0.2 mg/
ml 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucuronide as an internal
standard. The samples were centrifuged (5,000 g, 10 min),
and the supernatant evaporated and treated as described
[15]. Samples in triplicate were analysed by HPLC as
described [81] using a C18 Ascentis, 25 × 4.6, particle size
5 um column (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich).

The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were
recorded on Brucker DRX 500 NMR instrument operating
at 500 MHz for 1H and at 125 MHz for 13C, respectively.
Chemical shifts were recorded as described [15].
Analysis of mRNA levels in different tissues and stress
conditions
Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to determine the relative levels of CsGT45 and UGTCs3 messages.
Total RNA was isolated from control and treated leaves,
tepals, stamens, stigmas, styles and corms using the Trizol
reagent (Gibco-BRL). The RNA was resuspended in 100 μl
of RNase-free water and treated with RQ1 RNase-free
DNase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The
DNase was heat inactivated before RT-PCR. The RNA was
quantified with a spectrophotometer and stored at -80°C.
Various initial concentrations of mRNA, ranging over 10
fold difference, were used to demonstrate the differential
accumulation of the mRNA in the tissues analysed. Firststrand cDNAs were synthesized by RT from 2 μg of total
RNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia)
and random primers. Conditions for semi-quantitative
RT-PCR were as follows: 65°C for 5 min, followed by
37°C for 1 h, followed by 75°C for 5 min. The cDNAs
obtained were used as templates for PCR using the
CsGT45 gene-specific primers: 5'-GATGGGGAGAGAGGTGTTGA-3' and 5'-TCCTCGCAATGCTGTCTATG-3', and
for the amplification of gene coding for the 18S ribosomal
RNA (RPS18) the primers used were: 5'-AGTTTGAGGCAATAACAGGTCT-3' and 5'-GATGAAATTTCCCAAGATTACC-3'. UGTCs3 was amplified using the primers
previously described [52]. Thermal cycling parameters
were 2 min at 95°C, 30 × (20 s at 95°C, 20 s at 60°C, and
30 s at 72°C). The PCR products were separated in a 2%

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/109

agarose gel. The gels were photographed with the IP-010Sd photo-documentation system (Vilber Lourmat). The
PhotoCaptMw programme was used to quantify the
intensity of the ethidium bromide stained DNA bands
from the positive images of the gel. These experiments
were repeated three times and averaged for each sample.
To correct the initial mRNA levels, each intensity score
was normalized to the intensity for the RPS18 gene amplification.
