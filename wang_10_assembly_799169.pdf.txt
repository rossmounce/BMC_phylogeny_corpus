Abstract
Background: Through the Community Sequencing Program, a catfish EST sequencing project was carried out
through a collaboration between the catfish research community and the Department of Energy’s Joint Genome
Institute. Prior to this project, only a limited EST resource from catfish was available for the purpose of SNP
identification.
Results: A total of 438,321 quality ESTs were generated from 8 channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and 4 blue
catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) libraries, bringing the number of catfish ESTs to nearly 500,000. Assembly of all catfish
ESTs resulted in 45,306 contigs and 66,272 singletons. Over 35% of the unique sequences had significant similarities
to known genes, allowing the identification of 14,776 unique genes in catfish. Over 300,000 putative SNPs have
been identified, of which approximately 48,000 are high-quality SNPs identified from contigs with at least four
sequences and the minor allele presence of at least two sequences in the contig. The EST resource should be
valuable for identification of microsatellites, genome annotation, large-scale expression analysis, and comparative
genome analysis.
Conclusions: This project generated a large EST resource for catfish that captured the majority of the catfish
transcriptome. The parallel analysis of ESTs from two closely related Ictalurid catfishes should also provide powerful
means for the evaluation of ancient and recent gene duplications, and for the development of high-density
microarrays in catfish. The inter- and intra-specific SNPs identified from all catfish EST dataset assembly will greatly
benefit the catfish introgression breeding program and whole genome association studies.

Background
Catfish is the major aquaculture species in the United
States, accounting for over 60% of all US aquaculture
production. While channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)
accounts for the majority of commercial aquaculture
production, the closely related blue catfish (Ictalurus
furcatus) possesses several economically important traits
that led to the production of an inter-specific hybrid
(channel catfish female × blue catfish male) available for
commercial use [1]. This specific hybrid shows strong
heterosis and superior performance traits in disease
resistance, growth rate, feed conversion efficiency, processing yields, and seinability. Channel catfish is also an
important model species for the study of comparative
immunology, reproductive physiology, and toxicology.
The channel catfish immune system is among the best
characterized of any fish species, with decades of
research leading to identification and characterization of
catfish immune genes [2,3], establishment of clonal
functionally distinct lymphocyte cell lines [4], characterization of much of the machinery of catfish innate [5,6]
and adaptive immunity and production of panels of specific monoclonal antibodies for detection of catfish
immunocytes [7-9].
Genome research requires the development of a number of resources that facilitate both structural and functional analysis of the genome. Many of the required
resources have been developed in catfish, including a
large number of polymorphic markers [10,11], linkage
maps [12-14], bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
libraries [15,16], physical maps [17,18], and BAC end
sequences (BES) [19,20]. However, expressed sequence
tag (EST) resources were low from catfish [21-26], hindering both functional and comparative genome analysis
in catfish. Large numbers of ESTs have been produced
for most model species as well as a number of agriculturally important species [27-32], including cattle (1.5 million), swine (1.4 million), chicken (600,000), Atlantic
salmon (471,000), and rainbow trout (281,000). The
availability of such EST resources has allowed efficient
gene discovery and gene identification in these species,
and rapid progress has been made through comparative
genome analysis in understanding structural, organizational, and functional properties of the genomes of these
species.
A whole genome sequence is not available for most
aquaculture species. In the absence of the whole genome
sequence of catfish, we initiated this large-scale EST
project to provide transcriptomic resources in channel
catfish and blue catfish. These ESTs will serve as
resources for gene discovery and gene identification,
supply the framework for high-density microarray platforms, provide a foundation for the analysis of full-

Page 2 of 14

length cDNAs, and assist in the identification of genetic
markers such as microsatellites and single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). In this study, we have taken a
unique inter-specific approach. The inter-specific
approach will help develop markers that are inter-specific and species specific. These resources will also be of
great use for comparative genome analysis. The interspecific EST approach to produce parallel EST resources
from two closely related Ictalurid species will allow the
resolution of some of the most difficult issues in teleost
genome research, such as paralog confusions involving
duplicated genomes [33-35]. Here we report the generation and analysis of nearly 500,000 ESTs from catfish,
including 354,377 ESTs from channel catfish and
139,475 ESTs from blue catfish.

Results
cDNA libraries and EST sequencing

Twelve cDNA libraries were constructed from various tissues, organs, and cell lines, including four blue catfish
libraries and eight channel catfish libraries (Table 1). More
than 600,000 sequencing reactions were attempted to
sequence a total of 307,296 cDNA clones from both ends.
A total of 438,321 ESTs were generated from this project,
of which 128,711 sequences were from blue catfish and
309,610 were from channel catfish (Table 1). Of these EST
sequences, 219,831 were sequenced from the 5’ end of the
transcripts, and 218,490 were sequenced from the 3’ end.
A total of 194,136 clones had paired reads from both 5’
and 3’ ends of the same transcripts. The lengths of the
ESTs range from 100 to 877 bp, with an average length of
576 bp and a median length of 655 bp (Figure 1). Addition
of these sequences to the 10,764 blue catfish ESTs and
44,767 channel catfish ESTs in GenBank before the start
of this project increased the number of catfish ESTs to
almost a half million sequences (139,475 blue catfish ESTs
and 354,377 channel catfish ESTs; Table 1). The ESTs
from blue catfish and channel catfish have been deposited
in GenBank under accession numbers [GenBank:
FC996013-FC999999,
FD000001-FD380635
and
GH640296-GH693994].
EST assembly

All existing catfish EST sequences were used to produce
three assemblies: blue catfish ESTs; channel catfish
ESTs; and blue catfish and channel catfish ESTs for
inter-specific analysis. Assembly of 139,475 blue catfish
ESTs resulted in 54,815 unique sequences (22,009 contigs and 32,806 singletons) whereas assembly of 354,377
channel catfish ESTs resulted in 70,717 unique EST
sequences (28,941 contigs and 41,776 singletons) (Table
2). Details of the catfish EST assembly are available
online [36].

In order to identify inter-specific SNPs, we also conducted the assembly of all available 493,852 ESTs from
blue catfish and channel catfish. This assembly allowed
the formation of 45,306 contigs (66,272 singletons),
from which potential inter-specific SNPs could be identified. The number of inter-specific contigs was significantly larger than that from either species, potentially
due to the formation of new contigs of related transcripts that were singletons in either species (see Discussion). A majority of contigs contained only two
(43%) or three (13%) sequences (Figure 2), and average
contig depth was nine sequences. With the ESTs being
sequenced mostly from normalized libraries, the vast
majority of contigs had 50 or fewer sequences. However, some extremely large contigs were found. The

largest contig, containing 7,208 sequences, putatively
identified as apolipoprotein, was repeatedly sequenced
from all libraries, and was prevalent in the pre-existing
non-normalized libraries in GenBank. As previously
reported [37], contig depth is one of the two most
important factors affecting EST-derived SNP qualities.
Therefore, the information on contig depth is highly
useful.
To assess the similarity between blue catfish and
channel catfish sequences, the consensus sequences
from each species were compared to each other using
BLASTN at a stringency of 1E-10. Of blue catfish and
channel catfish sequences with a minimal 200-bp
matching region, sequence similarity ranged from 77%
to 100%, with an average similarity of 95%. Over 50% of

Gene identification and annotation

Putative gene identification was conducted either by ab
initio identification of open reading frames (ORFs) or by
BLASTX similarity search of public protein databases.
Of the 111,578 total unique catfish sequences (total catfish EST assembly), ORFs were detected from 83,198
(75%) unique sequences, with an average ORF length of
450 bp (minimum = 51 bp, maximum = 14,674 bp; Figure 4), and the remaining 28,380 sequences (25%) contained no ORFs (Figure 5a). These ORF-less ESTs were
likely ESTs sequenced within the untranslated regions
(UTRs) or within intron-retaining cDNAs.
There was a positive correlation between the length of
ORF and BLASTX match. Of the identified ORFs, 91%
had a length of more than 100 bp. Within these ORFs,
53% had significant (1E-10) BLASTX matches (Figures
5b, c). However, only 6% of the ORFs with less than 100
bp had significant BLASTX matches (Figure 5d).
A total of 41,311 (37%) unique sequences had significant BLASTX matches within the nr database, and

Figure 2 Distribution of contig sizes.

34,860 (31%) had significant BLASTX matches within
the Uniprot database (Table 3). Over 98% of unique
sequences with significant matches were identified with
ORFs, which indicated the reliability of ORF searching.
After examination of putative protein identities from the
BLASTX searches, homologous sequences were identified from the catfish ESTs. Of the 41,311 sequences
with BLASTX hits, 22,642 (approximately 55%) and
17,948 (approximately 43%) unique proteins were identified through searches against the nr and the Uniprot
protein databases after removing the redundant protein
hits, respectively.
Assessment of the sequenced catfish transcriptome

In order to assess the level to which the catfish transcriptome has been captured, the unique catfish
sequences (111,578) were also searched against the
NCBI Refseq and Ensembl databases. A number of significant hits were identified within zebrafish, medaka,
Tetraodon, human, mouse, and chicken reference protein databases (Table 3). After removal of the redundant
protein hits, 14,988 - 11,059 unique reference proteins
were identified within zebrafish, medaka, Tetraodon,
human, mouse, and chicken databases respectively
(Table 3). The unique catfish sequences had hits to 54%
to 57% of the unique proteins of zebrafish, medaka, and
green-spotted pufferfish. To allow comparison of catfish
unique protein coverage with that expected between
species with complete genome sequences, all Tetraodon
Ensembl proteins were searched against the medaka
Ensembl protein database. A total of 22,150 Tetraodon
proteins have significant hits to 15,054 (61% of total
unique) medaka Ensembl proteins with a cutoff E-value
of 1E-10. Similarly, zebrafish Refseq proteins were
searched against the human Refseq protein database. In
this case, 24,971 zebrafish proteins have significant hits

to 13,789 (36% of total unique) human proteins with a
cutoff E-value of 1E-10. Taken together, these numbers
provide strong evidence that this project has captured a
large majority of the catfish transcriptome.
A total of 14,776 cumulative unique genes were identified from catfish based on BLASTX searches against
the Refseq/Ensembl database (Table 3), including 8,075
genes identified from both blue catfish and channel

catfish, 1,881 unique genes from blue catfish and 4,820
unique genes from channel catfish (Figure 6). As
expected based on sequencing coverage depths, significantly more unique genes were identified from channel
catfish than blue catfish.

(58% of total number of unique catfish genes) putative
known unique genes were found in all six species:
11,303 (76%) were found in all three fish species; and
14,515 (98%) were found in at least one of the three fish
species (Figure 7), indicating a high level of conservation
of gene content among catfish and other teleost fish
species.
Prediction of full-length cDNAs

The catfish EST sequences provide a platform for the
identification and characterization of full-length cDNA
clones without having to use expensive and labor-intensive primer walking sequencing. In the context of this
work, full-length cDNA inserts were defined as a cDNA
from a single clone with the start codon and poly (A) tail
contained within the clone. A total of 10,037 channel catfish and 7,382 blue catfish putative full-length cDNAs
were identified from the assembly with a cutoff E-value
of 1E-5. A well characterized full-length cDNA set from
catfish will be crucial in ongoing studies of teleost gene
duplication and gene family structure, as well as aiding in
annotation of the catfish whole genome sequence. Current efforts are focused, therefore, on characterization
and re-sequencing of these full-length cDNAs.
Microsatellite and SNP marker identification

A total of 20,757 microsatellites were initially identified
from 15,082 unique sequences, including di-, tri-, tetra-,

Page 7 of 14

penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeats (Table 4). After
removing the microsatellites without enough flanking
sequence for primer design, 13,375 unique sequences
with microsatellites had sufficient flanking sequences
(50 bp) on both sides of the microsatellites to design
primers for genotyping. Our previous research indicated
that over 72% of EST-derived microsatellites were polymorphic in one resource family [12], suggesting the
potential utility of these microsatellites.
A total of 48,702 putative SNPs and 14,803 putative
insertions/deletions (indels) were identified from the
blue catfish EST dataset assembly; 102,252 putative
SNPs and 41,660 putative indels were identified from
channel catfish EST dataset assembly (Table 5). These
putative SNPs indicated an SNP rate of 3.2 SNPs per
kilobase of transcribed sequences in blue catfish, and 4.1
SNPs per kilobase of transcribed sequences in channel
catfish. Obviously, such SNP rates were calculated from
the total consensus sequence length and, therefore, the
deeper the EST sequencing was, the greater the possibility for the identification of a SNP within the consensus
sequences.
Over 303,000 putative SNPs and 100,000 putative
indels were identified from the all catfish EST assembly
results (Table 5). EST-derived SNPs are often prone to
sequencing errors. Therefore, the putative SNPs were
subjected to filtering using only those with contig sizes
of at least four sequences and the minor allele presence
of at least two sequences in the contigs, and indels were

not used for further analysis [37]. These parameters
were previously shown to select markers with 70% success rate for genotyping. After filtering, 3,891 and
15,827 SNPs were identified from the blue catfish and
channel catfish EST dataset assemblies, respectively. A
subset of 48,594 filtered SNPs were obtained from the
all catfish EST assembly; these SNPs included 32,235
transitions and 16,359 transversions (Table 5). The filtered SNP frequency in the transcribed sequences was
0.25 SNP in blue catfish, 0.64 SNP in channel catfish,
and 1.6 SNP in the all catfish assembly per kilobase. A
total of 19,398 filtered insertions and deletions (Indels)
were discovered, that is, 0.64 indels per kilobase of the

transcribed sequences. Of the 48,594 SNPs, over 90%
were identified from the contigs containing 5 or more
sequences (Table 6).
The assessment of the rates of inter-specific SNPs and
intra-specific SNPs may have practical applications. We
therefore assessed these SNP rates using the EST data.
First, SNPs were identified from contigs containing at
least four sequences with at least two sequences from
either channel catfish or blue catfish in the all catfish
EST assembly. Inter-specific SNPs were defined as those
that have sequence variations between blue catfish and
channel catfish, but no sequence variations within blue
catfish or within channel catfish; similarly, SNPs were
identified within blue catfish but not within channel catfish or vice versa; and SNPs were identified within both
channel catfish and blue catfish at the same SNP positions (Figure 8). Of the 48,594 filtered SNPs, 42,080
were identified from contigs comprising both channel
catfish and blue catfish ESTs, and 6,514 were identified
from contigs composed of ESTs from either channel
catfish or blue catfish, including 5,396 from channel catfish contigs and 1,118 were identified from blue catfish
contigs. Of the contigs containing ESTs from both blue
catfish and channel catfish, the estimation of percentage
of inter- and intra-specific SNPs was conducted based
on the identification of SNPs from 1,000 randomly

minor allele sequences, but only one of the minor allele
sequences was from one of the two species of blue catfish or channel catfish (Table 7). Additionally, the number of inter-specific SNPs may be overestimated, due to
failure to capture minor allele sequences from one or
both species in the current EST data. However, the
sequence differences between species should be greater
than those within species. Although a large number of
filtered inter-specific SNPs were identified (18,000 out
of 48,000 total filtered SNPs), they were identified from
a relatively small number of contigs. The 18,000 filtered
inter-specific SNPs were identified from approximately
2,800 contigs, with an average of 6.6 SNPs per contig.

Discussion
This project represents one of the major milestones in
catfish research, and brings the catfish EST resources to
almost a half million sequences in GenBank [21-26].
This EST resource will prove useful for gene discovery,
molecular marker development, and genetic linkage and
comparative mapping, and it will help facilitate whole
genome sequencing and annotation. Parallel EST
sequencing in two closely related species, I. punctatus
and I. furcatus, may also provide the material basis for
the analysis of genome duplication and genome evolution, providing the basis for establishment of orthologies
through phylogenetics analysis.
The most important outcome of EST sequencing is
gene discovery. This project allowed identification of
70,717 unique sequences in channel catfish and 54,815
unique sequences in blue catfish. We also conducted

*SNPs were identified from contigs containing at least four sequences with at least two sequences from either channel catfish or blue catfish in the all catfish
EST assembly: 1where there were no intra-specific blue catfish SNPs or intra-specific channel catfish SNPs, but the sequence differed between the two species at
the inter-specific SNP position; 2where there were SNPs within blue catfish, but not within channel catfish; 3where there were SNPs within channel catfish, but
not within blue catfish; 4where there were SNPs within both blue catfish and channel catfish; 5undetermined because overall the SNPs qualified as SNPs with at
least two minor allele sequences, but only one of the minor allele sequences was from one of the two species of blue catfish or channel catfish; 6these SNPs
were identified from ESTs that have been sequenced from only one of the two species, blue catfish or channel catfish, to date.

Wang et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R8

EST assembly using ESTs from both channel catfish and
blue catfish. Assembly of all the catfish ESTs resulted in
111,578 unique sequences. Comparison of channel catfish and blue catfish coding regions in this study indicated that the two species share, on average, 95%
sequence identity. Therefore, combining genes identified
from both species should provide a more complete picture as to what fraction of the catfish transcriptome was
captured to date. Such an approach was taken also
because of practical considerations. Hybrid catfish produced by inter-specific hybridization of channel catfish
× blue catfish is one of the best production lines of catfish used in aquaculture, and many believe that industry-wide application of this hybrid may have a
revolutionary impact on the catfish industry. One of the
major catfish breeding programs is based on introgression of beneficial genes from blue catfish into channel
catfish breeds. Genetic linkage mapping has been conducted in both the intra-specific resource families involving only channel catfish [14] and the inter-specific
resource families made from backcrosses of the channel
catfish × blue catfish hybrids [12,13].
Given the close phylogenetic relationship of blue catfish and channel catfish, we expected that many of the
contigs from the blue catfish and channel catfish EST
assembly would merge together in an all catfish EST
assembly. However, the all catfish EST assembly generated 45,306 contigs, a much greater number than the
contigs generated in either the blue catfish (22,009) or
channel catfish (28,941) EST assembly. There could be
several reasons for this major increase in contig numbers with the all catfish EST assembly. First, some ESTs
belonging to the contigs were only sequenced in blue
catfish but not in channel catfish, and vice versa; second,
singletons in either blue catfish or channel catfish were
brought together to form new contigs; third, sequence
variations or splicing differences between the two species may have led to the formation of a larger number
of contigs under our assembly parameters; fourth, ESTs
derived primarily from transcript untranslated regions of
the two species may differ sufficiently to prevent placement in the same contig. Thorough analysis of the dataset has revealed that all four of these factors contributed
to the high number of contigs in the all catfish
assembly.
Analysis of the all catfish unique sequences showed
that a large proportion of the catfish transcriptome has
been captured. BLASTX searches identified 37% of total
transcripts with significant hits, similar to levels
reported in the salmon EST project [30]. The 111,578
unique catfish sequences had hits to 54% to 57% of the
unique proteins of zebrafish, medaka, and green-spotted
pufferfish using a cutoff value of E-10. This percentage
appeared at first glance to be lower than our

Page 11 of 14

expectations. We therefore carried out best-hit searches
using identical parameters as those used with catfish but
comparing protein coverage of species with complete
genome (transcriptome) sequences to serve as reference
points. We found that the Tetraodon protein set had
significant hits to only 61% of medaka proteins. By comparison, our catfish data set had significant hits to 56%
and 57% of medaka and Tetraodon proteins, respectively. Similarly, zebrafish Refseq proteins were searched
against the human Refseq protein database. In this case,
zebrafish proteins had significant hits to 36% of total
unique human proteins, compared to 33% in catfishhuman alignments (Table 3). These reference numbers
indicate both the high coverage of the catfish transcriptome obtained in this project, and the limitations of
simple homology searches given the rapid divergence of
many genes following speciation and the complexity of
genome-wide and local gene duplication events within
teleost species. Given that the identity of only 37% of
the unique catfish sequences could be characterized by
homology searches, the utility of the dataset should
increase significantly with whole-genome sequencing of
Ictalurid catfish and additional sequencing in closely
related species within the order of Siluriformes. Interestingly, over 40,000 unique catfish sequences containing
an ORF did not have a significant hit by homology
searches. Further work will be needed to characterize
whether low homology rates in these sequences is due
to short read length, the rapid evolution of the encoded
gene, or ‘catfish-specific’ gene duplication and
divergence.
Large-scale EST sequences provide an enormous
resource for molecular marker development. This project allowed identification of over 20,000 microsatellites
within ESTs, of which 13,375 were located within
unique ESTs and had sufficient flanking sequences for
microsatellite primer design for genotyping (Table 6).
Therefore, these microsatellites will be a major resource
for genetic linkage and comparative mapping [12]. In
addition, over 300,000 putative SNP sites were identified, of which over 48,000 were identified from contigs
with at least four ESTs and the minor sequence was
represented at least twice (Table 7). The 48,000 filtered
SNPs should be highly useful for the development of a
SNP panel for whole genome association studies [37].
The parameters of quality SNP assessment may not be
applied to the very large contigs. The utilization of a
minor allele frequency of six for all the contigs containing 30 sequences or more resulted in higher SNP frequency from these contigs, such as 13.4 SNPs per
kilobase in the contigs with 100 to 500 sequences, and
15 SNPs per kilobase in the contigs with 500 sequences
or more. Information regarding contigs over 500
sequences can be found in Additional data file 1. High

Wang et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R8
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R8

SNP frequency within these large contigs may be caused
by the accumulation of sequencing errors or alignment
of transcripts from multi-copy loci, so SNPs from large
contigs will be avoided in future SNP genotyping.

Conclusions
In this project, generation and assembly of channel catfish and blue catfish ESTs allowed the identification of
45,306 contigs and 66,272 singletons, and a large majority of the catfish transcriptome was captured. Whole
genome sequencing of channel catfish and blue catfish
is currently underway, and the comparison between genome and transcriptome sequences will enable better
understanding of the gene structure and organization.
The analysis of the inter-specific ESTs resulted in the
identification of 20,757 gene-associated microsatellites
and over 300,000 putative SNPs, of which over 48,000
were filtered SNPs with the presence of the minor allele
at least twice. These SNPs have been utilized to design
the first generation high-density SNP chips using Illumina iSelect HD SNP genotyping panels for genome
association studies. The inter- and intra-specific SNPs
identified from the all catfish EST dataset assembly will
greatly benefit catfish introgression breeding selection
and whole genome association studies.
Materials and methods
cDNA library construction, EST sequencing and
processing

The cDNA libraries were constructed by consortium
investigators using various tissues, organs, and cell lines,
including stomach, muscle, olfactory tissue, trunk kidney, head kidney, gill, intestine, spleen, skin, liver, pituitary, ovary and testis (Table 1). Total RNA was isolated
from experimental tissues, reverse transcribed using an
oligo-dT primer, directionally cloned into either the
pSPORT-1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) or
pDNR-Lib (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View,
CA, USA) plasmid vectors, and electroporated into competent Escherichia coli. One library (CBPN) underwent
subtraction for highly expressed clones, ten libraries
were normalized, and one library (CBCZ) was processed
without normalization. Clone selection, arraying, and
sequencing of all 12 libraries were performed at the US
Dept. of Energy - Joint Genome Institute. Both ends of
the insert were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator
(V3.1) chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA), and low quality sequences were trimmed. Contaminant sequences (E. coli, mitochondrial, cloning vector, rRNA, tRNA) were filtered.
EST assembly

Three separate assemblies were performed: blue catfish
ESTs, channel catfish ESTs, and all catfish ESTs. The

Page 12 of 14

new EST sequences and existing EST sequences from
channel catfish and blue catfish were clustered and
assembled using the Paracel Transcript Assembler,
based on the CAP3 assembler [38]. Repeat sequences
and poly (A) tails were masked and annotated. Prior to
assembly, all EST sequences were compared to ‘seed’
sequences, which were existing catfish full-length or
partial cDNA sequences in GenBank. New sequences
sharing 80% similarity to seed sequences were clustered
and assembled at 95% identity with at least a 50-bp
overlap to generate seed-cluster contigs. The seed cluster assembly reduced the number of sequences for final
assembly in order to minimize computational requirements. The remaining EST sequences were then clustered based on local similarity scores of pairwise
comparisons with a minimum 88% similarity of at least
100 bp. Clusters containing only one sequence were
denoted as singletons. The EST clusters were assembled
into contiguous sequences (contigs) by multiplesequence alignment with 95% identity of at least a 50-bp
overlap, and a consensus sequence was generated for
each cluster. Multiple contigs could be generated from
each cluster, since EST clusters may not share enough
similarity over their entire length to be assembled as a
single contig. Multiple contigs could also be generated
when ESTs in the cluster represented splice variant
forms or paralogs. Single ESTs remaining in a cluster
after the formation of contigs were designated as cluster
singletons. The unique sequences for each assembly
included the seed-cluster contigs, cluster contigs, cluster
singletons, and singletons. All the sequence assemblies
are available upon request to the corresponding author.
ORF searching, gene identification and gene ontology
annotation

All unique sequences obtained after the assembly were
analyzed by ESTScan [39] to search for ORFs, which
could be used to distinguish coding and non-coding
sequences [39,40]. The putative protein sequences were
also generated at the same time by ESTscan, which
could be used to analyze splice variation, determine
paralogs, and assess gene families. All unique sequences
were compared against the nr and Uniprot databases
using BLASTX (cutoff E-value of 1E-10) to obtain the
putative identity. The NCBI Refseq protein and Ensemble databases (zebrafish, medaka, Tetraodon, human,
mouse, and chicken) were also used to annotate the
unique catfish genes.
Full length cDNA identification

Putative full-length cDNAs were identified by comparison to full-length genes and start signals in Uniprot
databases using TargetIdentifier [34,41] with a cutoff Evalue of 1E-5. Once the start codon (ATG) and poly (A)

Wang et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R8
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R8

tail were identified, the cDNA sequence was considered
a full-length cDNA.
Microsatellite and SNP marker identification

All the unique sequences were used to search for microsatellite makers using Msatfinder [42] with a repeat
threshold of eight di-nucleotide repeats or five tri-, tetrapenta-, or hexa-nucleotide repeats. Clones containing 50bp sequence on both sides of the microsatellite repeat
were considered sufficient for primer design [43].
All three assemblies were used for SNP identification
using autoSNP [44]. The parameters for minimum minor
allele frequency for SNP detection varied with the number of sequences in the contig. A sequence variation was
declared a SNP when: a mismatch was identified in contigs with four or fewer sequences; the minor allele
sequence existed at least twice within contigs containing
5 to 6 sequences; the minor allele sequence existed at
least three times within contigs containing 7 to 8
sequences; the minor allele sequence existed at least four
times within contigs containing 9 to 12 sequences, or the
minor allele sequence existed at least five times within
contigs with 13 or more sequences. One thousand contigs containing filtered SNPs were randomly selected to
inspect the inter- and intra-specific SNP calls.
