subunit of Mycoplasma pneumoniae

Abstract
Background: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is responsible for acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) common in
children and young adults. As M. pneumoniae is innately resistant to b-lactams antibiotics usually given as the firstline treatment for RTIs, specific and early diagnosis is important in order to select the right treatment. Serology is
the most used diagnostic method for M. pneumoniae infections.
Results: In this study, we identified the M. pneumoniae ATP synthase beta subunit (AtpD) by serologic proteome
analysis and evaluated its usefulness in the development of a serological assay. We successfully expressed and
purified recombinant AtpD (rAtpD) protein, which was recognised by serum samples from M. pneumoniae-infected
patient in immunoblots. The performance of the recombinant protein rAtpD was studied using a panel of serum
samples from 103 infected patients and 86 healthy blood donors in an in-house IgM, IgA and IgG enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results of this assay were then compared with those of an in-house ELISA with a
recombinant C-terminal fragment of the P1 adhesin (rP1-C) and of the commercial Ani Labsystems ELISA kit using
an adhesin P1-enriched whole-cell extract. Performances of the rAtpD and rP1-C antigen combination were further
assessed by binary logistic regression analysis. We showed that combination of rAtpD and rP1-C discriminated
maximally between the patients infected with M. pneumoniae (children and adults) and the healthy subjects for
the IgM class, performing better than the single recombinant antigens or the commercial whole-cell extract.
Conclusion: These results suggest that AtpD can be used as an antigen for the immunodiagnosis of early and
acute M. pneumoniae infection in association with adhesin P1, providing an excellent starting point for the
development of point-of-care diagnostic assays.

Background
Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a cell wall-less bacterium
belonging to the Mollicutes class, which invades the
human host respiratory epithelium by adhering with a
tip-like attachment organelle. Several proteins, including
the major surface adhesins P1, P30, P116 and proteins
HMW1 to HMW3, as well as proteins A, B and C,
interact to constitute this tip-like attachment organelle
[1-5]. M. pneumoniae causes atypical pneumonia and
other respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as

tracheobronchitis, and is responsible for up to 20% of
all cases of community-acquired pneumonia, especially
among school-aged children and young adults [6,7].
M. pneumoniae is intrinsically resistant to betalactams antibiotics usually given as the first-line
treatment of RTIs. Macrolides and related antibiotics
represent the treatment of choice for M. pneumoniae
respiratory infections. Therefore, an early and specific
diagnosis is necessary to give the patient the correct
antibiotic treatment.
Serology, including the complement fixation test
(CFT) and different enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISA), is the most common laboratory method
used for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection
although culture methods and PCR are also performed.
The CFT may have limited value because it also

measures antibodies derived from earlier infections and
antibodies to M. pneumoniae glycolipid antigens; thus, it
can react with antigens of different origins [7]. Previous
studies comparing the CFT to the PCR detection of
M. pneumoniae, however found good sensitivity and
specificity for the CFT [8,9]. Many ELISA-based assays,
using protein extracts, membrane preparations, glycolipid extracts or whole cell lysates have been developed
for the detection of M. pneumoniae infection [8]. In particular, good sensitivity has been observed for assays
with P1 adhesin-enriched extracts [8,10,11]. In a study
by Beersma et al. [8], 12 commercial serologic assays for
M. pneumoniae specific immunoglobulins M and G and
the CFT were evaluated with PCR used as the “gold
standard”. The IgM assay that showed the best sensitivity and specificity were from the Ani Labsystems (77%
and 92%, respectively) corresponding to P1-enriched
extracts. Other studies have reported the superiority of
assays using the P1-enriched antigen on the basis of a
comparison of the strength of the immune response
[9,11,12]. Nonetheless in the same studies, high IgG seroprevalence has been observed in the control sera ranging from 36% (Virotech assay) to 93% (Ani Labsystems
assay). The variability of the ELISA results observed in
these studies suggests the need for improved sensitivity
and specificity among commercialised serological assays
used to detect M. pneumoniae infection [8].
Recently, many studies have reported great interest in
using a recombinant protein corresponding to the Cterminal portion of the P1 adhesin, which has been
described as the immunodominant antigen in M. pneumoniae [2,13-17]. Antigenic properties of recombinant
proteins P116 and P30 have also been shown [15,18,19].
A combination of frequently recognized antigens could
be useful for diagnostic purposes. Thus, the identification of antigenic M. pneumoniae RTI-related proteins
appears to be a prerequisite for the development of
serological test kits based on recombinant antigens.
In this study, we used serologic proteome analysis of
M. pneumoniae M129 total extracts to simultaneously
identify candidate antigens inducing an antibody
response [20]. We focused on the ATP synthase beta
subunit (AtpD) of M. pneumoniae as it was likely to
generate an antibody response in M. pneumoniaeinfected children and adults at an early stage of infection. The atpD gene (mpn598) contains an open reading
frame of 1,428 nucleotides and encodes a protein of
475 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of
52,486 Da [21-23]. It was cloned and expressed in
E. coli to obtain recombinant protein. We then compared the serological performance of this antigen with a
previously described recombinant C-terminal fragment
of the P1 adhesin (rP1-C) [2,13,15], using in-house
IgM, IgA and IgG ELISAs and the commercial Ani

Labsystems ELISA that uses an adhesin P1-enriched
whole extract. We further evaluated the performance of
the combination rAtpD and rP1-C IgM by binary logistic regression analysis to compare results between the
recombinant antigens, either alone or together, and the
enriched whole extract.

Results
Identification of the AtpD antigen by serologic proteome
analysis

The total protein fraction obtained from the M. pneumoniae M129 strain was separated by two dimensional
gel electrophoresis (2D-E) (Fig. 1A) and the staining pattern of the 2D immunoblots was probed with 10 different serums samples from patients with RTIs (Fig. 1B) or
healthy blood donors (Fig. 1C). The protein identities of
six spots that were detected by at least one of the serum
samples from the 10 RTI patients were determined
using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry following in-gel
tryptic digestion (Table 1). Of the six proteins identified,
four (P1 protein, enolase, the ATP synthase beta subunit
and the pyruvate dehydrogenase beta subunit) were
highly detected by serum samples from patients (Fig.
1B), but only two proteins, the P1 protein and the ATP
synthase beta subunit, showed no reactivity with serum
samples from healthy blood donors (Fig. 1C).
Expression, characterization and purification of rAtpD and
rP1-C proteins

The atpD gene and the C-terminal fragment of p1 were
amplified by PCR and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)
cells after cloning into the expression vector pDEST 17.
These proteins were further purified by affinity column
and ion exchange chromatography. The expression and
purification of the rAtpD and rP1-C proteins were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot (Fig. 2). Two
irrelevant purified his-tagged recombinant proteins of
the same mass as rAtpD (Fig. 2, lane 6) and rP1-C (Fig.
2, lane 7) were included in the analysis. Both rAtpD and
rP1-C were successfully expressed in E. coli (Fig. 2A,
lane 2 for rAtpD and lane 3 for rP1 -C) and purified
with a purity estimated to be 100% by densitometry
(Fig. 2A, lane 4 for rAtpD and lane 5 for rP1-C). The
apparent molecular masses of rAtpD and rP1-C were
about 40 and 50 kDa, respectively, in agreement with
the theoretical values.
The rAtpD and rP1-C proteins were both recognised
by pooled M. pneumoniae-positive serum samples (Fig.
2B, lanes 2 and 4 for rAtpD, lanes 3 and 5 for rP1-C),
but not by healthy blood donors (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 4
for rAtpD, lanes 3 and 5 for rP1-C). The two irrelevant
proteins were not recognised by serum samples from
either patients or healthy blood donors (Fig. 2B and 2C,

recombinant proteins are antigenic.

Labelled spots represent the M. pneumoniae antigenic proteins that
were detected with serum samples from the study population. The
gel spots were encoded using a protein number (Table 1), which
was assigned based on their similar locations on different gels/
membranes.

Serum samples from 103 patients (54 children, 49
adults) with M. pneumoniae RTIs and 86 healthy blood
donors were screened for anti-M. pneumoniae IgM, IgA
and IgG antibodies using an in-house ELISA with
rAtpD and rP1-C (Tables 2 and 3). We set positive criteria as a value above the cut-off determined by receiver
operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis. The cutoff values of the IgM, IgA and IgG ELISA tests were
determined as an absorbance value of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4,
respectively, for rAtpD, and of 0.4, 0.5 and 0.4, respectively for rP1-C. The rAtpD protein demonstrated a
higher discriminating score (0.842 ≤ area under curve
(AUC) ≤ 0.943) than rP1-C for all of the Ig classes
in children and adults (Tables 2 and 3). Among the
54 serum samples from children tested, 38 (70%)
showed a high IgM titre compared with rAtpD, whereas
30 (56%) were IgA-positive and 42 (78%) were IgG-positive. Serum samples from 38 (70%) children were positive for IgM against the rP1-C protein, whereas
27 (50%) and 37 (69%) were IgA- and IgG-positive,
respectively (Table 2). Out of the 49 serum samples
from adults infected with M. pneumoniae, 33 (67%) and
22 (45%) tested positive for IgM antibodies against the
rAtpD and rP1-C proteins, respectively. Of these samples, 32 (65%) and 27 (55%) reacted with the rAtpD and
rP1-C proteins, respectively, for the IgA class, whereas
30 (61%) and 22 (45%) were IgG-positive for the rAtpD
and rP1-C proteins, respectively (Table 3). Specificity
values ranging from 90% to 97% were found for IgM,
IgA and IgG rAtpD and rP1-C protein ELISAs, meaning
that no more than 3% to 10% of the serum samples
from healthy donors had absorbance values above the
cut-off (Tables 2 and 3).
Serum samples from 39 (72%) children and 24 (49%)
adults were IgM-positive based on the Ani Labsystems
ELISA. The IgA and IgG Ani Labsystems EIA assays
showed the best sensitivity for serum samples from both
children and adult patients, with IgA being detected in
46 (85%) children and 48 (98%) adults and IgG being
detected in 52 (96%) children and 48 (98%) adults
(Tables 2 and 3). It should be noted that although the
IgM Ani Labsystems showed good specificity for children and adults (92%), its specificity for IgA and IgG
were much lower, at 56% and 29%, respectively (Tables
2 and 3). Indeed, 44% (38/86) and 71% (61/86) of the
blood donor serum samples were found to be positive
by the IgA and IgG Ani Labsystems commercial kits,
respectively (Tables 2 and 3).

For the three ELISA tests, a significant increase in
IgM, between two- and three-fold, was detected between
the first (acute-phase serum) and second of the six
paired serum samples. A two-fold increase in the IgA
and IgG responses was also seen between the first and
second samples (data not shown).
Statistical analysis of the rAtpD - rP1 combination

To evaluate whether a combination of multiple antigens
increased the ability to distinguish patients with RTIs
from healthy donors, we compared the seroreactivity
with a single antigen (rAtpD or rP1-C protein) to a combination of these antigens and to a P1-enriched total
extract from the Ani Labsystems kit (Tables 2 and 3,
Fig. 3 and 4).
The AUC score increased with the number of recognised antigens, going from 0.854 for a single recognised

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

antigen to 0.925 for two recognised antigens for IgM
class in children and from 0.708 to 0.923 for the IgM
class in adults. Moreover, the AUC scores of the combination of the IgM class were higher in children and
adults than the respective scores seen with the Ani
Labsystems kit (Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 3 and 4).
The rAtpD - rP1-C ELISA IgM combination showed
the best sensitivity, detecting 40 (74%) and 39 (80%) of
the serum samples from infected children and adults,
respectively, compared with the sensitivity obtained with
the recombinant antigens alone or the P1-enriched total
extract from the Ani Labsystems kit (Tables 2 and 3,
Fig. 3 and 4). Combination of the two antigens primarily
improved the IgM sensitivity for adult serum samples
(Table 3, Fig. 4).
The best sensitivity for the detection of IgG and IgA
in serum samples from children and adults sera was

confirmed as the main antigen for the immunodiagnosis
of M. pneumoniae infections [13,16].
This work reports the first immunoproteomic study
for M. pneumoniae, leading to the identification of new
antigenic proteins such as the ATP synthase beta subunit, enolase, the pyruvate dehydrogenase beta subunit
(PDH-B) and fructose bisphosphate aldolase. Antibodies
against the GroEl protein have previously been reported
in serum samples from patients with RTIs [24]. All of
the antigens described in this study, except the enolase
protein, were previously described as “proteins of the
Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of M. pneumoniae“ [25].
These proteins may be associated or bound to a cytoskeleton-like structure, which could provide the necessary framework to maintain and stabilize the shape of
M. pneumoniae [26], to allow motility [27] and to allow
the formation of an asymmetric cell. The correct assembly of this organelle is a prerequisite for the binding of
M. pneumoniae to specific receptors on the host cell
[28,29]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
enolase and the PDH-B protein in addition to their

major biosynthetic and metabolic roles in the cytoplasm,
could be translocated to the surface to serve as plasminogen- and fibronectin-binding proteins, respectively,
facilitating interactions between mycoplamas and the
extracellular matrix [30,31]. Thus, these data suggest a
pivotal role for these proteins in the infection mechanism of M. pneumoniae.
Serologic proteome analysis showed that the AtpD
and the P1 proteins were highly detected by serum samples from patients with RTIs and not from healthy
blood donors. The other proteins identified were less
able to discriminate between patients and controls as
they were lightly antigenic to blood donors (confirmed
with further ELISA studies, data not shown). Thus the
AtpD and the rP1-C proteins were selected for further
serological study focusing on comparisons of the performance of assays using these recombinant proteins with
assays using adhesin P1-enriched total extracts such as
the commercial Ani Labsystems kit.
To this end, the atpD gene and the P1-C sequence
were cloned, expressed in E. coli, and purified. The

EIA tests for IgA and IgG. In particular, 80% of the
serum samples from infected adult were found to be
IgM-positive by the combination of the two antigens
compared with 70%, 44% and 48% by rAtpD alone, rP1C alone and the Ani Labsystems assay, respectively
(Table 3). Previous studies have shown that young people tend to have higher level of IgM antibodies in acute
infections, while adults may lack IgM during this phase
[7]. In recent studies, however, most of the IgM assays
tested showed inaccurate sensitivity ranging from 30 to

serological performance of the two recombinant proteins either alone or in combination (logistic regression
analysis), and of the Ani Labsystems kit were further
compared using a panel of 103 serum samples from
M. pneumoniae-infected patients (54 children and
49 adults) and 86 serum samples from healthy blood
donors. The rAtpD protein-based assay, either alone or
in combination with rP1-C, identified more patient
serum samples (children or adults) than the Ani Labsystems test for IgM, but fewer than the Ani Labsystems

80% [8,32]. Thus the good sensitivity of the rAtpD rP1-C combination, especially in adults, seems promising and could be suitable for a rapid IgM assay [33].
When studying responses of healthy blood donors, the
rAtpD or rP1-C or rAtpD-rP1-C based assay detected a
few sera positive for IgM, IgA and IgG. In contrast, a
high number was detected positive with the IgA and
IgG-EIA Ani Labsystems assays. Such a high IgG seroprevalence in the control serum samples has been
observed in previous studies with the same kit [8,12],
suggesting the possibility of false-positive results for that
assay. The evaluation of the performance of IgG assays,
however, is complicated by the lack of information on
previous M. pneumoniae infections for the control
serum samples. As described in a previous study of the
prevalence of M. pneumoniae IgG and IgA antibodies in
a healthy population [34], the seroprevalence increases
with age but doesn’t exceed 58% for IgG or 28% for
IgA, even among the ederly. The elevated levels of specific M. pneumoniae IgG antibodies may be caused by
past M. pneumoniae infections [32,35]. In addition, a
variety of non specific antibodies may develop in association with M. pneumoniae infection due to the
sequence homology of adhesin proteins and glycolipids
of the M. pneumoniae cell membrane with mammalian
tissues [7,12].
The IgA and IgG assays using recombinant proteins
(alone or in combination) may lack sensitivity compared
to the results obtained with the commercial assay.
Nonetheless, the use of recombinant proteins may be
more specific than the whole extract used in the Ani
Labsystems assays, avoiding the detection of cross-reactive antibodies to M. pneumoniae. Many studies have
reported the advantage of using a purified recombinant
protein in serodiagnosis arguing that better defined antigen preparations should give more accurate results and
should be more specific than the use of a glycolipid or
whole-cell antigen [17,36,37].
Preliminary cross-reactivity studies were performed to
assess the specificity of the rAtpD ELISA assay and
showed weak cross-reactivity with other organisms
involved in respiratory disease, including S. pneumoniae,
C. pneumoniae and C. psittaci, L. pneumophila, B. pertussis and C. burnetii. Three serum samples from C.
pneumoniae-infected patients and two serums samples
from S. pneumoniae-infected patients were detected by
the rAtpD assay. This could have been due to antigenically similar epitopes, but we could not exclude the possibility of co-infection as these serum samples were
found to be positive by the rP1-C assay, as well (data
not shown). These data suggest a low risk of cross-reactivity of this assay with an immune response to other
respiratory tract bacterial infections, but more RTI
serum samples should be tested to confirm these results.

Page 8 of 13

The false-positive results could be also explained by
cross-reactivity between the rAtpD proteins of M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium, a phylogenetically closely
related species to M. pneumoniae. However, we were
not able to collect and study some serum samples from
M. genitalium-infected patients as the diagnosis of these
infections is only based on molecular methods. It would
be very interesting to further include some serum samples from M. genitalium-infected patient in the study.

Conclusion
In summary, this study presents a new antigen, AtpD,
that could contribute to improvements in the diagnosis
of M. pneumoniae infection in the early and acute phase
and could be more specific than the commercial assays
using complex extracts. We have shown that the combination of rAtpD with rP1-C antigen to detect IgM contributed to improvements in the early specific diagnosis
of M. pneumoniae infection. Indeed, several studies have
recently reported that combination of selected antigens
provide higher sensitivity than single antigens [38].
Methods
Organisms and growth conditions

The M. pneumoniae reference strain M129 (ATCC
29342) was cultured in SP4 medium containing phenol
red used as pH indicator. Tissue culture flasks (Nunc)
were incubated at 37°C and inspected daily for colour
changes. The exponential growth phase was indicated by
a colour change in medium from red to orange-yellow.
The cells were harvested at this stage and washed in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the pellet was
stored at -20°C.
Patients and healthy blood donors

From January 2004 to December 2006, serum samples
were retrospectively selected from 103 patients (54 children, 1-15 years of age and 49 adults, 17-82 years of
age), admitted to Pellegrin hospital (Bordeaux, France),
Cochin hospital (Paris, France), and Raymond Poincaré
hospital (Garches, France) with a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae RTI. All of the serum samples were found to be
positive for M. pneumoniae by serodiagnosis, along with
a positive direct diagnosis for some patients, with either
culture or PCR. Depending on the laboratory where the
M. pneumoniae serodiagnosis was done, the serological
methods used were either the CFT (Virion Antigen) and
a commercial IgM ELISA test (Platelia EIA, Bio-Rad,
ImmunoCard Mycoplasma Test, Meridian) or a combination of IgM and IgG ELISAs (ImmunoWell IgM, IgG
EIA, BMD). Six paired serum samples were collected
with an acute-phase sample and a convalescent sample
obtained at least two weeks after the first sample. A
control group consisting of 86 single serum samples

Nuyttens et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:216
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/216

from healthy adult blood donors included in the study
was obtained from the French establishment of blood
(Rungis, France) and diagnosed as M. pneumoniae-negative by the CFT and an IgM ELISA test (Platelia, Bio-Rad).
Furthermore, the specificity of the rAtpD protein-based
ELISAs was assessed using 55 additional serum samples,
18 that were positive for a C. pneumoniae infection
(National Reference Center for Chlamydiae, Université
Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, France), 10 that were positive
for a L. pneumophila infection (National Reference Center for Legionella, Université Lyon 1, France), 10 that
were positive for a C. burnetii infection (Pellegrin hospital, Bordeaux, France), 8 that were from patients harboring a S. pneumoniae RTI (Raymond Poincaré hospital,
Garches, France), 8 that were positive for a B. pertussis
infection (Marcel Merieux Laboratory, Lyon, France), and
1 that was positive for a C. psittaci infection (National
Reference Center for Chlamydiae, Université Victor
Segalen Bordeaux 2, France). The present project is in
compliance with the Helsinki Declaration (Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects).
The study was done in accordance with the guidelines of
the ethical committees of the participating hospitals. In
each hospital, specimens were collected as part of the
routine management of patients without any additional
sampling, and patients provided no objection for their
samples to be used. According to the French legacy, this
study did not need to be examined by the French
“Comité pour la Protection des Personnes” and allowed
the exemption of patient’s written informed consent. All
patient data shown in the present work were anonymously reported, without offering any possibility to
trace the actual patients.
2D-E

The bacterial pellet were suspended in rehydratation
solution (Ready-Prep 2-D Rehydratation/Sample Buffer
1, Bio-Rad) composed of 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 1%
(wt/vol) ASB-14 detergent, 40 mM Tris, 4% 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfate
(CHAPS), 0.2% (vol/vol) immobilised pH gradient (IPG)
buffer, pH 3-10, 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and
0.002% bromophenol blue. Cell lysis was performed by
sonication three times 20 s (Branson Sonifier), and the
un-disrupted cells were removed by centrifugation
(20,817 × g; 45 min; 21°C). Total protein concentration
was determined using a 2-D Quant kit (GE Healthcare)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein concentration was calculated using bovine serum
albumin (BSA) as a standard.
Isoelectric focusing was performed using the Protean
IEF Cell system and Immobilised pH gradient (IPG)
strips with a pH range of 5-8 (Bio-Rad). Two hundred
and fifty μg of the protein samples in 150 μl of

Page 9 of 13

rehydratation solution was used to rehydrate the IPG
strips (7 cm, pH 5-8) overnight at 20°C under mineral
oil. The proteins were focused for 10 kVh with a maximum voltage of 4,000 V at 20°C. After focusing, the
strips were incubated for 10 min in 2 mL of equilibration buffer I (6 M urea, 2% SDS, 375 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.8, 20% glycerol, 130 mM DTT), followed by equilibration buffer II (6 M urea, 2% SDS, 375 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.8, 20% glycerol, 135 mM iodoacetamide). The equilibrated IPG strips were then drained and embedded on
top of 12.5% acrylamide gels, and electrophoresis was
carried out at 25 V for 20 min, and at 180 V for 6 h.
Protein molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were used.
Proteins were visualised by staining with Coomassie
blue. Gel images were captured by a GS-800 densitometer (Bio-Rad). Replicate gels were generated from
two independent experiments, and one representative
gel is shown. The control immunoblot was incubated
with the secondary antibody without any human serum
and failed to yield any signal.
Western blot

For western blot analysis, the proteins separated by electrophoresis were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Bio-Rad) [39] and blocked in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) containing 3% non-fat dry milk.
The membranes were probed with anti-M. pneumoniae
antibody-positive pooled human serum or healthy blood
donor pooled serum (n = 10) at a dilution of 1:500 in
blocking buffer. The blots were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Goat anti-human alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as
secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution). Blots were then
incubated with p-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidium salt
(BCIP) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) until colour development had reached the desired level (2 to 3 min).
Protein identification and mass spectrometry

Selected protein spots were excised from the 2D-E gels
using a sterile scalpel and placed into 96 well plates.
The gel pieces were further subjected to in-gel tryptic
digestion as previously described [40] with minor modifications. The gel pieces were washed three times in
MilliQ water, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and dried in a
vacuum centrifuge. They were then rehydrated at 4°C
for 15 min in digestion buffer containing 50 mM
NH4HCO3 and 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (modified sequencing
grade, Promega). The supernatant was replaced with
30 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3, and the samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. Digested peptides contained in
the supernatant were purified using a home-made
micropurification column containing 0.1 μl of 20R2
reversed-phased material (PerSeptive Biosystems) packed

Nuyttens et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:216
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/216

in a Gel-Loader tip (Eppendorf) and equilibrated with
1% trifluoroacetic acid. Ten μl of the supernatant was
then loaded onto the column. After washing with 1%
trifluoroacetic acid, the adsorbed peptides were eluted
directly onto a MALDI target (MTP AnchorChip 600/
384, Bruker Daltonik) with 0.8 μl of 70% acetonitrile
and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing saturated alphacyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonik). Mass
fingerprints were acquired with a MALDI-TOF/TOF
mass spectrometer (Ultraflex; Bruker Daltonik) and processed with FlexAnalysis 2.2 software and ProteinScape
1.3 (Bruker Daltonik). After internal calibration with
trypsin autodigestion peptides, the monoisotopic masses
of the tryptic peptides were used to query NCBInr
sequence databases (215, 9330197 sequences) using the
Mascot search algorithm (Mascot server version 2.2;
http://www.matrixscience.com). The search conditions
used were as followed: maximum mass error of 70 ppm,
one missed cleavage allowed, modification of cysteines
by iodoacetamide, and methionine oxidation as variable
modification. Identifications were based on the MASCOT score, observed pI and mass (kDa), number of
matching peptide masses and total percentage of the
amino acid sequence covered by the peptides. Sequence
coverage ranged from 16% to 80%.
PCR amplification, cloning and expression of the atpD
gene and the C-terminal fragment of the p1 gene (rP1-C)
of M. pneumoniae M129

Sequence cloning was done using the Gateway® technology. This technology allows the efficient transfer of DNA
fragments into plasmids while maintaining the reading
frame, using a set of recombination sequences, “Gateway
att” sites, and two enzymes termed LR Clonase and BP
Clonase. Recombination sequences must be introduced
to the DNA fragments before cloning into Gateway® vectors. Genomic DNA was extracted from M. pneumoniae
M129 with the DNA easy tissue kit (Qiagen) and used as
a template for PCR amplification of the atpD gene
(mpn598, nucleotide positions 5′-719548-720975-3′ on
the complementary strand) and the C-terminal fragment
of the p1 gene (mpn141) encompassing amino acid residues 1159-1519 (nucleotide positions 5′-184335-1854183′). No codon changes were required for expression of
the sequences in E. coli. The following forward and
reverse primers were used for the amplification of
the atpD gene: 5′-AAAAAAGCAGGCTTGAAAAAGGAAAACATTACATACG-3′ (F a ) and reverse 5′AGAAAGCTGGGTTTTCTCCTCAACAGTAG-3′ (Ra).
The following forward and reverse primers were used
for the amplification of the p1 gene: 5′-AAAAAAGCAGGCTTGCGGCCTTTCGTGGCAGTTG-3′ (F p )
and reverse 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTGGTCACTGGTTAAACCGGAC-3′ (Rp). The 13 and 12 first nucleotides

Page 10 of 13

of forward and reverse primers, respectively, represented
the first recombination sequence necessary for Gateway®
cloning. Other nucleotides of the Fa, Ra and Fp, Rp primers represent atpD and p1 sequences, respectively. PCR
was performed in a 25-μl reaction containing 0.075 U/μl
of Triple Master polymerase (Eppendorf), 2.5 μl of High
Fidelity Buffer with Mg 2+ , 200 μM dNTPs, 200 nM of
each primer and 70 ng of extracted DNA. The reaction
conditions were standardised at an initial denaturation of
94°C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 50 s,
54°C for 50 s, and 72°C for 1 min 20 s. A final extension
was done at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were analysed
in a 1% agarose gel and purified using a QIA-quick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen). A second PCR using the same
conditions was performed to introduce the second
recombination sequence necessary for Gateway® cloning
by using 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT-3′ (F g ) as the forward primer and 5′GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3 (Rg)
as the reverse primer. After purification, the PCR products were inserted into the Gateway® expression vector
pDEST17, as previously described [41]. The inserts were
then sequenced to rule out any mutations.
The ligation mixtures were transformed into E. coli
DH5a competent cells. Transformants were selected on
LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the positive clones were confirmed by colony PCR with the Fg
and Rg primers. Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive
clones from overnight cultures using a Midi plasmid
purification kit (Qiagen). Fifty ng of plasmid DNA was
transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and cells containing the recombinant plasmids were grown in 17 ml of
LB broth (containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml
chloramphenicol) to an optical density at 600 nm
(OD 600 ) of 0.3. Protein expression was induced by
0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside,
Sigma-Aldrich). Once the OD600 had reached 1, the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and further subjected to SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli [42] and
western blot to evaluate the expression and antigenicity
of the expressed recombinant proteins. The two proteins
were found to be expressed in inclusion bodies. The
expression protocol was specifically designed to increase
the quantity of expressed recombinant proteins in order
to facilitate further purification. Bacterial growth was
monitored by measuring absorbance at 600 nm. No
toxic effect due to the over-expressed recombinant
proteins was observed on E. coli cells.
Purification of recombinant rAtpD and rP1-C proteins

For large-scale production of recombinant proteins, 2l of
culture of E. coli cells expressing rAtpD and rP1-C were
grown and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After induction,
the bacterial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at

Nuyttens et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:216
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/216

5,251 × g for 6 min at 4°C and resuspended in 60 ml of
lysis buffer (20 mM Tris HCl, pH8, 0.5 M sucrose,
100 mM EDTA, pH8, 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). After incubation on ice
for 45 min, the tubes were centrifuged at 15,557 × g at
4°C for 10 min. The pellets were frozen at -20°C until
purification. The cells were then sonicated three times
with a 20 s pulse at 1-min intervals on ice in a sonication buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM triethanolamine, pH8,
500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF). The
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,557 × g for
45 min with a buffer containing 20 mM triethanolamine,
pH8, 500 mM NaCl and 0.25 M imidazole and then
subsequently using buffers with the same composition
containing 1 M and 8 M urea. These three “wash steps”
were used to eliminate the majority of E. coli contaminants before purification. The supernatant of the final
step containing the protein of interest was filtered and
loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) at 4°C.
The proteins were eluted from the column by applying
a gradient of 0.25 to 0.5 M imidazole in a buffer containing 8 M urea, 20 mM triethanolamine, pH8,
500 mM NaCl. Fractions containing the recombinant
protein in large quantities without contaminants were
pooled and dialyzed against an ion exchange buffer
(6 M urea, 20 mM triethanolamine, pH8) overnight
using a nitrocellulose dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por®membrane kit, http://www.spectrumlabs.com) before
loading onto a HiTrap ion exchange Q column (GE
Healthcare). The proteins were eluted by applying a gradient of 0 to 1 M NaCl in ion exchange buffer. The
fractions containing the recombinant proteins with a
high degree of purity were pooled and dialyzed against a
storage buffer (6 M urea, 20 mM triethanolamine, pH8,
300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA). The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method [43]. The
fractions were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and the
purity of purified recombinant proteins was estimated
by densitometry (Quantity one software, GS 800 densitometer, Bio-Rad). The purified proteins were instantaneously used for ELISA analysis, the proteins were then
conserved no longer than one month in storage buffer.
ELISAs with purified recombinant proteins rAtpD, rP1-C
and commercial Ani Labsystems kit

Serum samples collected from children and adult
patients with M. pneumoniae RTIs and from healthy
blood donors were screened for anti-M. pneumoniae
IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies by in-house ELISAs with
the rP1-C and rAtpD proteins. Preadsorption of IgG
rheumatoid factor was performed before each IgM
ELISA test. The purified proteins were diluted by successive steps in PBS to avoid potentially damaging crystallisation of the urea in our ELISA washer automates.

Page 11 of 13

No precipitation of proteins was observed. Control
ELISA tests were performed at different urea concentrations ranging from 8 M to 0.1 M. The reactivity of the
two recombinant proteins was not affected by stepwise
dilution as the variation of the ELISA values with control serum samples was insignificant. The 96-well Maxisorp microtitre EIA plates (Nunc) were coated in
triplicate with 50 ng per well of rP1-C or rAtpD in PBS.
The plates were incubated overnight at 4°C and blocked
in 250 μl blocking buffer (4% bovine serum albumin in
PBS with 5 mM EDTA) at 37°C for 1 h. After washing
three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the
antigen-coated wells were incubated sequentially for
30 min at 37°C with 1:100-diluted test sera, along with
1:50,000 dilution of peroxidase-labelled goat anti-human
IgM, or IgA, or a 1:200,000 dilution of peroxidaselabelled goat anti-human IgG (Pierce). Plates were
washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween
20 between incubations. The enzyme reaction was
developed with 100 μl of TMB (tetramethylbenzidine)
substrate (Medac) for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was
stopped by adding 100 μl of 2 M H 2 SO 4 . The plates
were read by photometric reading at 450 nm using an
Opsys MR microplate reader (Dynex). “Blank” wells
containing no patient or control serum were included in
each assay. No high background was observed (OD450 ≤
0.05). Panels of serum samples from 103 patients and 86
healthy blood donors were screened for anti-M. pneumoniae IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies using the corresponding Ani Labsystems EIA kits according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis

All results were analysed with the Tanagra software
1.4.31 (http://chirouble.univ-lyon2.fr/~ricco/tanagra/fr/
tanagra.html). The accuracy of the serological assays in
discriminating disease cases from normal cases was evaluated by using ROC curve plots [44]. ROC plots were
calculated by expressing the relationship between the
fraction “correctly identified to be positive” and the fraction “falsely identified to be positive” for every possible
cut-off point selected to discriminate between the
patients and the blood donors. The AUC is a measure
of the assay efficiency to discriminate the “true positives” from the “true negatives”. The cut-off values for
every in-house serological assay were determined for
maximum efficiency of the test. A sample was considered positive if the antibody titre exceeded the defined
cut-off value. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed before evaluating the performance of the antigen
combination by ROC plots as described above. Sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
were calculated for rAtpD and rP1-C antigens, either
alone or in combination. The calculation of cut-off

values and the interpretation of the results of the Ani
Labsystems kits were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
