relied on criteria based on increasing complexity of body plan
[1]. Thus, the traditional metazoan phylogeny clusters animals from the simplest basal forms with loose tissue organization (for example, sponges) to those having two germ layers
(dipoblastic animals, for example cnidarians), and those
developing from three germ layers (triploblastic animals,
such as the Bilateria - animals with bilateral symmetry). Bilateral animals were ordered into those lacking a coelom (the

Understanding the evolution of the great diversity of life is a
major goal in biology. Despite decades of effort by systematists, evolutionary relationships between major groups of animals still remain unresolved. The inability to cluster taxa in
monophyletic groups was originally due to the lack of morphological synapomorphies among phyla. An alternative
solution came from embryology, and animal systematics

Conclusions: The reliability of a monophyletic group clustering arthropods and nematodes was
unequivocally accepted in datasets where traces of the long-branch attraction effect were removed.
This is the first phylogenomic evidence to strongly support the 'moulting clade' hypothesis.

refereed research

Results: Through the most extensive phylogenetic analysis carried out to date, the complete
genomes of 11 eukaryotic species have been analyzed in order to find homologous sequences
derived from 18 human chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis of datasets showing an increased
adjustment to equal evolutionary rates between nematode and arthropod sequences produced a
gradual change from support for Coelomata to support for Ecdysozoa. Transition between
topologies occurred when fast-evolving sequences of Caenorhabditis elegans were removed. When
chordate, nematode and arthropod sequences were constrained to fit equal evolutionary rates, the
Ecdysozoa topology was statistically accepted whereas Coelomata was rejected.

deposited research

Background: The issue of whether coelomates form a single clade, the Coelomata, or whether
all animals that moult an exoskeleton (such as the coelomate arthropods and the pseudocoelomate
nematodes) form a distinct clade, the Ecdysozoa, is the most puzzling issue in animal systematics
and a major open-ended subject in evolutionary biology. Previous single-gene and genome-scale
analyses designed to resolve the issue have produced contradictory results. Here we present the
first genome-scale phylogenetic evidence that strongly supports the Ecdysozoa hypothesis.

acoelomates, such as platyhelminths), those with a false coelom (the pseudocoelomates, such as nematodes), and, finally,
those animals with a true coelom (the Coelomata, such as the
arthropods and chordates). This comparative developmental
theory of animal evolution dominated animal systematics for
more than 50 years [2].
Subsequently, molecular systematic studies based on small
subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) sequences began to
undermine this scenario [1]. Put briefly, the new animal phylogeny suggested that clades such as acoelomates and pseudocoelomates are artificial systematic groups. Moreover,
although the coelomate designation still remains, this clade
now contains two new lineages: the lophotrochozoa and the
Ecdysozoa [3]. The 'Ecdysozoa hypothesis' postulated that all
phyla composed of animals that grow by moulting a cuticular
exoskeleton (such as arthropods and nematodes) originate
from a common ancestor, thus forming a distinct clade. Thus,
under the Ecdysozoa hypothesis arthropods are genetically
more closely related to nematodes than to chordates. Under
the 'Coelomata hypothesis' of animal evolution, however,
arthropods are more closely related to chordates than to
nematodes.
At the heart of this systematic debate, a technical discussion
emerged surrounding the long-branch attraction effect
(LBAE), taxon sampling, and the number of characters used.
Subsequent molecular and morphological studies have been
carried out, but the controversy remains unresolved and is
presented as a multifurcation [4]. Although the use of different single-gene sequences supported the Ecdysozoa hypothesis [5-11], the analysis of dozens to hundreds of concatenated
sequences supported the Coelomata clade [12-15]. Indeed,
with an element of caution, we favored the Coelomata
hypothesis in a previous whole-genome study designed to
determine the number of characters needed to obtain a reliable topology [16]. The gene-based Ecdysozoa versus genomescale Coelomata alternative hypotheses were recently challenged by two phylogenomics studies that partly supported
the Ecdysozoa clade [17] and a paraphyletic Coelomata group
[18]. Although it is generally accepted that phylogenetic analysis of whole genomes has begun to supplement (and in some
cases improve on) phylogenetic studies previously carried out
with one or a few genes [19], all genome-wide phylogenetic
studies have failed to support the proposed new animal
phylogeny.
Here we present the first phylogenomic evidence that
strongly supports the Ecdysozoa hypothesis and at the same
time demonstrates that the LBAE biases the position of
Caenorhabditis elegans in the phylogenetic tree. We show
that by using a large number of characters and choosing a
phylogenetic weighted scheme of outgroups to test the constancy of evolutionary rates, the new animal phylogeny can be
statistically supported. Moreover, we show that both the Coelomata and the Ecdysozoa hypotheses can be supported with

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R41

the highest statistical confidence when genomic datasets are
ordered according to a gradually increased adjustment to
equal evolutionary rates between C. elegans and Drosophila
melanogaster sequences. In between, neither Ecdysozoa nor
Coelomata were sufficiently supported. To our knowledge,
this is the most extensive phylogenomic analysis carried out
to date in the number of characters and the number of
eukaryotic species involved.

Results
Dataset properties
Sequences homologous to human exon sequences were
derived from filtering tblastn search results on 11 complete
eukaryotic genomes. Because the most-criticized issue in
resolving the Ecdysozoa-Coelomata problem seems to be the
LBAE produced by the nematode species, we decided to
rearrange homologous sequences in a series of nested datasets that gradually reduced LBAE. Aligned homologous
sequences were arranged in eight datasets (Di) and concatenated in their corresponding matrices (Mi) (see Materials and
methods), such that as suffix i increases, datasets and matrices comprise a smaller number of homologous sequences
showing more similar relative branch lengths (RBL) between
C. elegans (LCe) and D. melanogaster (LDm) (Figure 1). RBL
are relative human distances.
To quantify the effect on the RBL of C. elegans of concatenating alternative homologous sequences, maximum likelihood
(ML) estimates of branch length were obtained using the starlike unrooted tree transformation for each dataset (see Materials and methods). Figure 2a shows that the RBL of C. elegans over D. melanogaster decreased by approximately 30%
continuously from dataset D1 to D8. To test whether the gradual decrease in C. elegans branch length was enough to produce statistical confidence on equal evolutionary rates
between the nematode and the arthropod sequences, relative
rate tests using two outgroup schemes were assayed on concatenated sequences (see Materials and methods). Figure 2b
shows that using Saccharomyces cerevisae as the unique outgroup species (OUG1), all the individual tests on the eight
matrices failed to detect statistical deviations (at the 5% level
family-wise) between sequences. Only when the phylogenetically weighted scheme of outgroup species (OUG2) was used
did the relative rate test detect significant deviation of clock
behavior from D1 to D5 datasets. We are therefore confident
that the arthropod and nematode concatenated sequences of
the M6, M7, and M8 matrices meet the desired clock-like conditions to test the Coelomata and Ecdysozoa hypotheses and
exclude any artifacts derived from a possible LBAE. This
result supports previous work suggesting that the genetic distance between ingroup and outgroup modifies the power of
the relative rate test [20].
To test whether concatenated matrices carry sufficient phylogenetic signal, the ML mapping method was used. The

Figure 5 shows the assessment of paired-sites tests for the two
competing trees on all the datasets. Paired-sites tests supporting topologies (p > 0.05) changed almost gradually on
datasets. Figure 5a and 5b show that the SH test is more conservative than the ELW [29]. Using matrices M1 and M2, both
tests strongly rejected the Ecdysozoa hypothesis, whereas M6,
M7, and M8 rejected the Coelomata tree. Interestingly, datasets between them did not reject any topology with sufficient
statistical evidence. We can conclude that by decreasing the
RBL of C. elegans over D. melanogaster by around 13% (Figure 2a) the LBAE favoring the Coelomata hypothesis disappears and we can confirm that under strict conditions of
clock-like behavior, the Coelomata hypothesis was strongly
rejected by paired-sites tests and bootstrap support.

To test if the shortness of the evolutionary distances between
C. elegans and D. melanogaster resulting from the above filtering method biased topology over the common ancestry of
arthropods and nematodes, we searched for chordate, arthropod, and nematode sequences showing clock-like behavior
between them. To increase the probability of finding
sequences to fit the criteria, we focused on sequences from
the most closely related chordate to the molting species, that
is, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Only 14 exon sequences
met the above criteria. A relative rate test showed that the
probability of a perfect clock-like behavior was p = 0.515 for
C. elegans and D. melanogaster, p = 0.308 for C. intestinalis
and D. melanogaster and p = 0.712 for C. intestinalis and C.
elegans. The ML mapping method showed that the concatenation of all the 810 characters carried sufficient phylogenetic
signal in the matrix to represent a strictly bifurcating tree (see
Additional data file 2). Despite the reduced number of characters, phylogenetic analysis showed significant support for
the Ecdysozoa hypothesis. Using distance and ML methods,
bootstrap values reached 97%. Moreover, the Ecdysozoa
hypothesis was accepted with a probability of p = 1.00 and p
= 0.997 when SH and ELW paired-sites tests, respectively,
were performed. Conversely, the Coelomata hypothesis was
rejected at p = 0.006 and p = 0.0023, respectively.

reports

Distance and ML phylogenetic methods were used on all the
datasets (see Materials and methods). Figure 3 shows phylogenetic reconstructions and statistical support for the two
extreme conditions of the nested datasets. Whereas the M1
matrix supported the Coelomata tree with the highest statistical confidence, M8 showed the same result for the Ecdysozoa
tree. Thus, by decreasing the RBL of C. elegans, the statistical
support switched from the Coelomata to the Ecdysozoa
hypothesis. Figure 4 shows that, whichever phylogenetic
method was used, C. elegans bootstrap support between
datasets and topologies changed in agreement with the gradual RBL decrement. Specifically, using M1 and M8 (the matrices showing the most extreme evolutionary rate conditions
for C. elegans and D. melanogaster sequences - from a clockabsent to the most adjusted behavior), the statistical support
moved from Coelomata to Ecdysozoa. The same occurred
with M2 and M7. Alternatively, using M3 and M6, only one of
the two distance and ML methods (Figure 4a,b) provided sufficient support (90% or more) to the hypothesis. Finally,
using M4 and M5, only one distance method supported Coelomata and Ecdysozoa with confidence. Given that datasets differed principally in the RBL of C. elegans over D.

melanogaster, the gradual change in topology strongly favors
an LBAE between C. elegans and the more basal species. To
test whether a paired-sites test [28] supports the bootstrap
conclusions, Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) and expected-likelihood weight (ELW) tests were evaluated on the datasets (see
Materials and methods).

compound posterior probability point (P) for all the possible
quartets of each Mi matrix could be placed, with almost equivalent values (approximately 33%), inside the corner areas of
the equilateral triangle probability surface (see Additional
data file 1). Thus, concatenated matrices derived from selecting a different number of homologous sequences contained
sufficient phylogenetic signal to represent topologies as
strictly bifurcating trees. Finally, using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [21], the statistical test of the best-fit
model of sequence evolution for each dataset was selected
from six different alternatives (see Materials and methods).
As all the models are not nested and share the same number
of parameters, the best one was that with the greatest log likelihood result. The WAG amino-acid replacement matrix [22]
adjusted for frequencies (+F), rate heterogeneity (+Γ) and
invariable sites (+I) was the best evolutionary model chosen
for all the datasets. Moreover, model-fit-data values followed
the same inequality independently of the dataset (WAG [22]
> VT [23] > BLOSUM62 [24] > JTT [25] > PAM [26] >
mtREV24 [27]), suggesting that the best models were those
that consider more distantly related amino-acid sequences.

The clade Coelomata disappears by removing fastevolving sequences of C. elegans

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R41

information

We show here that by using the fast-evolving nematode C. elegans the Ecdysozoa can be recovered using genome-scale
phylogenetic analysis. Our analysis has been performed over
the largest number of eukaryotic genomes and over the largest number of amino-acid residues ever used to test the
hypothesis. The major differences from previous genomic
approaches are threefold. First, we used a large number of
short conserved sequences (around 50 amino acids long)
derived from human homologous exon sequences. Only exon
sequences derived from eight genes, out of a total of around
100 analyzed by Blair et al. [14], were used in our analysis.
The remaining genes contained in the 18 human chromosomes did not pass the BLAST filters applied in the analysis.
Second, we arranged the dataset such that the sequences,
including those evolving faster or slower, were included if
they met the condition of equal rate of change between two

interactions

In order to discard a probable biased selection of exon
sequences favoring the Ecdysozoa hypothesis, two additional
matrices were built by removing from the original dataset
(D1) the exons in which the C. elegans sequences evolved at a
faster rate. Figure 6 shows that by removing the fastest 15% of
total exon sequences the reliability of the Coelomata hypothesis is reduced from 100% to 78%. Moreover, when the fastest
30% of all exons were removed, the topology changes to
Ecdysozoa with 90% confidence level. The change in topology
in parallel with the reduction of the C. elegans branch length
points to the LBAE as the main obstacle to obtaining the true
phylogenetic relationship between chordates, arthropods and
nematodes. We conclude that the Ecdysozoa hypothesis does
not depend on adjusting a particular set of homologous exon
sequences to clock-like behavior.

On the other hand, as phylogenetic reconstruction assumes
that sampled data are representative of the whole genome
from which they are drawn [34], there is increasing agreement to consider genome-scale analysis more accurate than
single-gene analysis when deciding between conflicting
topologies [19,31]. Conflict derives from the fact that all previous genome-wide phylogenetic attempts to test the hypothesis have failed to confirm the 'moulting group' - the
Ecdysozoa - as a clade. All phylogenomic analyses carried out
to date favor the Coelomata hypothesis with the highest statistical support [12-16]. Furthermore, the Coelomata tree has
shown to be robust to criticism deriving from LBAE [12,14-16]
and nematode species inclusion [14]. Those that consider the
Coelomata hypothesis to be more appropriate insist that
longer sequences, rather than extensive taxon sampling [35],
will more effectively improve the accuracy of phylogenetic
inference [14,15,36,37], and emphasize that an inevitable
trade-off exists between the number of characters and the
number of species used in the study [15].

There are many reasons why the Coelomata-Ecdysozoa problem should be considered the most puzzling problem in animal systematics and a major open-ended subject in
evolutionary biology. The monophyly of the Ecdysozoa group,
strongly championed by the evo-devo community [30], was
originally deduced, and continually recovered, through the
analysis of different single-gene sequences [3,5,6,8-11],
sometimes in combination with morphological characters [7].
There is need for caution, however, as previous studies had
shown that individual genes are not sufficient to estimate the
correct genome phylogeny [19,31]. Furthermore, the reliability of some of the phylogenetic markers used to derive Ecdysozoa has been seriously questioned [32,33]. Those that
consider the Ecdysozoa hypothesis as more plausible insist
that the Coelomata topology is an artifact of LBAE, derived
from the fact that nematode genomes, particularly that of C.
elegans, evolve at higher rates [3], and are consequently displaced to a more basal position.

Acceptance of the new animal phylogeny and the Ecdysozoa

Cambrian explosion [38,39] and the origin of metazoan body
plans [9,30] and consequently would set a new phylogenetic
framework for comparative genomics [40]. We have shown
how phylogenetic reconstruction based on whole-genome

As discussed in our previous paper [16], by including or
excluding certain human homologous exon sequences, we
reduced the problem of LBAE and added a probable bias
favoring Coelomata. The present work confirms that this bias
exists. The concatenation and the posterior phylogenetic
analysis of the sequences shared by the eukaryotes used in
this analysis provide a viable solution to the ancestordescendant relationships of animal species once the LBAE is
removed.

Removing fast-evolving sequences
Removing fast-evolving sequences. Exon sequences of C. elegans showing
LCe ≥ L− = 4.06 represent 15% of the total exon. When these faster
Ce
exons were removed (above blue line), support for the Coelomata
topology was reduced from the original 100% to 85%. Furthermore, when
28% of the faster exons were deleted (red line), Ecdysozoa is recovered
with 90% statistical support. This suggests that LBAE is the main problem

amino-acid sequence ≥ 95% and ≥ 90% respectively, were
retained to find homologous sequences in the other eukaryotic species (threshold values based on a previous human paralogous study [54]). We used tblastn [52] that searches a
query amino-acid sequence on the six translation frames of
the target sequence to search for homology in the complete
genome databases of the species mentioned above. Exons less
than 22 amino acids were removed from the analysis. Each
best hit of tblastn was filtered by means of a threshold e-value
(≤ 1e-03) and a threshold proportion of the query over the
subject sequence length (≥ 75%). Only those exons that pass
through all the species filter conditions were selected as the
final dataset of human exon homologous sequences. All the
exon homologous sequences were aligned using Clustal W
[55] with default parameters. The total number of homologous sequences, derived from 18 human chromosomes, corresponds to 1,192 exons selected from 610 known genes,
adding up to more than 55,500 amino-acid characters.
To arrange homologous sequences in different datasets, pairwise distances between sequences were extracted using the
PROTDIST program (Kimura option) of the PHYLIP package
[56]. Distances between C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H.
sapiens were transformed into branch lengths in a star-like

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R41

unrooted tree (la = (dab + dac - dbc)/2, where la is the length of
the branch leading to a and dab, dac, dbc are the distances
between a and b, a and c, and b and c, respectively). It is
important to emphasize that we are not considering that the
phylogenetic relationships of C. elegans, D. melanogaster
and H. sapiens is a star topology. We used this exact equation
for determining the branch lengths of the three species,
because the unique way to arrange three species in a phylogenetic tree is a star topology. We consider C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens to be members of the ingroup and P.
falciparum, A. thaliana, O. sativa and S. cerevisae as the outgroup species at the moment to root the phylogenetic tree.
Homologous exon sequences were arranged in eight datasets
according to their pertinence to more inclusive areas surrounding the straight line representing identical relative
branch lengths (RBLs) of C. elegans (LCe = lCe/lHs) and D. melanogaster (LDm = lDm/lHs). The Di dataset clusters all the
homologous exon alignments where LDm - δi ≤ LCe ≤ LDm + δi,
where i is an integer ranging from 2 to 7 and δi = 5.0,
3.0,2.5,2.0,15,1.0,0.5. The D1 dataset contains all the exon
homologous sequences without the constraints of evolutionary rates. Exons with negative or undefined normalized distances (lHs = 0) were excluded from the analysis. All the
aligned homologous exon sequences of the Di dataset were
concatenated in the Mi matrix. Three additional matrices
were derived from D1: two by removing exons containing LCe
≥ L− and LCe ≥ L− , and the last one by adjusting the
Ce
Dm
sequences of C. intestinalis, D. melanogaster and C. elegans
to clock-like behavior.

Phylogenetic methods
The relative rate test was performed at the 5% statistical level
by means of the RRTree program [57] using outgroups with
one (S. cerevisae; OUG1) or more species (S. cerevisae, A.
thaliana, O. sativa and P. falciparum; OUG2). In the latter
case, an explicit weighted phylogenetic scheme was chosen
(1/2 S. cerevisae, ((1/8 A. thaliana, 1/8 O. sativa), 1/4 P. falciparum)). Given that three ingroups were set for all analyses
(the chordates H. sapiens, M. musculus, F. rubripes, and C.
intestinalis; the arthropods Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster; and the nematode C. elegans), the
threshold value was corrected for multiple testing to 5/3 =
1.7%. TREE-PUZZLE [58] was used to evaluate six alternative
evolutionary models adjusted for frequencies (+F), site rate
variation (+Γ distribution with two rates) and a proportion of
invariable sites (+I), to estimate the amount of evolutionary
information of datasets by the likelihood-mapping method
[59], to derive the maximum likelihood (ML) trees using the
quartet-puzzling algorithm, to set the ML pairwise sequence
distances, and to test alternative topologies using SH [60]
and ELW [29] tests. The PROML (JTT+f) program of the
PHYLIP package [56] was used to estimate ML trees derived
from the stepwise addition algorithm. Distance methods of
phylogenetic reconstruction were performed using PROT-
