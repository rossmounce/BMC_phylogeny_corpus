An insight into the sialome of Simulium guianense
(DIPTERA:SIMulIIDAE), the main vector of River
Blindness Disease in Brazil

Abstract
Background: Little is known about the composition and function of the saliva in black flies such as Simulium
guianense, the main vector of river blindness disease in Brazil. The complex salivary potion of hematophagous
arthropods counteracts their host’s hemostasis, inflammation, and immunity.
Results: Transcriptome analysis revealed ubiquitous salivary protein families–such as the Antigen-5, Yellow, Kunitz
domain, and serine proteases–in the S. guianense sialotranscriptome. Insect-specific families were also found. About
63.4% of all secreted products revealed protein families found only in Simulium. Additionally, we found a novel
peptide similar to kunitoxin with a structure distantly related to serine protease inhibitors. This study revealed a
relative increase of transcripts of the SVEP protein family when compared with Simulium vittatum and S.
nigrimanum sialotranscriptomes. We were able to extract coding sequences from 164 proteins associated with
blood and sugar feeding, the majority of which were confirmed by proteome analysis.
Conclusions: Our results contribute to understanding the role of Simulium saliva in transmission of Onchocerca
volvulus and evolution of salivary proteins in black flies. It also consists of a platform for mining novel antihemostatic compounds, vaccine candidates against filariasis, and immuno-epidemiologic markers of vector
exposure.

Background
Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a disease caused by
Onchocerca volvulus, a filarial worm transmitted by the
bite of black flies. Onchocerciasis ranks fourth among
the causes of blindness and visual impairment in developing countries [1]. InBrazil, about 1.8% of the population needs treatment, all of whom reside in a vast single
focus (Amazonas-Roraima focus), bordering Venezuela
[2].
Simulium guianense appears to be the main vector in
this focus [3,4], but its biology is not well studied. Saliva
of hematophagous arthropods contains a vast array of
pharmacologically active compounds that act as anticlotting, antiplatelet, vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and
immunomodulatory compounds. Some functional and

biochemical characterizations have been previously
obtained with salivary gland homogenates (SGHs) of
Simulium vittatum, such as anti-fXa [5,6], antithrombin
[7], apyrase [8], hyaluronidase [9], vasodilators [10] and
immunomodulators [11-13].
Recently, sialotranscriptomes (from the Greek Sialo =
saliva) of Nearctic and Neotropical black flies have
revealed transcripts related to the functions previously
described [14,15]. Analysis of salivary transcriptomes of
bloodfeeding arthropods–including different genera of
mosquitoes [16-26], sand flies [27-31], biting midges
[32-34], black flies [14,15], ticks [35-45], bed bugs [46],
triatomines [47-50], tse tse flies [51] and fleas [52]–have
found a great diversity of protein families in different
arthropods and suggested a fast evolution of several of
these salivary protein families, possibly resulting from
their host’s immune pressure. Thus, because of this
great diversity, many salivary proteins do not show
sequence similarities to other known proteins. This also
reflects the independent evolution of blood feeding

within insects, which occurred approximately 30 times
within this group [53].
Evidence suggests that the infraorder Culicomorpha
originated from a single bloodfeeding ancestor during
the Triassic, over 200 million years ago (MYA), with
some families having lost this lifestyle [53]. Black flies
appear as more basal of the Culicomorpha with regard
to the medical importance in this clade. In contrast, the
infraorder Psychodomorpha, which includes sand flies,
probably had a very early origin and isolated phylogenetic position [53]. Data suggest that, alternatively, the
blood feeding behavior could have evolved independently in each family of the Nematocera [54-56].
The Simuliidae family contains 2,025 named species,
12 of which are fossil, and is widely distributed to all
biogeographic regions [57]. Their meal source is based
on warm-blooded animals including man, cattle, and
birds, but also reptiles [58]. In this work, we compare
the sialotranscriptome of female S. guianense with those
of other black flies available in the non-redundant (NR)
protein database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, National Library of Medicine,
NIH) database: Simulium vittatum (Neartic, autogenous,
and zoophilic) and Simulium nigrimanum (Neotropical,
anautogenous, and anthropophilic, but also zoophilic).
We present the analysis of a set 1,722 cDNA
sequences out of 1,974 that yielded good sequence quality, 74.7% of which were associated with secreted products. We describe 174 coding sequences–mostly full
length–the majority of which were confirmed by tryptic
digestion/mass spectrometry (MS). Most salivary proteins found have no known function. Our results should
help to understand the molecular evolution of black flies
to blood feeding, characterize the role of some protein
families associated with sugar feeding, and contribute to
our understanding of the role of the Simulium saliva in
the transmission of O. volvulus. It also consists of a platform for mining novel antihemostatic compounds and
vaccine candidates against filariasis.

ontology database (GO) [60], the CDD of the NCBI [61]
and a custom-prepared subset of the NCBI nucleotide
database containing either mitochondrial or rRNA
sequences.
As indicated in our previous work [14,15], “because
the libraries used are unidirectional, three-frame translations of the dataset were also derived, and open reading
frames starting with a methionine and longer than 40AA residues were submitted to the SignalP server [62]
to help identify putatively secreted (S) proteins. The
EST assembly, BLAST, and signal peptide results were
loaded into an Excel spreadsheet for manual annotation
and are provided in additional File 1.”
Four categories of expressed genes derived from the
manual annotation of the contigs were created (Table 1
and Figure 1). The S category contained 56.9% of the
clusters and 74.7% of the sequences, with an average of
3.1 sequences per cluster. This value is 46% larger (∑c2
= 44.2; p = 2.9E-11) than that seen in S. vittatum, where
only 51% of ESTs encode S proteins, and 21.4% larger
than in S. nigrimanum (∑c2 = 14.4; p = 0.00014).
The housekeeping (H) category had 22.9% and 16.2%
of the clusters and sequences, respectively, and an average of 1.7 sequences per cluster. One singleton was classified as a transposable element (TE), constituting less
than 0.1% of the ESTs or contigs. TEs are a common
finding in hematophagous sialotranscriptomes and most
probably reflect regulatory transcripts repressing transposition rather than active transposition [63]. Transcripts with matches to TE were also found in S.
nigrimanum sialotranscriptome [15]. Finally, 20.1% of
the clusters, containing 9.0% of all sequences, were classified as unknown (U), because no functional assignment could be made. This category had an average of
1.1 sequences per cluster, and most of these consisted
of singletons. A good proportion of these transcripts
could derive from 3’or 5’ untranslated regions of genes
of the previous two categories, as was indicated for a
sialotranscriptome of Anopheles gambiae [64].

Results and discussion
cDNA Library Characteristics

A total of 1,772 clones out of 1,974 that were sequenced
yielded good quality sequences and were used to assemble a database that yielded 752 clusters of related
sequences, 491 of which contained only one EST. The
consensus sequence of each cluster is named either a
contig (deriving from two or more sequences) or a singleton (deriving from a single sequence). As indicated
before [14,15], this paper uses “cluster” or “contig” to
denote sequences derived from both consensus
sequences and singletons. The 752 clusters were compared using the program blastx, blastn, or rpsblast [59]
to the NR protein database of the NCBI, a gene

S Class of Expressed Genes

Inspection of Additional File 1 indicates 1,324 ESTs associated to secreted products that were characterized to several families, including ubiquitous proteins families such
as Antigen-5, Kunitz domain-containing polypeptides,
trypsin, amylase/maltase, apyrase, hyaluronidase, and lysozyme. Insect-specific families, such as Aegyptin and D7/
OBP superfamily, were also found. About 63.6% of all
secreted products revealed exclusively Simulium-specific
families, where the SVEP family contained 22.5% of the
sequences. Others Simulium-specific families were found
such as collagen-like peptide, poly-Q mucin, and glycine
histidine-rich. Some of these families (Table 2) were found
in previous transcriptomes from black flies [14,15]. Novel
putative families were deorphanized in S. nigrimanum.

guianense also revealed an increase of 34.5% and 19.6%
more ESTs than the species described above, respectively, which was statistically significant only in reference
to S. nigrimanum (∑c2 = 18.4; p = 1.77E-05). They are
named “unknown conserved” in Additional File 1. These

Cluster

The 172 clusters (comprising 288 ESTs) attributed to H
genes expressed in the salivary glands of S. guianense
were further divided into 15 subgroups according to
function (Table 3). Not surprisingly for an organ specializing in the secretion of polypeptides, the two larger sets
within the H category were associated with protein synthesis machinery (71 clusters containing 113 ESTs; 39.2%)
and energy metabolism (28 clusters containing 33 ESTs;
11.4%). This pattern was also observed in other sialotranscriptomes of hematophagous insects [22,65].
Exceptionally, the protein synthesis class revealed a
significant increase of 38% more ESTs in S. guianense
compared with S. vittatum (∑c2 = 18.9; p = 1.35E-05).
This increase was also observed in relation to S. nigrimanum (15.3%), but it was not significant statistically
(∑c2 = 0.76; p = 0.38).
We have arbitrarily included a group of 93 ESTs
(32.3%) with 28 clusters in the H category that represent
highly conserved proteins of unknown function, presumably associated with cellular function. Previously, sialomes of S. vittatum and S. nigrimanum described 24%
and 27% of ESTs to this category, respectively. Here, S.

hypothetical” proteins as previously reviewed by Galperin
and Koonin [66]. The complete list of all 288 gene clusters, along with further information about each, is given
in Table 3 and Additional File 1.
Analysis of the S. guianense Sialome

Several clusters of sequences coding for H and S polypeptides indicated in Additional File 1 are abundant and
complete enough to extract novel consensus sequences.
A total of 174 novel sequences–164 of which code for S
proteins– are grouped together in Additional File 2.
With this database, we characterized the proteome via
analysis of SDS-PAGE separated proteins that were tryptic digested and submitted to MS/MS analysis (Figure
2). The results of this experiment are integrated within
the description of the deduced proteins from the transcriptome analysis. Here, we used proteome analysis to
confirm 28 of the 32 protein families found in this sialotranscriptome (Additional File 2), which are described in
more detail below. The reader is here informed that the
introduction of the diverse protein families may contain
text previously used in our publications on Simulium
sialomes [14,15] and such text will appear in “quotes”.
Functional Classification of S Families from S. guianense
Ubiquitous families or domains
Enzymes

Several transcripts found in the sialotranscriptome S.
guianense encode proteins with sequence similarity to
several secreted enzymes such as glycosidase, serine

proteases, hyaluronidases, apyrase, adenosine deaminase
(ADA), and destabilase. They can be associated with
blood feeding, sugar feeding, or both, as follows:
Glycosidases “Amylases and maltases are ubiquitous
enzymes that help digestion of carbohydrates and are
commonly found in sialotrancriptomes from Nematocera including mosquitoes, biting midges, sand flies, and
black flies [67]. These enzymes can be recognized by the
KOG motif 0471, named Alpha-amylase.” The proteome
of the mosquito An. gambiae has 17 members of this
family, one of which (AGAP002102) is expressed in the
SGs [64]. The proteome of Ae. aegypti contains 24 such
enzymes, at least two of which are expressed in their
SGs [25] while Culex quinquefasciatus has 35 such
enzymes, with two also expressed in their SGs [68].
Additional File 2 presents two truncated gene products
coding for glycosidases (Sg-214 and Sg-296). Glycosidases of S. guianense have 79% sequence identity to
other described black fly enzymes (blastp comparisons
can be seen in Additional File 2). Phylogenetic analysis
of the S. guianense protein sequences together with
their closest BLAST matches against the NR database
indicates that the two S. guianense proteins group into
different clades with strong bootstrap support (Figure
3). Sg-296 groups to other Simulium enzymes, to a salivary sand fly enzyme, and to drosophilids, as indicated
by clade I (Figure 3). Sg-214, on the other hand, groups
with a second set of Simulium enzymes and, with 76%
bootstrap support, to Culicine mosquitoes and salivary
biting midge enzymes,[34,69] as shown by clade II (Figure 3). Notice that the mosquitoes, black flies, and Culicoides sequences each group within subclades having
strong bootstrap support, as expected. A third clade of
mosquito-only enzymes (including anophelines and culicines) is also obtained, which merges without strong
bootstrap support to Clade II. Interestingly, the mosquito enzymes in both clades II and III have all been
previously described in salivary transcriptomes, suggesting a common origin of these sugar-hydrolyzing
enzymes in the ancestral fly originating mosquitoes,
black flies, and biting midges. These results indicate that
the two S. guianense sequences appear to be a product
of ancient gene duplication, Sg-296 from Clade I being
the most ancient, as it groups with enzymes of Brachycera, while the two salivary gene products from Culicine
mosquitoes appear to derive from a gene duplication
after the split of the Culicidae. The sequences of the glycosidases Sg-214 and Sg-296 found in the sialotranscriptome of S. guianense were confirmed by proteome
analysis within the fractions 16 and 17, respectively, just
above the 49-kDa standard (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Serine proteases “Serine proteases are commonly found
within hematophagous insect sialomes [70] except in
sand flies, where it was only found in the Phlebotomus

ariasi sialome [30]. This family has an important role in
the immune system, acting as prophenoloxidase activators or in digesting skin matrix components such as in
an elastase function, or hydrolyzing host blood-clotting
components such as fibrinogen/fibrin, or activating plasminogen [71,72]. In Ae. aegypti, transcripts coding for

Page 5 of 25

serine protease with the CUB domain were reported,
indicating specialized substrate recognition [73].” The
sialotrancriptome of S. guianense allowed the identification of transcripts coding for three secreted serine proteases varying with predicted mol wt between 25.4 and
27 kDa, which may derive from three polymorphic
genes. Alignment of representative members of these
three gene products from S. guianense (Sg-416, Sg-138,
and Sg-244) with their best BLAST matches (only Diptera sequences were included) produces a phylogram
indicative of one clade that is related to mosquito and
fruit fly sequences with strong bootstrap support (Figure
4) and one additional Simulium-specific clade, the latter
containing two sub clades. This Simulium-specific clade
is quite divergent, having only 27% or less identity to
their best Diptera match, indicating fast evolution of
this clade. The sub-clades (marked as Simulium I, II,
and III in Figure 4) each contain one enzyme from each
of the Simulidae thus far analyzed for their sialotranscriptome, indicating conservation of these threee salivary expressed genes in black flies. An additional S.
nigrimanum sequence is also found in this Simuliumspecific clade, indicating that a fourth gene may be
expressed in this fly. The serine protease proteins found
in the sialotranscriptome of S. guianense were confirmed
by proteome analysis within the fractions F24 and F25,
located near the 28-kDa marker, consistent with its predicted (25 to 27 kDa) mature weight of these proteins
(Figure 2 and Table 4).
Hyaluronidases Hyaluronidases are enzymes that cleave
hyaluronic acid, which is a main component of the
extracellular matrix in vertebrates. This enzyme was
first described in saliva of New World Lutzomyia longipalpis [74] and thereafter in the SGs of several other
Old and New sand fly species [75,76]. It was also
reported in S. vittatum [77]. Hyaluronidases also have
been described in the sialotranscriptome of C. quinquesfaciatus [68] and Glossina morsitans morsitans [51].
Interestingly, although Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus dubosqui SGHs displayed hyaluronidase activity, no such transcripts were found in their cDNA
libraries [75]. Hyaluronidase transcripts were also absent
from S. vittatum and S. nigrimanum sialotranscripomes
[14,15]. Here, we found one full-length sequence (with
five ESTs) coding for a protein with 37.8 mol wt and pI
9.2 matching the pfam01630 domain named “Glyco_hydro_56, Hyaluronidase” with an e value of 1e-61. The NR
database of the NCBI revealed identities above 43% to
hyaluronidases from Lu. longipalpis and Phlebotomus
arabicus in addition to matching other insect enzymes
from Pediculus humanus and some vespids; however,
these non-dipteran sequences were only 34% identical at
the AA sequence level. Fourteen tryptic peptides
obtained by MS/MS had matches to hyaluronidase

protein within fraction 20, just above the 38-kDa standard and consistent with the predicted 37-kDa mature
mol wt of this protein (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Apyrase “This enzyme hydrolyzes ATP and ADP to
AMP and orthophosphates and has been commonly
found in blood feeding arthropods, where it has been
suggested as a typical case of convergent evolution [67].
Because ADP and ATP are important activators of platelet and neutrophils, apyrase activity removes these
agonists of hemostasis and inflammation [78]. Different
genes have been described for this activity such as members of the 5’-nucleotidase family in mosquitoes and
triatomines [79-82], the Cimex-type apyrase family in
bed bugs and sand flies [83,84] and the type CD-39 protein family in fleas [52]. Expression of this enzyme in
mosquitoes has helped to understand the feeding preference in Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex genus [85]. As
Culex has birds as the primary source of blood and does
not face the platelet barrier, members of this genus
reveal little or absent expression of this enzyme [72].” In
black flies, this enzyme activity was previously described
in SGHs from several species with different degrees of
anthropophy or zoophilic, gonotrophic cycle and vector
or non-vector status, revealing dependence on Ca+2 or
Mg+2 ions for activation and with positive association to
species with confirmed vector status for O. volvulus
[8,86]. While we do not know the origin of black fly
salivary apyrases, transcripts coding for members of the

5’-nucleotidase family have been previously described in
S. vitattum and S. nigrimanum [14,15]. Studies in black
fly sialotrancriptomes also revealed an increase in the
expression of putative apyrase transcripts in S. nigrimanum when compared with S. vittatum, with statistically
significant difference (p = 0.00337) [15]. The 5’-nucleotidases are ubiquitous enzymes usually found bound to
the extracellular face of biologic membranes through a
glycophosphatidyl-inositol phosphate anchor [87,88].
However, salivary secreted enzymes of mosquitoes [80]
and triatomine bugs [81] lack the carboxyterminal
domain where the glycolypid is anchored, allowing their
secretion. Here, we found 14 transcripts coding for the
putative salivary apyrase of S. guianense (Additional File
1). Alignment of the putative apyrase of S. guianense
with their simulid homologs plus vertebrate sequences
known to be membrane anchored reveals the lack of the
carboxyterminal site for the glycolipid anchor in S. guianense (Figure 5), as was also found for other Simulium
putative apyrases [14,15], indicating the S. guianense
enzyme to be secreted. Fifty-eight tryptic peptides were
deducted by MS/MS with matches to apyrase protein
(Sg-354) originated from fraction 16, located just below
the 62-kDa standard (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) ADA transcripts,
although previously found in sialotranscriptome of mosquitoes and sand flies,[16,26,29,73,74,89,90] here appear
for the first time in black fly sialotranscriptomes. Ae.

aegypti salivary homogenates hydrolyze adenosine (Ado)
to inosine, and then to hypoxantine plus ribose, with
enzymatic activities in saliva and SGHs [91,92]. Recombinant ADA from P. dubosqi was shown to have potent
activity [93]. Here, we found a singleton EST producing
one truncated sequence with 68% identity with Ae.
aegypti ADA. Puzzlingly, Ado is a powerful antiplatelet
and vasodilator, and the presence of a salivary ADA
should be considered non-adaptative; however, Ado is
also a potent inducer of mast cell degranulation, and for
this reason it may be in the insect’s interest to remove
this product. Interestingly, P. papatasi does not codify

transcripts to ADA but contains Ado and AMP in its
saliva, which acts as the main salivary vasodilator [94].
Destabilase “This enzyme is an endo-ε-(g-Glu)-Lys isopeptidase, which cleaves isopeptide bonds formed by transglutaminase (Factor XIIIa) between Gln glutamine gcarboxamide and ε-amino groups of lysine and was first
described in the saliva of leeches. Its activity leads to dissolution of stabilized fibrin [67]. Destabilases are members of
the lysozyme superfamily of proteins [95,96].” A 3’ truncated singleton EST is 86% identical to S. nigrimanum
destabilase (Additional File 1). It is still unknown whether
salivary homogenates of black flies have destabilase activity.

guianense proteins and their best matches from the non-redundant protein database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. S.
guianense proteins are indicated by a square and start with Sg-. Serine proteases from Simulium nigrimanum (SIMNIG) are indicated by a circle
and in Simulium vittatum (SIMVIT) by a triangle, with their respective accession numbers. The numbers on the tree bifurcations indicate the
percentage bootstrap support above 75%. The bar at the bottom represents 20% amino acid substitution. Protein sequences were aligned by
the Clustal program, and the dendogram was made with the Mega package after 10 000 bootstraps with the neighbor-joining algorithm. For
other details, see Figure 3.

Protease inhibitor domains

Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) Serpins were previously reported in sialomes of Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ochlerotatus triseriatus and Lu. longipalpis. The
gene coding for the protein gi|3411116 in Ae. aegypti
represents the main salivary anticlotting protein in this
mosquito with specificity to fXa [97,98], having as
homologue the protein gi|56417456 in Ae. albopictus.
Targets of others serpins found in mosquito sialotranscriptomes are unknown [16]. Here, we found one singleton EST (Sg-500) coding for a 3’ truncated serpin
with 60% identity to a homologous serine protease inhibitor from Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae. Serpins have
not been found in black fly sialotranscriptomes, possibly

because these flies use Kunitz-domain proteins as anticlotting agents.
Kunitz-domain protease inhibitors “Kunitz domaincontaining proteins are associated with protease inhibitors and so far have been found in sialotranscriptomes of
Nematocera black flies and biting midges but not in mosquitoes, sand flies, or bloodsucking Hemiptera. Kunitz
domain-containing proteins, however, are abundant in
tick sialotranscriptomes.” Hematophagous arthropods
secrete protease inhibitors that can act in specific points
of the coagulation cascade, mainly against thrombin or
factor Xa (or both). This activity has been previously
described in SGHs of several black fly species such as
S. vittatum, S. ochraceum, S. argus, and S. metallicum

[5-7,99] and Culicoides midges [100]. The sialotranscriptome of S. guianense contains a typical single Kunitz protein deducted from three ESTs (Sg-395). This protein has
its best blastp match to its homologous S. nigrimanum
(72% of identity) and S. vittatum (58%) proteins. Previously, S. vittatum salivary homogenates were shown to
have potent fXa inhibitory activity, but its molecular nature remains unknown [5]. Salivary homogenates of S.
guianense also inhibited the same target of the coagulation cascade (data not published). It is possible that the
fXa inhibitor of Simulium resides in a Kunitz domaincontaining protein. Two tryptic peptides obtained by MS/
MS matching Kunitz-domain protein (Sg-395) were
found within fraction 30, located just below the 6-kDa
standard (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Ubiquitous protein families

Immunity-related products In this group, we found full
coding sequences to two ubiquitous antimicrobial peptides: lysozyme and cepropin. These families are commonly found in hematophagous arthropods, and their
presence was previously reported in black fly sialotrancriptomes [14,15].
The S. guianense sialotranscriptome revealed 25 ESTs
coding for members of the lysozyme family (Additional
File 1), where several possible alleles of the same gene
were identified. S. guianense salivary lysozyme is 79%
identical to S. nigrimanum salivary lysozyme and 52%
identical to its closest mosquito relative (Additional File
2). Lysozyme activity in S. guianense was confirmed to
exist in SGHs (unpublished, Chagas). This activity was
described in both male and female mosquitoes
[101,102]. Seven tryptic peptides deducted by MS/MS
had matches to lysozyme protein (Sg-263) within fraction 30, located just below the 6-kDa standard (Figure 2
and Table 4).
Cecropins are small secreted basic proteins of 3 kDa
mol wt, rich in aliphatic AAs, mainly Val, with highest
conservation in its carboxy terminal region. Ten ESTs
from the S. guianense sialotranscriptome code for two
closely related, possibly allelic, cecropins. These cecropins, as expected, have their best matches to other
Simulium and mosquito cecropins. The cecropin peptides (Sg-368 and Sg-369) found in the sialotranscriptome of S. guianense were confirmed by proteome
analysis within the fraction 31, located just above the 3kDa marker, consistent with the predicted 3-kDa mature
mol wt of this protein (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Antigen-5 family “This ubiquitous family belongs to
the wider CAP superfamily [103]. Most members have
no known function, but a few have been related to
pathogen defenses in plants, as toxins in snake and
lizard venoms [104,105], as a platelet aggregation inhibitor in a tabanid fly [106], and as a possible inhibitor of
the classical pathway of complement activation in the

Page 9 of 25

stable fly [107,108].” Members of this family are found
in all nematoceram sialotranscriptomes [67]. The annotated An. gambiae proteome reveals 21 proteins for this
family, 2 of which are expressed in the SGs [64]. Similarly, the Ae. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus proteome
have over 30 members of the family, of which at least 2
are expressed in their SGs [25,68]. The S. guianense sialotranscriptome reveals two clusters coding for CAP
family members. The phylogram resulting of the alignment of the two S. guianense proteins with their 25 best
blastp matches from the NR protein database (excluding
drosophilid proteins) reveals one clade of bloodsucking
Nematocera with relatively strong bootstrap support
(70%), and strong bootstrap support for the sub-clades
containing each of the four families. Interestingly, all
members of this clade (marked as “Salivary” in Figure 6)
were found in sialotrancriptomes, suggesting a common
salivary ancestor for this particular CAP-coding gene
within Nematocera. The S. guianense protein Sg-453 is
outside this clade and may represent an additional
Simulium gene member of the CAP family that has
been recruited for a salivary function. Thirty tryptic peptides deducted by MS/MS had matches for an Antigen-5
protein (Sg-457) within fraction 24, located just above
the 28-kDa marked, near the predicted 30-kDa mature
mol wt of this protein (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Yellow family This family is insect-specific in eukaryotes and received this name due to mutation of a gene
that induces a yellow phenotype in Drosophila, resulting
from the disruption of melanin formation. In Nematocera, this family is abundantly expressed in sand flies
and has been suggested as important markers of vector
exposure [109]. S. guianense reveals only one EST to
Yellow protein with a match to Yellow of C. quinquesfaciatus (64% identity). Interestly, S. vittatum also reveals
one transcript to the Yellow family [14]. The function of
this protein in Simulium remains unknown.
ML domain family S. guianense contains one transcript
coding for a protein containing the ML domain, which
was not previously reported in black fly sialomes. This
domain is implicated in lipid recognition, particularly in
the recognition of pathogen-related products, but could
also have a lysosomal function [110] and thus have a
housekeeping function. It has an immunoglobulin-like
b-sandwich fold similar to that of E-set. The blast to NR
database suggests similarity to Niemann-Pick Type C-2
putative from An. aegypti (also known as Epipidymal
secretory protein E1) and similarities to MPA2 allergen
from Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera). The function
of this protein in S. guianense remains unknown.
Lipocalins Lipocalins are proteins widely distributed in
animals and plants. This protein family is highly
expressed in triatomines, such as Rhodnius prolixus,
Triatoma infestans [47], Triatoma brasiliensis [111] and

Chagas et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:612
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/612

Dipetalogaster maxima [112]. In triatomines, lipocalins
are reported as carriers of nitric oxide, kratagonists (binders of agonists) of biogenic amines, Ado nucleotides,
and thromboxane A2, as well as inhibitors of collageninduced platelet aggregation and thrombin and as allergens [70,113-116]. We found two ESTs coding for different lipocalins (Sg-671 and Sg-568). The deducted AA
sequence of both transcripts matches human apolipoprotein in the Swissprot database. If secreted in saliva,
these proteins are candidates for agonist lipid binding.
Insect-specific families

Aegyptin family This protein family, commonly found
in sialotranscriptomes of mosquitoes, was first named as
30-kDa Aedes allergen [117] and as GE-rich protein
[89]. It has revealed high levels of expression in the sialotranscriptome of Anopheles funestus [18]. Functional
analyses of an Ae. aegypti family member, named
Aegyptin, as well as a member from An. stephensi, have
demonstrated its function as an antagonist of collageninduced platelet aggregation and as a useful tool for
inhibiting platelet-collagen interaction in vitro and in
vivo [18,72,118]. Previous black fly sialotranscriptomes
have revealed proteins similar to Aegyptin, supporting
the common origin of hematophagy in mosquitoes and

Page 10 of 25

black flies as proposed by Grimaldi and Engel [53].
Here, we found 23 ESTs of the S class (Additional File
1) coding for what appear to be alleles of a single gene
similar to Aegyptin-like proteins, showing 60% identity
to Aegyptins from sialotranscriptomes of black flies and
35% to mosquito homologs. The alignment revealed
GE-rich regions mainly in the middle of the sequences
(not shown). Thirty-seven tryptic peptides obtained by
MS/MS had matches to Aegyptin protein (Sg-276)
within fraction 24, located just above the 28-kDa marker, consistent with predicted (28 kDa) mature weight
of this protein (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Diptera Secreted Protein from Conserved Insect
Family Five proteins found in sialotranscriptome of S.
guianense were similar to secreted protein from insects.
This family was previously described in S. nigrimanum
sialotranscriptome. They vary between 37 and 57 kDa
mol wt with pI 6.1 to 9.6. The best matches to the NR
database showed similarities to several families of Diptera (Culicidae, Ceratopogonidae, Drosophilidae) and
Hymenoptera (Pteromalidae and Formicidae) maintaining a low degree of conserved AA. The phylogram suggests at least four different genes to exist in S.
guianense. Pattern-initiated PSI-BLAST (PHI-BLAST)

aligned by the Clustal program, and the dendogram was made with the Mega package after 10 000 bootstraps with the neighbor-joining
algorithm. For other details, see Figure 3.

the diversity of this protein family within insects (Additional File 3).
Laminin-like Secreted Salivary Protein Found in
Simulium and Culicoides Laminin-like proteins have
been suggested to be extracellular matrix proteins [34].
The S. guianense sialotranscriptome revealed one truncated protein (Sg-431) with four ESTs coding to a S. vittatum homolog (76% identity) and to a Culicoides
nubeculosus protein with 32% identity. Two tryptic peptides obtained by MS/MS had matches for laminin-like
protein within fraction 14, just above the 62-kDa standard (Figure 2 and Table 4).
D7/OBP superfamily “The odorant-binding protein
family is ubiquitous in insects. The D7 protein family,
specific to bloodsucking Nematocera, is recognized as a
member of the OBP superfamily [119,120] but it contains two additional a-helices [121,122]. Short and long
forms of the D7 family exist in which one or two D7
domains exist in the same protein, producing proteins
with mature mol wt of ~18 or ~28 kDa. In Simulium,
an extra-short family with ~12 kDa is also found, reminiscent of sand fly salivary proteins, which also have an
ultra-short form but bear no similarities to the black fly
proteins at the AA level [67]. “The S. guianense OBP/D7
sequences were grouped in the three subfamilies
described below.
Long D7 family: Two proteins with two OBP domains
are recognized in the S. guianense sialotranscriptome.
When searched against the NR database using blastp,
these proteins only produce significant matches to other
Simulium proteins, but all three produce two matches
each to the PFAM PBP_GOBP domain when using the
tool rpsblast, one in the first half and the other in the
second half of the protein. A third truncated protein has
only one OBP domain but matches long D7 proteins of
S. nigrimanum. Long D7 proteins had tryptic peptides
deducted by MS/MS within fractions F23 and F26 near
the 28-kDa standard, consistent with the predicted (28
kDa and 24 kDa) mature weight of these proteins (Figure 2 and Table 4).
D7 16-kDa family: Two S. guianense proteins containing one OBP domain were found. Sg-331 produces significant similarities only to other Simulium proteins, but
Sg-350 additionally retrieves OBP from C. quinquefasciatus. Tryptic peptides were deducted by MS/MS
matches to D7 16-kDa proteins within the fractions 29
and 30, just above the 6-kDa marker (Figure 2 and
Table 4).
Ultra-short D7 proteins (10-12 kDa mature weight):
This was the most expressed family within the D7/OBP
superfamily, encompassing 80 ESTs (Additional File 1).

Page 11 of 25

All clusters contain signal peptide, suggesting secreted
proteins. These data suggest the existence of at least
four genes coding for ultra-short D7 proteins (Sg-75,
Sg-190, Sg-363, and Sg-383) and several possible alleles.
Only Sg-383 was deducted by MS/MS within fraction
31, just below the 6-kDa marker (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Simulium-specific families

Of the 1,324 ESTs of the S class, 843 ESTs are specific
to Simulium, encompassing 18 specific families. Some
families from S. nigrimanum were deorphanized, and a
new family coding to Kunitoxin-like proteins was first
found in insect sialotranscriptomes. More details of
these families are described below.
SVEP vasodilator family “This family is specific to
black flies and was originally described in SGHs of S.
vittatum, when it was named Simulium vasodilator
erythema protein (SVEP) because it produced a prolonged vasodilation when tested in rabbit skin [10]. A
recombinant protein (rSVEP) was expressed and functionally characterized as a potent vasodilator, possibly
activating ATP-dependent K+ channels [123]. This
property has an important role during blood feeding
and was suggested as one key compound of the competence vector of these flies in the transmission of Onchocerca parasites [124].” Sialotranscriptomes of two black
fly species identified SVEP to belong to a diverse multigene family with at least five genes for each species
[14,15]. The sialotranscriptome of S. guianense also
revealed proteins homologous to SVEP, totaling 190
ESTs with identities to other Simulium SVEPs varying
from 50 to 70%. Alignment of members of this family
showed sequences with similar sizes but with few conserved AAs. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of all
SVEP proteins, after 10 000 bootstraps grouped the
majority of the members of S. vittatum in a specific
clade (I) with 80% bootstrap support (Figure 7). The
phylogram indicates at least three genes and several
either recent gene duplications and/or alleles coding to
members of this family (clade IV on Figure 7). The protein Sg-13 shares clade II, with 92% of bootstrap support, with its homologous S. nigrimanum proteins. ESTs
coding for Sg-13 or very closely related proteins represent more than 50% of the sequences coding for SVEP
members in this sialotranscriptome. Clade III groups
only SVEPs from S. vittatum and S. nigrimanum without bootstrap support. Clade IV reveals a possible case
of gene duplication or expression (or both) of a very
polymorphic gene from S. guianense, and the last clade
(V) groups two clusters (Sg-344 and Sg-343) of S. guianense with its homologous S. nigrimanum (with 100%
bootstrap support), which appear completely distinct
from other SVEP proteins. This scenario indicates that
at least two genes (Sg-13 and Sg-344) have common
ancestors with S. nigrimanum and a third gene could

Chagas et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:612
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/612

have given rise to the increased of expression of this
protein family, shown in clade IV, possibly with many
recent gene duplications. Interestingly, S. guianense has
190 ESTs coding for SVEP (14.4% of the transcripts of
the S class), more than double those of S. nigrimanum
(6.8% of its ESTs from the S class) and more than three
times those of S. vittatum (which codes 4.5% of its ESTs
from the S class to SVEP). These increases are highly
significant, having scores of c2 = 16.72 (p = 2.3E-8) and
c2 = 72.5 (p = 1.6E-17) to S. nigrimanum and S. vittatum, respectively. All sequences of SVEP proteins found
in the sialotranscriptome of S. guianense were confirmed
by proteome analysis within fraction 30, located just
above the 14-kDa marker, consistent with the predicted
(14 kDa) mature weight of SVEP protein (Figure 2 and
Table 4).
H-rich, acid proteins of Simulium This protein family
is known by its repeats of histidine, proline, glutamine,
and glutamic acid residues. The repeat nature of these
proteins had been suggested to interact with matrix proteins–possibly collagen–and function in a manner analogous to mosquito Aegyptins, which inhibit collageninduced platelet aggregation [88]. It is also possible that
the His repeats act as antimicrobials by chelating Zn or
other trace element ions [125-127]. The black fly S. vittatum revealed this family to be the most abundant protein family expressed in its sialotranscriptome, with four
repeat regions in its sequences (arginine-rich, HG
repeat, HPH repeat, and QPE repeat) [14]. Similarly,
mosquito and Culicoides sialotrancriptomes also contain
proteins with Pro-His and Gly-His repeats, but no other
sequence similarities. The S. guianense sialotranscriptome has 9.6% of all its secretory ESTs coding for members of this family, having above 70% identity to their
homologous S. nigrimanum proteins. Alignment (Figure
8) shows that the S. guianense sequences, together with
their homologous S. nigrimanum proteins, contain one
repeat region coding for Pro-Lys-Pro residues, whereas
in S. vittatum, the Lys residue is substituted by Gln.
The phylogram of this protein family (Figure 8), when
added to mosquito and Culicoides sequences, reveals
that all Simulium sequences indicate (as expected) a
common ancestor with 93% bootstrap support, with S.
guianense sharing the same branch with S. nigrimanum
(also as expected).
Mucins “Mucins are low-complexity proteins rich in
serine and threonine residues. They are frequently
found in sialotranscriptomes of bloodsucking arthropods
such as mosquitoes [72,73,128], biting midges [69], bed
bugs [46] and black flies [14,15]. While these proteins’
biologic function is not completely known, they have
been suggested to provide protection to internal parts of
the salivary ducts and also to have antimicrobial functions. They are commonly expressed in moist epithelia,

Page 12 of 25

where they offer protection [129,130] In addition,
mucins are modified post-translationally, and their
mature forms have N-acetyl-galactosamine residues
[130].” Two types of Simulium-specific mucins are
found in the sialotranscriptome of S. guianense, as
follows.
Simulium mucin family Nine proteins (with 40 ESTs)
in the S. guianense sialotranscriptome code for Simulium mucin. Their coding sequences have high amounts
of Ser + Thr residues, varying from 34.6 to 42.6%, and
from 40-144 galactosylation sites are predicted by the
NetOglyc server [131]. Although similar sequences were
found in the sialotranscriptome of S. nigrimanum, members of this family were absent in S. vittatum. Alignment
of the S. guianense and S. nigrimanum sequences reveals
extensive similarities and identities along the whole
sequence, but the phylogram clearly distinguishes S.
guianense and S. nigrimanum specific clades (Figure 9).
The variation among the S. guianense sequences may
result from splice variants, polymerase slippage on
nucleotide repeats, or multiple genes. Several tryptic
peptides were deduced by MS/MS with matches for
Simulium mucin within fraction 16 (just below the 62kDa marker) and to fraction 9 (just above the 96-kDa
marker) (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Acid mucins proteins similar to Basic 7-13 Simulium
family The sialotranscriptome of S. nigrimanum
reported small basic proteins (pI 8.1-10.6) with mature
weight varying from 7 to 13 kDa and above 65% identity
to orphan proteins found in the sialotranscriptome of S.
vittatum [15]. The sialotranscriptome of S. guianense
revealed 13 proteins (with 39 ESTs) with best matches
to members of this family–from both S. vittatum and S.
nigrimanum–at a 50% identity level; however, these
sequences code for acid, not basic, proteins (pI 4.1-4.4)
(Figure 10), with 0 to 19 potential galactosylation sites.
Notably, the S. guianense proteins have an extended
central domain containing Gly-Ser repeats that vary in
size among the proteins, which may reflect polymerase
slippage among closely related genes (Figure 10). The
phylogenetic tree cluster produces monospecific
branches indicative either of single polymorphic genes
or, alternatively, of multiple genes that possibly interact,
producing gene conversions (Figure 10).
Simulium collagen-like family Previous sialotranscriptomes of black flies reported specific proteins named as
Simulium collagen-like that are rich in Pro-Gly residues
[14,15]. Homologs to this family were found in the sialotranscriptome of S. guianense, with 17 clusters containing 48 ESTs (Table 2). These 17 clusters are variations
of only three sequences, which were aligned with their
Simulium homologs (having ~ 40% identity) to produce
the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 11. Alignment
revealed relatively conserved AAs in the length of the

sequence, with some gaps due to the longer sequences
from S. vittatum. The phylogram maintains monospecific clades, as seen before for the mucin families (Figure
11). Several tryptic peptides were deducted by MS/MS
within fraction 23, just above the 28-kDa standard,
above the predicted (22 kDa) mature weight of these
proteins (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Sv 7.8 kDa family Members of this family were first
found in the sialotranscriptome of S. vittatum coding
for proteins with 7.8 kDa mol wt [14]. Later, sialotranscriptome of S. nigrimanum added six more transcripts
to this family, suggesting it to be a divergent multifamily
gene from Simulium [15]. Sequences from S. guianense
maintain 60% identity to its homologous S. nigrimanum
protein and 50% to the S. vittatum protein, coding for

basic proteins (pI 9-10.4) with mature weight varying
from 7.1 to 13.4 kDa. Alignment revealed low levels of
conserved AAs and at least four genes to S. guianense
proteins of this family, marked as clades I-IV on Figure
12. Several tryptic peptides were deducted by MS/MS in
the fractions F27, F30, F32, and F31. These fractions are
located in the gel just above the 14-kDa marker and just
above the 3-kDa marker. These results are consistent
with the predicted (7 to 13 kDa) mature weight of these
proteins (Figure 2 and Table 4).
Basic 7-13 Simulium family The S. guianense sialotranscriptome added two more proteins (Sg-420 and Sg403) with six ESTs to this family coding to basic proteins (pI 11) and 8 kDa, with more than 59% similarities
to their homologous S. nigrimanum and S. vittatum

proteins. Tryptic peptides were found by MS/MS within
fractions 30 and 31, just below the 6-kDa standard (Figure 2 and Table 4). Their function remains unknown.
Simulium 4.8-kDa family Five more transcripts were
added to this family, which appears highly conserved in
sialotranscriptomes of Simulium. Their sequences code
to acidic proteins (pI 4.4) with 5 kDa of mature weight
and are devoid of cysteines. These peptides have
unknown function.
Simulium Basic 7.4-kDa family The cluster Sg-422
(with four ESTs) codes to a basic peptide of 7 kDa mol
wt and above 50% identity to their homologous proteins
from S. vittatum and S. nigrimanum. This protein family
also does not contain any Cys residues on the mature
peptide. Four tryptic peptides originated from Sg-422
were deduced by MS/MS within fraction 31, just below
the 6-kDa standard, consistent with the predicted (6.8

kDa) mature weight of this protein (Figure 2 and Table
4).
Simulium Basic 13-kDa Sg-446 added three more
ESTs to this family, and has ~ 40% identity to other
Simulium proteins. They do not match other known
proteins in any of the NR, GO, KOG, CDD, PFAM, or
SMART databases. Two tryptic peptides were deduced
by MS/MS within fraction 29, just below the 14-kDa
standard and consistent with the predicted (13.7 kDa)
mature weight of this protein (Figure 2 and Table 4).
5-Cys Simulium family This family received this name
because it contains five Cys in their sequences. One protein with nine ESTs is here reported in the S. guianense
sialotranscriptome coding to an acid protein (pI 5.7)
with 14-kDa mol wt and above 60% of identity to homologs found in Simulium sialotranscriptomes. Three tryptic peptides were deduced by MS/MS within fraction

Table 4).
Families deorphanized from S. nigrimanum. Six additional protein families were characterized in common
between S. nigrimanum and S. guianense, and no other
known protein. They do not produce significant matches
to others proteins in the NR database, and have thus
deorphanized these S. nigrimanum proteins.
Deorphanized S. nigrimanum 8-10 Cys W family. This
family is so named because their members contain from
8 to 10 conserved Cys and Trp in their mature
sequences. The sialotranscriptome of S. nigrimanum
revealed two distinct subfamilies, one containing 10 Cys

and 5 conserved Trp and other containing 8 Cys and 6
Trp. This last group was suggested as a candidate protein in the etiology of pemphigus foliaceus due its similarity to proteins annotated as junctional adhesion
molecules [15]. The S. guianense sialotranscriptome
added two more proteins to this family (11 ESTs),
which contain 9 Cys and 5 or 6 Trp. These proteins
were confirmed by MS/MS within fraction 29, just
below the 14-kDa standard, near their predicted (16.9
kDa) mature weights (Figure 2 and Table 4). The function of this protein family remains unknown.
The sialotrancriptome of S. guianense added three
more proteins (Sg-319, Sg-320, and Sg-321) with 12

ESTs to the Acid 28-kDa family. PAGE MS/MS results
reported many tryptic peptides for these proteins within
fraction F23, just above the 28-kDa marker (Figure 2
and Table 4), in accordance with the predicted (22 to 27
kDa) mature mol wt of these proteins. One protein (Sg136) with nine ESTs was added to Simulium Basic 28kDa family. This protein (Sg-136) had several tryptic
peptides deducted by MS/MS within fraction 24, consistent with a mass near 28 kDa (Figure 2 and Table 4).
The protein family named as 19-kDa family, first seen
in S. nigrimanum, was deorphanized with two proteins
(Sg-303 and Sg-309) with 10 ESTs coding for basic proteins of 16.8 MW and signal peptide in their sequences.
Tryptic peptides were found by MS/MS within the fraction 27, located just above the 14-kDa standard and
consistent with the predicted (16.8 kDa) mature weight
of this protein (Figure 2 and Table 4). Other putative

secreted peptides were also deducted from the S. guianense sialotranscriptome, such as the cluster Sg-258 (22
ETS) coding to basic protein of 8-kDa mol wt that has
70% identity to the orphan protein of the S. nigrimanum
sialotranscriptome previously named 8-kDa basic protein
family. Five tryptic peptides were deducted by MS/MS
within fraction 31, just below the 6-kDa marker (Figure
2 and Table 4). The smaller peptide found in this cDNA
library also represents one case of deorphanization with
two ESTs in cluster Sg-438 matching members of the
Sn basic 4.4-kDa family.
Proteins currently unique to S. guianense

Novel peptide similar to kunitoxin The S. guianense
has two clusters (Sg-375 and Sg-409) coding to novel
peptide distantly similar (32% identity) to the snake peptide kunitoxin [132]. They are Cys-rich and were suggested as protease and serine protease inhibitors in

Chagas et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:612
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/612

snake venom glands [133]. Although the snake peptides
have a typical Kunitz domain, this domain is not identified in the black fly protein. Kunitoxin inhibits plasmin
and thrombin, blocks L-type calcium channels, and
forms part of the neurotoxic complexes with PLA 2
molecules [133]. No similar sequences have been found
so far in any previously described sialotranscriptome.
Together, the black fly family grouped eight ESTs coding for this secreted basic peptide with 8-9 kDa. The
PAGE/MS/MS run reported four tryptic peptides for the
Kunitoxin-like protein at fraction 31, coincident with a
well-stained band between 3 and 6-kDa standards (Figure 2 and Table 4).

Conclusions
Sialotranscriptomes of hematophagous insects have
revealed a large number of putative novel proteins, helping to understand the role of saliva in blood feeding,
sugar feeding, and transmission of distinct parasites. In
the last 2 years, two black fly sialotrancriptomes were
described. The sialome of S. guianense represented the
first from a species with confirmed vectorial status for
onchocerciasis. Black flies had their origin ~180 MYA
(Middle Jurassic), based on the fossil record [58], and
currently are among the best studied Diptera, with 2,025
species named, 12 of which are fossil [57]. Their blood
feeding mode has been proposed as a plesiomorphic
character in the Culicomorpha appearing during the
Triassic ~250 MYA and diverging in the Late Jurassic.
Based on tectonic plate movement, we believe that Neotropical black flies share a distant common origin with
Neartic species, because union of the Americas only
occurred during the Cenozoic, after the irradiation of
mammals. Thus, it is probable that this common black
fly ancestor originated before the irradiation and expansion of mammals 60 MYA and probably had birds or
reptiles as their blood source, and this origin has indeed
been maintained in some species; however, others could
have diverged to feeding on mammals, including
humans, conferring a level of plasticity (zoophilic or
anthropophilic behavior) inside the Simulidae family.
For example, S. nigrimanum was found to have both
feeding behaviors in different places. Conversely, S. guianense has a high degree of anthropophily and was incriminated as the main vector of river blindness in the
focus that includes Brazil and Venezuela (Yanomami
Indians) [4]. This plasticity seen in the choice of host
could be accompanied by gene duplications and fast
evolution in several protein families.
Here, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of protein
families found in the sialomes of three black flies from
different subgenera: S. vittatum (Neartic, zoophilic,
autogenous, and non-vector of onchocerciasis), S. nigrimanum (Neotropical, zoophilic and anthropophilic,

Page 18 of 25

anautogenous, and potential vector) and S. guianense
(Neotropical, anthropophilic, anautogenous, and vector
of onchocerciasis). Notice that the last two are more
closely overlapping in their characteristics. It is also
important here to clear the taxonomic status of these
species, mainly because S. nigrimanum shares the same
geographic distribution as S. guianense, except for S.
nigrimanum absence within the Amazon region. Currently, some authors [134] group both species into the
Trichodagmia subgenus of Simulium, while–based on
phylogenetic analysis–others have determined [135] that
S. guianense belong to a different subgenus, Thyrsopelma, and elevated the subgenus to genus (thus Trichodagmia nigrimanum and Thyrsopelma guianense, which
are cited in this work as S. nigrimanum and S. guianense, respectively).
Independent of this taxonomic confusion, it is clear
from the phylogenetic analysis containing the black fly
species that, in the majority of cases, proteins from S.
nigrimanum grouped with strong bootstrap support
with those of S. guianense while excluding from the
same sub clade the S. vittatum homologs, an expected
result from the biogeography of the species. On the
other hand, the number of families that were found
exclusive of Neotropical flies is entirely shared except
for the S. guianense Kunitoxin family, suggesting a relatively recent common ancestor between these South
American flies.
It is important to note the increased expression in S.
guianense of some proteins families such as D7, SVEP,
and other protein families specific to Simulium (which
contain 32% of all transcripts), suggesting it to be associated with the anthropophilic and vectorial status of S.
guianense in the transmission of onchocerciasis. Indeed,
the autogenous S. vittatum has the least expression of
salivary secreted proteins and lacks many of the families
found in the Neotropical flies. S. nigrimanum was
recently suggested as a potential vector of onchocerciasis [136].
From a conservative perspective, we confirmed the
presence of ubiquitous salivary protein families such as
Antigen-5, Yellow, ML domain, lipocalin, lysozyme,
cecropin, serpin, Kunitz domain, serine protease, hyaluronidase, apyrase, glycosidase, ADA, and destabilase
within the Simulium genus; however, four of these protein families (ML domain, serpin, hyaluronidase, and
ADA) were exclusive to the S. guianense sialotranscriptome. Kunitz-domain proteins were seen in all black fly
sialotranscriptomes. Probably this family is responsible
for the anticoagulant activity previously related to SGHs
in S. guianense [137].
Insect-specific protein families such as Aegyptin, D7
family (which include D7 ultra-short, D7 16-kDa, and
long D7), and Diptera secreted protein from conserved

Chagas et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:612

insect family and were found in all black fly sialotranscriptomes. The protein laminin-like was found only in
S. guianense and S. vittatum sialotranscriptomes.
As expected, S. guianense contained several protein
families previously found only in the sialotranscriptomes
of S. nigrimanum and also S. vittatum such as the
SVEP, H-rich acid proteins, acid mucin proteins similar
to basic 7-13 Simulium family, Simulium collagen-like,
Sv 7.8-kDa family, 5-Cys Simulium family, basic 7-13
Simulium family, Simulium 4.8-kDa family, Simulium
basic 7.4-kDa family, and Simulium basic 13-kDa family.
Except for SVEP, a vasodilator, none of these proteins’
function is known. It is possible that some of these
families share the same function. Additionally, the S.
guianense sialotranscriptome revealed protein families
previously found exclusive to S. nigrimanum such as the
Simulium mucin, 28-kDa basic Simulium family, acid
28-kDa family, 19-kDa family, Sn 8-10 Cys W family, 8kDa basic protein, and Sn basic 4.4-kDa family, none of
which have a known function. We also identified proteins currently unique to S. guianense such as a novel
peptide similar to kunitoxin commonly found in venom
of snakes. Transcripts associated with sugar feeding,
such as glycosidases, show a common ancestor in the
Diptera (fruit flies and mosquito); however, immunerelated products such as trypsins appear phylogeneticaly
more expanded relative to dipterous and non-dipterous
insects such as lepidopterans. In mosquitoes, trypsin
activity was suggested as the first line of defense against
microorganisms during feeding [101]. S. guianense also
has this activity confirmed by in-gel protein digestion
assays from SGHs (data not published) and possibly
could conserve the same function in black flies. Finally,
our results contribute to understanding the role of
Simulium saliva in the transmission of O. volvulus and
in the evolution of the salivary proteins in black flies. It
also consists of a platform for mining novel antihemostatic compounds, epidemiologic markers of vector
exposure, and vaccine candidates against filariasis.

Methods
Chemicals

Standard laboratory chemicals were purchased from
Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO) if not specified
otherwise.
Black Flies

Female adult S. guianense were obtained from pupae
collected in waterfalls with aquatic plants of the Podostemaceae family. The breeding sites are located in the
Jauaperi River, Rorainopolis municipality, Roraima state,
Brazil. Identification of the black fly species followed the
standard keys from Shelley et al.[138].

Page 19 of 25

Insects were kept with free access to 10% Karo® honey
diluted solution. SGs from recently emerged and 1- to2-day-old adult female (25 of each age) were dissected
in 150 mM sodium chloride pH 7.4, immediately transferred to 50-μL of RNAlater (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX),
and kept refrigerated until use.
Library Construction

SG RNA, extracted from 75 intact glands, was isolated
using the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Other procedures were as
described before [14,15] and are reproduced here for
easiness of access to the reader: “The PCR-based cDNA
library was made following the instructions for the
SMART (switching mechanism at 5’end of RNA transcript) cDNA library construction kit (Clontech, Palo
Alto, CA). This system uses oligoribonucleotide
(SMART IV) to attach an identical sequence at the 5’
end of each reverse-transcribed cDNA strand. This
sequence is then utilized in subsequent PCR reactions
and restriction digests.
First-strand synthesis was carried out using PowerScript reverse transcriptase at 42°C for 1 h in the presence of the SMART IV and CDS III (3’) primers.
Second-strand synthesis was performed by a long-distance PCR-based protocol using Advantage Taq polymerase (Clontech) mix in the presence of the 5’ PCR
primer and the CDS III (3’) primer. The cDNA synthesis
procedure resulted in creation of SfiI A and B restriction
enzyme sites at the ends of the PCR products that are
used for cloning into the phage vector (l TriplEx2 vector; Clontech). PCR conditions were as follows: 95°C for
1 min; 26 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 68°C for 6 min. A
small portion of the cDNA obtained by PCR was analyzed on an E-Gel® 1.2% with SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) to
check quality and range of cDNA synthesized. Doublestranded cDNA was immediately treated with proteinase
K (0.8 μg/mL) at 45°C for 20 min, and the enzyme was
removed by ultrafiltration though a Microcon YM-100
centrifugal filter device (Amicon Inc., Beverly, CA). The
cleaned, double-stranded cDNA was then digested with
SfiI at 50°C for 2 h, followed by size fractionation on a
ChromaSpin-400 column (Clontech) into small (S),
medium (M), and large (L) transcripts based on their
electrophoresis profile on an E-Gel ® 1.2% with SYBR
Safe. Selected fractions were pooled and concentrated
using a Microcon YM-100.
The concentrated cDNA mixture was ligated into the
l TriplEx2 vector, and the resulting ligation mixture
was packaged using the GigaPack® III Plus packaging
extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The packaged library was plated
by infecting log-phase XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells

(Clontech). The percentage of recombinant clones was
determined by blue-white selection screening on LB/
MgSO 4 plates containing X-gal/IPTG. Recombinants
were also determined by PCR, using vector primers
PT2F1 (AAG TAC TCT AGC AAT TGT GAG C) and
PT2R1 (CTC TTC GCT ATT ACG CCA GCT G)
flanking the inserted cDNA, with subsequent visualization of the products on an E-Gel ® 1.2% with SYBR
Safe.”
cDNA Sequencing

This was done as described before [14,15] and is reproduced here for easiness of access to the reader:“Twenty
96-well plates were prepared for cyclo sequencing, each
containing 94 clones and two DNA controls, as follows:
The cDNA library was plated on LB/MgSO4 plates containing X-gal/IPTG to an average of 250 plaques per
150 mm Petri plate. Recombinant (white) plaques were
randomly selected and transferred to 96-well microtiter
plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) containing 75 μL of ultrapure water (KD Medical, Columbia, MD) per well. The
plates were covered and placed on a gyrating shaker for
30 min at room temperature. The phage suspension was
either immediately used for PCR or stored at 4°C for
future use.
To amplify the cDNA using a PCR reaction, 5 μL of
the phage sample was used as a template. The primers
were sequences from the l TriplEx2 vector and named
PT2F1 (AAG TAC TCT AGC AAT TGT GAG C) and
PT2R1 (CTC TTC GCT ATT ACG CCA GCT G), positioned at the 5’ end and the 3’ end of the cDNA insert,
respectively. The reaction was carried out in a 96-well
PCR microtiter plate (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster
City, CA) using FastStart Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Perkin Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA). The
PCR conditions were 1 hold of 75°C for 3 min; 1 hold
of 94°C for 4 min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 49°C for
1 min; 72°C for 4 min. The amplified products were
analysed on an E-Gel ® 1.2% with SYBR Safe. Clones
were PCR amplified, and those showing a single band
were selected for sequencing. Approximately 200-250 ng
of each PCR product was transferred to a 96-well PCR
microtiter plate (Applied Biosystems) and frozen at -20°
C. Samples were shipped on dry ice to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Genomics Unit (NIAID, NIH, Hamilton, MT) with primer (PT2F3: TCT CGG GAA GCG
CGC CAT TGT) and template combined together in a
96-well optical reaction plate (P/N 4306737; Applied
Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s recommended
concentrations. Sequencing reactions were set up as
recommended by Applied Biosystems’ BigDye ®

Bio-Rad Tetrad 2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA)
or ABI 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescently labeled extension products were purified following Applied Biosystems’ BigDye ® XTerminator™
purification protocol and subsequently processed on an

The EST sequences described in this article were
deposited in NCBI’s DBEST database under accessions
HS415024 - HS416811. Coding sequences and their protein translations were submitted to GenBank under
accessions JI626169-JI626342.
Bioinformatic Tools and Procedures

This was done as described before [14,15] and is reproduced here for easiness of access to the reader: “Expressed
sequence tags (EST) were trimmed of primer and vector
sequences. The BLAST tool [59], CAP3 assembler [139]
and ClustalW [140] software were used to compare,
assemble, and align sequences, respectively. Phylogenetic
analysis and statistical neighbor-joining bootstrap tests of
the phylogenies were done with the Mega package [141].
For functional annotation of the transcripts, we used the
tool blastx [59] to compare the nucleotide sequences to
the NR protein database of the NCBI and to the Gene
Ontology (GO) database [60]. The tool, reverse positionspecific BLAST (rpsblast)[59] was used to search for conserved protein domains in the Pfam [142], SMART [143],
Kog [144] and conserved domains databases (CDD) [61].
We also compared the transcripts with other subsets of
mitochondrial and rRNA nucleotide sequences downloaded from NCBI. Segments of the three-frame translations of the ESTs (because the libraries were
unidirectional, six-frame translations were not used), starting with a methionine found in the first 300 predicted
amino acids (AAs), or the predicted protein translation in
the case of complete coding sequences, were submitted to
the SignalP server [62] to help identify translation products that could be secreted. O-glycosylation sites on the
proteins were predicted with the program NetOGlyc
[131]. Functional annotation of the transcripts was based
on all the comparisons above. Following inspection of all
these results, transcripts were classified as either secretory
(S), housekeeping (H), or of unknown (U) function, with
further subdivisions based on function and/or protein
families. Putative sequences deriving from transposable
elements (TE) were also found.”

Proteomic Characterization Using One-Dimensional Gel
Electrophoresis and Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS)

The soluble protein fraction from SGHs from S. guianense corresponding to approximately 50 μg of protein
was brought up in reducing Laemmli gel-loading buffer.
The sample was boiled for 10 min and resolved on a
NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris precast gel. The separated proteins were visualized by staining with SimplyBlue (Invitrogen). The gel was sliced into 32 individual sections
that were destained and digested overnight with trypsin
at 37°C. Peptides were extracted and desalted using ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and resuspended in 0.1%
TFA prior to S analysis.
Nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem MS (RPLS-MS/MS) was performed using an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system (Agilent Technologies,
Palo Alto, CA) coupled online with a linear ion-trap
(LIT) mass spectrometer (LTQ, ThermoElectron, San
José, CA). This was done as described before [14,15]
and is reproduced here for easiness of access to the
reader: “NanoRPLC columns were slurry-packed inhouse with 5 μm, 300-Å pore size C-18 phage (Jupiter,
Phenomenex, CA) in a 75-μm i.d. × 10-cm fused silica
capillary (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) with a
flame-pulled tip. After sample injection, the column was
washed for 30 min with 98% mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) at 0.5 μL/min, and peptides were
eluted using a linear gradient of 2% mobile phase B
(0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) to 42% mobile phase B
in 40 min at 0.25 μL/min, then to 98% B for an additional 10 min. The liner ion-trap mass spectrometer was
operated in a data-dependent MS/MS mode in which
each full MS scan was followed by seven MS/MS scans
where the seven most abundant molecular ions were
dynamically selected for collision-induced dissociation
using a normalized collision energy of 35%. Dynamic
exclusion was applied to minimize repeated selection of
peptides previously selected for collision-induced
dissociation.
Tandem mass spectra were searched using SEQUEST
on a 20-node Beowulf cluster against an S. guianense
proteome database with methionine oxidation included
as dynamic modification. Only tryptic peptides with up
to two missed cleavage sites meeting a specific
SEQUEST scoring criteria [delta correlation (ΔC n ) ≥
0.08 and charge-state-dependent cross correlation (Xcorr)
≥ 1.9 for [M + H]1+, ≥ 2.2 for [M + 2H]2+, and ≥ 3.5 for
[M + 3H] 3+ ] were considered as legitimate identifications. The peptides identified by MS were converted to
Prosite block format [145] by a program written in
Visual Basic. This database was used to search matches
in the Fasta-formatted database of salivary proteins,
using the poorly documented program Seedtop, which is
part of the BLAST package. The result of the Seedtop

search is piped into the hyperlinked spreadsheet to produce a text file, such as the one shown for the apyrase
proteins SV-2008. Notice that the ID lines indicate, for
example, BF18_73, which means that one match was
found for fragment number 73 from gel band 18.
Because the same tryptic fragment can be found in
many gel bands, another program was written to count
the number of fragments for each gel band, displaying a
summarized result in an Excel table. The summary in
this form of BF11®18| BF12®18| BF13®2| indicates
that 18 fragments were found in band 11, while 18 and
2 peptides were found in bands 12 and 13, respectively.
Furthermore, this summary included protein identification only when two or more peptide matches to the
protein were obtained from the same gel slice.”
