Abstract
Background: Within eukaryotes there is a complex cascade of RNA-based macromolecules that
process other RNA molecules, especially mRNA, tRNA and rRNA. An example is RNase MRP
processing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in ribosome biogenesis. One hypothesis is that this complexity
was present early in eukaryotic evolution; an alternative is that an initial simpler network later
gained complexity by gene duplication in lineages that led to animals, fungi and plants. Recently
there has been a rapid increase in support for the complexity-early theory because the vast
majority of these RNA-processing reactions are found throughout eukaryotes, and thus were likely
to be present in the last common ancestor of living eukaryotes, herein called the Eukaryotic
Ancestor.
Results: We present an overview of the RNA processing cascade in the Eukaryotic Ancestor and
investigate in particular, RNase MRP which was previously thought to have evolved later in
eukaryotes due to its apparent limited distribution in fungi and animals and plants. Recent
publications, as well as our own genomic searches, find previously unknown RNase MRP RNAs,
indicating that RNase MRP has a wide distribution in eukaryotes. Combining secondary structure
and promoter region analysis of RNAs for RNase MRP, along with analysis of the target substrate
(rRNA), allows us to discuss this distribution in the light of eukaryotic evolution.
Conclusion: We conclude that RNase MRP can now be placed in the RNA-processing cascade of
the Eukaryotic Ancestor, highlighting the complexity of RNA-processing in early eukaryotes.
Promoter analyses of MRP-RNA suggest that regulation of the critical processes of rRNA cleavage
can vary, showing that even these key cellular processes (for which we expect high conservation)
show some species-specific variability. We present our consensus MRP-RNA secondary structure
as a useful model for further searches.

Background
There is high interest in discovering new roles of RNA in
modern eukaryotes [1-4]. The number of putative ncRNAs
(non-coding RNAs) in the mammals alone has increased
about 20-fold in the last five years [1], thus any information on the origins and functions of well-established
ncRNAs is relevant and timely. In eukaryotes a number of
ncRNA-based molecules are directly involved in the cleavage and processing of other RNA molecules. A classic
example is the cleavage of rRNA transcript by RNase MRP,
a ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of a single RNA
molecule and about 10 proteins [5-7]. The processing of
RNA by RNA can extend through several layers such as the
snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs) in the spliceosome release
snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNAs) from introns which in
turn are involved in the modification of rRNA, tRNA or
snoRNAs (see Figure 1). The network of these processes is
called the eukaryotic RNA-processing cascade [8]. This
cascade centres on the processing mRNA, tRNA and rRNA
and although each of these RNAs is cleaved in separate
reactions, there are linkages between these reactions as
shown in Figure 1. The question we ask here is: how
ancient are these RNA-based processes?
Pre-mRNA contains introns that are processed by the spliceosome (consisting of 5 snRNAs and ~200 proteins) [911] but there is also further processing such as the addition of the 5'-cap and 3' poly-A-tail [12]. Although the
capping and polyadenylation processes are not RNAbased reactions they do include some proteins found in
the spliceosome [9]. The snRNAs within the spliceosomal
complex not only direct the binding and coordination of
the splice sites but are also implicated in the catalysis of
the splicing reactions [13]. Some introns contain within
them ncRNAs such as snoRNAs (involved in modification
of rRNA, tRNA and snRNAs, reviewed in [14]) or miRNAs
involved in the degradation of mRNA [15-17]. Similarly,
pre-tRNA is processed by RNase P; a ribonucleoprotein
consisting in eukaryotes of a single RNA and about 8–10
proteins [18]. RNase P (abbreviated here as P) is found
throughout eukaryotes and prokaryotes [18,19], and thus
may date back to the RNA-world [20,21]. Pre-rRNA is
heavily processed and the A3 site in the ITS region is
cleaved by the ribonucleoprotein RNase MRP (abbreviated here as MRP) generating the mature 5.8S rRNA [2225].
MRP (Mitochondrial RNA Processing) was originally
identified as an RNA-protein endoribonuclease that processes RNA primers for DNA replication in the mitochondria [26]. However, the majority of MRP (99%) is
observed in the nucleolus where it is involved in pre-rRNA
processing [18]. MRP probably has other essential functions [27] including roles in chromosomal segregation
[28] and control of cell division [29]. Initial evolutionary

studies (including [7]) only used MRPs from animals (13
mammals and frog), yeasts (20 Saccharomycetalian yeasts
plus the fission yeast S. pombe) and plants (two dicotyledons). Although from the main multicellular groups,
these sequences covered only a limited range within each
group: land vertebrates within metazoans, Ascomycota
within fungi, and the core eudicots within plants, leaving
open the question whether MRP was present in the last
common ancestor of eukaryotes [7].
We earlier [7] considered three hypotheses for the distribution of MRP (Figure 2). The first is that MRP is very
ancient, occurring at least in the first eukaryotes. There are
many variants on this model, and MRP could even be
older in that most catalytic roles of RNA may derive from
earlier stages in the origin of life, such as in the RNA-world
[20]. Hypothesis B is that MRP arose from a duplication
of P within modern eukaryotes (i.e. after the Eukaryotic
Ancestor). This predicts a limited distribution of MRP in
eukaryotes as well as explains the observation that P and
MRP share most of their associated proteins [18]. Such
duplication would be followed by specialization of the
paralogous complexes, P being restricted to tRNA, and
MRP to rRNA. There are several sub-hypotheses under this
model, whether MRP took a new role in an internal excision in the rRNA precursor, or whether in eukaryotes, P
initially carried out both reactions (with the precursors of
tRNA and of rRNA) [7]. Hypothesis C is that MRP is
derived from an early mitochondrial RNase P, followed by
transfer of the gene to the nucleus, and co-option of MRP
to a role in the nucleus in processing rRNA. Thus it is
unclear whether the first role of MRP was in the nucleus
and was later co-opted into a role in the mitochondrion,
or vice versa.
In our earlier work it was concluded that the Hypothesis B
was the most likely, that MRP had arisen within eukaryotes by a duplication of P, with subsequent specialization.
The evidence against MRP coming from mitochondria
(Hypothesis C) was that the secondary structure of MRPRNA, as measured by RNA-shape metrics [7], was more
similar to the eukaryote RNase P RNA than to the RNA
from bacterial RNase P (the presumed source of the mitochondrial RNase P). Similarly, the apparent limited distribution of MRP in eukaryotes (at that time only in animals,
fungi and plants) made it seem unlikely that MRP was
present in the ancestral eukaryote. This left the duplication of P within eukaryotes (Hypothesis B) as the most
likely. Two developments have changed our conclusions.
Firstly, it now appears that the plant lineage and the fungi
and animal lineage are widely separated on the eukaryote
tree [30] and secondly, the recent characterisation of MRP
in additional groups (as reported here and [31]) means
that our initial conclusion must be reconsidered.

The eukaryotic RNA-processing cascade
The eukaryotic RNA-processing cascade. mRNA is cleaved by the spliceosome (comprised of snRNAs and proteins) to release the processed mRNA and introns. Some introns contain snoRNAs which in turn modify snRNAs,
tRNAs and rRNAs. RNase P (P) cleaves pre-tRNA while RNase MRP (MRP) cleaves rRNA. The ribosomal complex (comprised
of rRNAs) brings the tRNAs and mature mRNAs together for translation. The involvement of RNase P in pre-rRNA processing has been questioned recently in [59].

Piccinelli [31] recently extended the range of species from
which MRP-RNA is characterised to include several protist
species including apicomplexa. We have also used an
MRP-search strategy to find candidate MRP-RNA
sequences in other eukaryotic species. We have further
examined MRP-RNA secondary structure and promoter
regions from all known sequences to strengthen consensus models for MRP-RNA throughout eukaryotes. In the
light of these results we discuss the presence of MRP in the
last common ancestor of modern eukaryotes and re-examine its evolution and its relationship within the RNAprocessing cascade throughout eukaryotic lineages.
Because the deep divergences of eukaryotes is not known
[30,32], our strategy has been to find candidate RNAs in
as many lineages as possible, thus making our conclusions independent of the precise rooting of the eukaryotic
tree [33].

Results
RNase MRP found throughout eukaryotes using specific
search strategies
MRP-RNA as a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is not easy to
identify in genomic sequences. Piccinelli [31] used a strategy based on hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of the P4
region of the MRP-RNA secondary structure to identify it
in many eukaryotes. Our search strategy (in Materials and
Methods) was also based on this P4 region and found
MRP-RNA sequences from additional species. A eukaryotic tree (based on [32]) showing species from which MRPRNA has been characterised is shown in Figure 3, and a
full list of species is given in Additional File 1.

Our MRP-RNA candidates were checked against existing
gene records and EST databases to support our bioinformatic approach. Of our new MRP-RNA candidates, two

and eukaryotic evolution. The large black dots represent the point of duplication of the P-MRP ancestor. A: MRP was present

are found in EST databases: D. melanogaster [GenBank:
CO153932] and Plasmodium yoelii [GenBank: BM161600
and GenBank: BM160961]. Validation of the MRP-RNA
candidate from Cryptosporidium parvum with RT-PCR
shows that this sequence is expressed in trophozoites (M.
Irimia, data not shown). These Plasmodium and C. parvum results are particularly important because they show
expression outside the animal, fungi and plant groups. In
addition, five of our MRP-RNA sequences occur in Genbank records (excluding total sequence data): G. gallus
[GenBank: AADN01006913], T. nigroviridis [GenBank:
CAAE01012081], P. falciparum [GenBank: NC_004325]
and P. yoelii [GenBank: AABL01002665]. That these do
not overlap coding sequences is additional support for
our computational approach. Interestingly, the candidate
for the D. melanogaster MRP-RNA is on the negative strand
of an intron in the Dmel_CG10365 gene [GenBank:
AE014297], although the function of this gene is still
unknown.
A single copy of the MRP-RNA gene was found in most
species. However, the sea-urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpu-

ratus, appears to have five closely related sequences,
although some could turn out to be artefacts of the current
assembly. Multiple MRP-RNA genes have been observed
in plants [34]. Humans [35] typically have a single true
copy and a number of pseudogenes and studies of the
MRP in the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes [36] indicate only
a single copy in this species.
As before [7,31] we did not find any MRP-RNA candidate
in the Diplomonad Giardia lamblia. We examined the
rRNA organisation in G. lamblia to determine if an A3 site,
normally cleaved by MRP, was present. The order of rRNA
subunits are in general similar throughout eukaryotes [37]
(Figure 4A), though there is variation in the length and
composition of ITS regions. Some microsporidia (e.g. E.
cuniculi and Nosema apis) contain no ITS2 region and have
no cleavage between the 5.8S and the 28S rRNA subunits.
Another group of microsporidia, including Nosema bombycis and N. spodopterae, are exceptions to the standard
eukaryote ordering, having the fused 5.8S/28S subunit
before the 18S rRNA subunit [38]. G. lamblia rRNA has the
standard ordering of eukaryotic rRNA, and its ITS1 region

can be folded into a secondary structure with a short six
nucleotide single stranded region between the two helices,
a possible A3 cleavage site (Figure 4B). The ITS1 region
from Trichomonas vaginalis (from which an MRP has been
characterised) folds into a helix followed by an AC rich
single-stranded region which could be the cleavage site for
MRP. Future experimental analysis will determine the
exact cleavage sites in these ITS regions.
The characterisation of MRP across a wide range of eukaryotes indicates that the evolutionary relationship between
MRP and P is ancient, and that both MRP and P are likely
to have been present in the last common ancestor of modern eukaryotes. Although seemingly obvious, this distribution analysis importantly places MRP in the RNAprocessing cascade present in the Eukaryotic Ancestor and
further allows us to examine other characteristics of MRP
and its relationship to other processes present in this
ancient cascade.
Promoter analysis of candidate MRP-RNA sequences
With MRP the genes for proteins and for RNA are transcribed by different RNA polymerases; the protein genes
by RNA Polymerase II, and the RNA by RNA Polymerase
III (Type III promoter for U6 snRNA, 7SK and P-RNA;
Type I for 5S rRNA,) [35,39,40]. RNA polymerase III transcription of MRP-RNA, P-RNA and U6 snRNAs has been

characterised for some animal, plant and fungal species.
Analysis of upstream regions of MRP-RNAs and the literature allowed us to analyse the promoter elements associated with RNA polymerase III transcription of MRP-RNA
to determine if there was any conservation of its promoter
elements.
We find that MRP-RNA is probably transcribed by RNA
polymerase III throughout eukaryotes but the set of RNA
Polymerase III promoter elements may vary (see Figure 5).
In general, vertebrate and plant MRP-RNA promoter
regions contain an upstream TATA box, Proximal
Sequence Element (PSE or USE) and a Distal Sequence
Element (DSE) which can contain SP1, Staf and/or
Octamer motifs [34,39-43]. In humans, the presence of
the TATA box determines RNA polymerase specificity (i.e.
RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III), with the other
elements (e.g. PSE and DSE) enhancing transcription
[44]. Plants require both the TATA box and the USE promoter (similar to the PSE element in vertebrates) with
polymerase specificity determined by the spacing between
the two elements [45]. In Drosophila, specificity is determined by the presence of the TATA box and the sequence
of the PSE element [46]. However, the yeast S. cerevisiae
uses a different RNA polymerase III promoter structure
[44]. For example, the U6 snRNA promoter (similar to
that expected in MRP-RNA) lacks PSE and DSE elements

Promoter regions of Human MRP, P and U6
Promoter regions of Human MRP, P and U6.A. Organization of pre-rRNA based on [37]. In bacteria rRNA genes are
co-transcribed as a polycistronic precursor (although exceptions are common). Most eukaryotes vary only in the length of
their ITS regions, an extreme case being the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi which has completely lost its ITS2 having a
fused 5.8S/28S subunit. RNase P and RNase MRP do not cleave the main transcripts but trim the ends of their respective substrates (the tRNA or 5.8S rRNA) after cleavage by other enzymes. In eukaryotes the 5S rRNA is transcribed separately by
RNA polymerase III. B. The Diplomonad Giardia lamblia has the usual order of rRNA subunits with short ITS regions, however
RNase MRP has not yet been characterized from this species. RNAstructure folding of G. lamblia ITS1 [56] showing a single
stranded region between two stem loops that could possibly be an A3 site. Other foldings of this sequence and foldings of
other sequences (DQ157272 and AF239841) produce just a single stem-loop.

but instead includes a downstream B box ~120 nucleotides beyond the terminator [44].
Promoter comparisons show there can be differences in
MRP-RNA promoter elements between some closely
related species. For example in fish, the MRP-RNA promoter region for Takifugu previously described in [36]
characterises a Staf promoter element (a binding site for
the Staf transcriptional activator protein) in the DSE. We
are unable to find any Staf-binding sequence in the other
two fish MRP-RNAs. The Zebrafish and T. nigroviridis
MRP-RNAs have potential SP1 binding sites, but as with
the Takifugu, no Octamer sites could be determined.
Mammals and chicken MRP-RNAs contain a similar
arrangement of their MRP-RNA promoter elements. The

frog MRP-RNA promoter regions have sequence motifs
similar to mammals with a slightly different spacing
between the elements within the DSE (the SP1 binding
site is further upstream). Comparisons of six species of
Drosophila (D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, D. yakuba,
D. mojavensis, D. virilis and D. ananassae) show a conserved PSE element (consensus sequence gcTTAtaATTCCCAAct) 23 nucleotides upstream of a TATA box
(consensus sequence taaAta) which is about 16 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. The range of
RNA polymerase III promoter structures and the lack of
information about these promoter elements from protists
make it difficult to identify promoter elements from protist MRP-RNA genes. Preliminary analyses of promoter
regions from apicomplexa (Plasmodium and Cryptosporid-

richness of this region makes promoter prediction difficult until such time as we have more experimental information about promoters in apicomplexa. A table of
promoter elements is available from the corresponding
author upon request.
Secondary structure analysis of MRP-RNA
Analysis of the secondary structure of MRP-RNA (Fig. 6
and [25,31,47,48]) shows that the overall secondary
structure is conserved throughout eukaryotes (Figure 6).

Our naming of secondary structures in Figure 6 follows
the convention that MRP-features are named after putatively homologous P-RNA features [25,49]. Features P1,
P2, P3a, P4, P8 and P10 are found throughout all the
MRP-RNA characterised to date while other features are
nearly universal (P3b, P9 and eP19). A few features are
observed in a limited phylogenetic range. Our consensus
structure in Figure 6 is largely sequence independent,
showing only the most conserved sequence motifs. This
type of structure is essential for generating useful structure
models for future computational searches for MRP-RNA.

Figure 6
Summary diagram of MRP-RNA secondary structure
Summary diagram of MRP-RNA secondary structure. Black features (P1, P2, P3a, P4, P5, P7) are universally present.
Green features are nearly universal, red features are observed in a few organisms of limited phylogenetic range. Thick lines are
paired regions while unpaired regions are shown as thin lines. Conserved sequence motifs are indicated for the P4 (5' and 3')
P8 and CRIV regions.

Details of the consensus MRP-RNA secondary structure
are as follows. P3 nearly universally has two helices (P3a,
P3b) separated by an internal loop; except for the absence
of P3b in microsporidia and an additional P3c helix in
Cryptosporidia, Dictyostelium discoideum, Anopheles and
the nematode Brugia malayi. The P10 helix is often long,

typically 20–40 nucleotides, but in extreme cases (Pezizomycotina and Cryptosporidia) over 200 nucleotides. P15/
ymP7 is present in Saccharomycetes yeasts and some apicomplexa. ymP8 is present in S. pombe, all Saccharomycetes with known MRP-RNAs, and some Pezizomycotina
yeasts. The distinction between ymP7 and ymP8 is not

always clear (e.g. Coccidioides immitis). There are some species-specific divergences from our secondary structure
model. P19 is absent from Ciona intestinalis and P6 is
absent from microsporidia and D. discoideum. P6 is absent
from Cryptosporidia in previously published secondary
structures [31], but these sequences can have an alternative folding which includes the P6 helix.
The GARAR motif (R = A or G), recently noted by [31] and
discussed by [25] is present in most species to date and is
a defining feature of the P8 helix. It is usually in a pentaloop with an occasional deletion to a tetraloop (GARA)
[25]. The major variants of the motif are GARAR and
GARA but others are possible including the fish Tetraodon
nigroviridis (CAAAG), cabbage Brassica oleracea (GAGG),
Babesia bovis (TAAAG) and Eimeria tenella (GCGAG).
Cryptosporidia, Plasmodia, T. vaginalis and some ascomycete fungi do not appear to have the GARAR motif. The
three basidiomycete fungi also have varied GARAR motifs;
two species (Coprinus cinereus and Laccaria bicolor) have
GAAAG as part of a bulge on P8. This region is suggested
by [25] to be an MRP-specific region and thus will be
important in the development of more MRP-specific
search strategies. Another nearly universal motif is CR-IV
(positioned 0–3 nucleotides before 3'P2). The sequence is
AnAGUnA, the 'U' and the first 'A' sometimes being substituted. This motif is not recognisable in T. vaginalis and
some Alveolata. In S. purpuratus (sea-urchin) the motif is
in a non-standard position, overlapping and extending
beyond P2.

Discussion
The RNA cascade connects a number of RNA-based complexes where RNA is processing other RNA molecules. Figure 1 is a simplified model that shows the key processes
and the main connections. Key processing complexes
such as the spliceosome (snRNAs) [33], RNase P [19] and
snoRNPs [50] are all seen as being ancestral to modern
eukaryotes, even though details such as the intron recognition by the spliceosome [51] cannot yet be determined.
The discovery of MRP across so many eukaryotes indicates
that it was also part of this ancestral RNA-processing cascade. Given that MRP occurred so early in eukaryotes it is
not surprising that MRP is now implicated in a number of
other cellular processes (especially in well-studied species
such as humans and yeast S. cerevisiae). As well as nuclear
rRNA and mitochondrial primer cleavage functions, in S.
cerevisiae at least, it has an additional function of promoting cell cycle progressing by cleaving CLB2 mRNA in its 5'
UTR region at the end of mitosis [52,53]. It is possible that
other functions of MRP may be found, especially when
other RNA-processing systems are investigated.
One main conclusion from this study is that, with the
placement of MRP in the RNA-processing cascade of the

Eukaryotic Ancestor, we see little change in basic RNAprocessing throughout eukaryotes. Eukaryotes and
prokaryotes have basic differences in their processing of
their rRNA transcripts [37]; the main eukaryotic transcript
contains ITS1 (between the 18S and 5.8S) and ITS2
(between the 5.8S and 28S) whereas prokaryotes generally
have only an ITS1 with the 5'end of the prokaryotic 23S
with strong homology to the eukaryotic 5.8S sequence
[54] (Figure 4A). Thus we find the 5.8S rRNA, either
cleaved as a separate subunit, or fused to the large rRNA
subunit (no ITS2 present). Typically within eukaryotes we
find the 5.8S rRNA cleaved but not in prokaryotes. There
are exceptions for both, microsporidia do not appear to
have an ITS2 [55,56], and in prokaryotes RNase III cleaved
IVS (intervening sequence) regions in α-proteobacteria
have been found [54]. RNase III, which is involved in
cleaving the prokaryotic rRNA transcript has now been
implicated in ITS1 processing in S. pombe [57]. It is likely
that the Eukaryotic Ancestor contained cleaved 5.8S
rRNA, but we cannot yet determine if the last universal
common ancestor (of eukaryotes and prokaryotes) contained a separate or fused 5.8S.
The cleavage of site A3 in the ITS1 region by MRP is similar to the cleavage of the tRNA in the bacterial system by
P. However, we do not know whether the eukaryotic-type
of RNA-processing cascade has evolved from the bacterial
RNA-processing system. Bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes
have probably changed their original RNA-processing cascade, each in their own evolutionary trajectory [58]. Nor
do we know whether the ancestral P had either a simplified bacterial-like form (with a single protein), or had
multiple proteins (like eukaryotes) which have been
reduced in prokaryotes to a single protein. One piece of
evidence for this second hypothesis is that the human
Rpp29 (pop4) protein, shared by P and MRP, acts as a
cofactor for the E. coli P-RNA [25]. We can no longer make
the assumption that the prokaryotic models of RNase P
and RNA-processing are ancestors of the eukaryotic complexes.
The high similarity of secondary structure between MRP
and P [7] is indicative of an evolutionarily relationship,
probably maintained by the sharing of numerous proteins
between the MRP and P. However, it appears likely that P
and MRP were already separate in the Eukaryotic Ancestor. The association of proteins with their respective MRP
and P-RNAs may differ not only between P and MRP but
may also vary between species [59]. Thus much of the
large similarity in secondary structure between sections of
MRP and P-RNAs (e.g. the P3-region indicated in [31]) is
likely due to the constraints placed on the RNA molecules
by their interactions with their common proteins even if
some proteins interact transiently in some species.

The GARAG motif is an interesting addition to the MRPRNA secondary structure. This pentaloop (or sometimes
tetraloop) is potentially a protein or RNA binding site,
which would explain its conserved nature. GNRA tetraloop motifs are also found in bacterial P (Type B but not
Type B), archaeal P (both Type A and Type M) and also
possibly in the ep9 helix of P from the yeast S. cerevisiae
[25]. They are also common features of other ncRNAs.
Identifying binding target sites for this motif in MRP may
aid in understanding some of the differential protein
binding [6]. The new consensus secondary structure
model gives information required for future search strategies. Computational analysis of ncRNAs often use secondary structure and highly conserved sequence motifs rather
than complete ncRNA sequences [7]. This model should
allow more sophisticated MRP-RNA search algorithms to
identify of MRP-RNA in additional eukaryotes.
The promoter region analysis indicates that RNA polymerase III is used throughout eukaryotes to transcribe MRPRNA. It is interesting that there is such a range of promoter
elements for MRP-RNA transcription and that the spacing
between different elements appears critical in some species and not others. This may indicate that the regulation
of MRP differs between groups of eukaryotes even for such
an essential function as rRNA cleavage. There is little
information about RNA polymerase III transcription in
protists and the possible promoter regions are seldom
reported when new ncRNAs are characterised.

proteins that are usually shared between P and MRP have
also been found in G. lamblia [65]. Two MRP-specific proteins (proteins not found in P, Smn1 and Rmp1) [66]
have been characterised only in yeast and thus using MRPspecific proteins to indicate the presence of MRP, is not an
option at this stage. The large evolutionary distance
between Diplomonads and the only excavate from which
MRP has previously been characterised (the Parabasalid,
Trichomonas vaginalis [31]) means that MRP may be difficult to characterise in G. lamblia and even other excavates
such as the Eugelenozoa (e.g. Trypanosoma brucei), using
present techniques in computational analysis which rely
heavily on sequence homology in the P4 region.
It is likely that the major protein and RNA components of
the RNA processing cascade evolved before the Eukaryotic
Ancestor (which is now seen to have come after the mitochondrial endosymbiosis [67]) It is interesting that MRP
is still found in species that no longer contain mitochondria [31], but contain instead reduced organelles such as
mitosomes or remnant mitochondria (apicomplexa and
microsporidia) and hydrogenosomes (ciliates, parabasalids and some fungi) [67].
The RNA-processing cascade is now seen as a complex feature of the ancestral eukaryotic cell. Only when we understand which eukaryotic processes were in the Eukaryotic
Ancestor we can then consider how they evolved.

Conclusion
Although MRP has been characterised in many eukaryotes, it has yet to be found in the nematodes C. elegans and
C. briggsae, although complete genomes have been available for these species for several years. Similar exceptions
are the protists Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica.
However, MRP-RNA [31], was found in another nematode species Brugia malayi [31]. P-RNA has only recently
been published for C. elegans [60] and G. lamblia [31,61]
but even with all this new information we were still unable to find MRP-RNA in the above species. A recent survey
for structured ncRNAs [62] based on comparative analysis
of C. elegans and C. briggsae again did not result in a plausible MRP-RNA candidate. We have also not yet recovered
any MRP-RNA from a G. lamblia RNA library (although we
have recovered P-RNA) (S.X. Chen, data not shown). Nevertheless, in C. elegans, G. lamblia and E. histolytica the
rRNA gene arrangement is generally the same as in other
eukaryotes [63], although the ITS1 regions are very short
in G. lamblia and E. histolytica [56]. Short ITS1 regions are
also found in other species with reduced genomes such as
Trichomonas vaginalis and the microsporidian E. cuniculi
both of which have had MRP-rRNAs [31]. G. lamblia does
not contain a nucleolus, but it is expected to contain a
eukaryotic-like rRNA processing system due to the presence of many pre-rRNA processing proteins [64]. Some

We present the organisation of RNA-processing in eukaryotes as a cascade of RNA-based processing reactions cleaving or modifying other RNA molecules. The main
components of this cascade are conserved throughout
eukaryotes and are likely to have been present in the
Eukaryotic ancestor. We can now place MRP in this cascade and thus basic RNA-processing has been preserved in
eukaryotes. Analysis of MRP-RNA promoter regions suggest, however, that regulation of these critical processes
differs between species showing that even these key cellular processes are showing some species-specific variability.
Computational searches for ncRNAs are difficult due to
the necessary incorporation of secondary structure as well
as sequence information. Our consensus secondary structure for MRP-RNA provides a useful model for further
search strategies.

Methods
Searching genomes for RNase MRP RNA
The conserved regions around the P4 pseudoknot are
important for finding potential candidate MRP-RNAs. A
genome is scanned for regions similar to the conserved
sequences from known MRP-RNAs then candidates are
evaluated for stereotypical secondary structure. Candidates with suitable secondary structure are evaluated for

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7(Suppl 1):S13

upstream promoter regions expected for a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase III, then blasted against EST
databases [68] for any indication that the candidate is
expressed.
In more detail, the algorithm allows the search of genome
sequences for closely located sequences which match or
nearly match the consensus 5'P4 and 3'P4 regions (taken
to be gaaAGuCCCC and acnnnanGGGGCUnannnu
respectively, paired bases in uppercase). We have three
levels of search criteria. Using the tightest criteria, 5'P4
and 3'P4 can be separated by 120 to 280 bases and we
allow just one deviation from the consensus (either a single substitution of an unpaired base, or a substitution of a
Watson-Crick pair by another such pair). The second,
slightly looser, search criteria allows 100 to 360 bases
between 5'P4 and 3'P4, and two deviations from the consensus. The loosest criteria allows a 80 to 500 base separation of P4, and two deviations from the consensus or a
single violation of the expected Watson-Crick pairings.
Genomes are scanned with the tightest criteria first, then
with subsequent relaxed criteria if the first scan fails to
identify an MRP candidate with suitable secondary structure. The Perl programs used are available upon request.

Secondary structure analysis of MRP-RNA
Vertebrate [47] and yeast [39] secondary structures were
obtained from the literature. For each new candidate
sequence, we use RNAfold [69] and Mfold [70] to fold
sequences of varying lengths prior to the 5'P4 region, to
find a candidate P3 structure, and similarly the region
prior to 3'P4 to find a candidate P9 structure. If successful,
this identifies a small region to search for the P2 structure.
Once these three structures are identified, the complete
structure is easily obtained. If the number of candidates
from the scanning stage is large, we use RNAmotif [61,71]
to filter out candidates that do not have suitable P2 and
P3 helices (RNAmotif descriptor files are available on
request). Where we have MRP candidates from closely
related species, we refine our structures by comparing
sequences with ClustalX [72] and DIALIGN [73], and
comparing structures using a range of RNA comparison
software (Alifold from the Vienna RNA package [74],
RNAforester [75], RNAshapes [76] and RNAcast [77]).
