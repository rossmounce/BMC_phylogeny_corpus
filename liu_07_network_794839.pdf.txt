Abstract
Background: A metabolic network is the sum of all chemical transformations or reactions in the cell,
with the metabolites being interconnected by enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Many enzymes exist in
numerous species while others occur only in a few. We ask if there are relationships between the
phylogenetic profile of an enzyme, or the number of different bacterial species that contain it, and its
topological importance in the metabolic network. Our null hypothesis is that phylogenetic profile is
independent of topological importance. To test our null hypothesis we constructed an enzyme network
from the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database. We calculated three network
indices of topological importance: the degree or the number of connections of a network node; closeness
centrality, which measures how close a node is to others; and betweenness centrality measuring how
frequently a node appears on all shortest paths between two other nodes.
Results: Enzyme phylogenetic profile correlates best with betweenness centrality and also quite closely
with degree, but poorly with closeness centrality. Both betweenness and closeness centralities are nonlocal measures of topological importance and it is intriguing that they have contrasting power of predicting
phylogenetic profile in bacterial species. We speculate that redundancy in an enzyme network may be
reflected by betweenness centrality but not by closeness centrality. We also discuss factors influencing the
correlation between phylogenetic profile and topological importance.
Conclusion: Our analysis falsifies the hypothesis that phylogenetic profile of enzymes is independent of
enzyme network importance. Our results show that phylogenetic profile correlates better with degree
and betweenness centrality, but less so with closeness centrality. Enzymes that occur in many bacterial
species tend to be those that have high network importance. We speculate that this phenomenon
originates in mechanisms driving network evolution. Closeness centrality reflects phylogenetic profile
poorly. This is because metabolic networks often consist of distinct functional modules and some are not
in the centre of the network. Enzymes in these peripheral parts of a network might be important for cell
survival and should therefore occur in many bacterial species. They are, however, distant from other
enzymes in the same network.

Background
Enzymes are proteins that catalyze metabolic reactions
vital for the survival and functioning of cells [1]. However,
there is no reason to suppose that all enzymes have equal
importance in metabolic pathways or that each enzyme
occurs in all species. There is, in fact, great heterogeneity
in the occurrence of particular enzymes within phylogenies [2]. Because enzymes are inherent parts of metabolic
networks, one way to explore the reasons for this heterogeneity is to examine the network characteristics of the
enzymes.
Many researchers have applied network analysis to various fields of molecular biology and have elucidated the
organization and evolution of different molecular networks [3,4]. In several molecular networks, the number of
connections of a network node tends to follow a power
law distribution: most nodes have few connections and
few nodes are well-connected to others [5-7]. These few
well-connected nodes play important roles in their respective networks. In a metabolic network, a well-connected
node is a metabolite acting as a hub, ensuring fast and efficient interconversions of metabolites [5]. Well-connected
proteins or genes in protein-protein or genetic interaction
networks seem to be vital for the survival of cells [6,7]. A
power law distribution of nodal connections is likely to
render a molecular network robust to random errors but
vulnerable to targeted attacks [3,8].
One possible mechanism that might produce a power law
distribution of links is if, during evolution, new nodes
tend to attach preferentially to well connected network
nodes [3,8].
An enzyme-enzyme relationship can be defined for two
enzymes if the product of one is the substrate of the other
[9,10]. It is therefore relatively easy to construct an
enzyme-enzyme relation network (hereafter "enzyme network") from known metabolic reactions [9,10]. Recently,
network analysis has been applied to enzyme or metabolic networks of specific organisms to reveal the underlying network structure [11] and to determine the
phylogenetic distances between different species [12,13].
It has also been used to elucidate the mechanism of
enzyme evolution[14,15] and to investigate the robustness of metabolic networks to damage such as enzyme
deletion [16]. In this paper, we adopt a different approach
by compiling all known enzyme-enzyme relations for a
major group of organisms into an enzyme network. We
also determine the phylogenetic profile for each enzyme
(a term originally used by Pellegrini et al. [17]), which is
the number of different species having a particular
enzyme. We then determine the topological or positional
importance of every individual enzyme in the enzyme
network we had constructed. The specific null hypothesis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/121

we test is that the phylogenetic profile of enzymes is independent of their positional importance within the network. We examine whether enzymes with major
topological roles occur more frequently (i.e. have higher
phylogenetic profiles). This question can now be examined because recent advances in molecular biology have
led to the production of metabolic pathway databases for
hundreds of organisms [2,18]. A well-developed set of
network indices is also now available that can quantify the
topological importance of individual nodes[19,20] that
have been used to reveal the connectivity structure and
centrality of metabolic networks [21,22]. The metabolic
databases provide information from which one can easily
construct the enzyme network and determine the phylogenetic profile of enzymes. We use such information from
a large database of metabolic pathways in bacterial species
to test our null hypothesis. We also use several subsidiary
tests to examine the characteristics of the local environments of enzymes. We then discuss possible reasons for
the link between phylogenetic profile and topological
importance, if such a link does indeed exist.

Results and Discussion
We constructed an enzyme network by combining information on all the enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions
of 288 bacterial species from the KEGG database [2] (see
Methods). In this network, a node represents an individual enzyme. A link between two enzymes exists if the
product of one enzyme is the substrate of the other (Figure
1): we assume that reactions are reversible and therefore
each link or enzyme-enzyme relation in the network is
undirected. The enzyme network constructed from the
KEGG database has 1081 nodes (i.e. enzymes) and 4169
links (i.e. enzyme-enzyme relation). As in many other
molecular networks [3,5-8], the number of connections of
a node tends to follow a power law distribution, P(k)~k-γ
(i.e. a scale-free network), where P(k) is the probability
that a node has k connections and γ is an exponent with
an estimated value of 1.55 (r2 = 0.862) for the network
shown here (Figure 2). This suggests that most nodes in
this enzyme network are sparsely connected while only a
few have many connections to others. Networks with
power-law distributions in their connectivity, or scale-free
networks, are known to be robust against random errors
or node deletion; in other words they are less likely to disintegrate into isolated parts when nodes are randomly
removed from them [3,8].
Correlation between phylogenetic profile and topological
importance of enzymes
From KEGG we determined the phylogenetic profile (F) of
every enzyme in the network. This is the number of the
288 bacterial species that contain a given enzyme. The
value of F is extremely variable (Figure 3) with a range of
1–251. Many enzymes occur in only one bacterial species,

but one enzyme occurs in 251 of the 288 species in the
database.
For every enzyme in this network, we calculated three topological indices [19-22] (see Methods): "degree" (D – the
number of direct neighbors a node has); "closeness centrality" (C – how close a node is to all others in the same
network); and "betweenness centrality" (B – how frequently a node appears on all shortest paths between all
pairs of nodes in the network). The Spearman rank correlations between the phylogenetic profile and each of the
three measures of topological importance were all significant. This falsifies our null hypothesis that phylogenetic
profile and measures of positional importance are independent. Enzymes that occur in more bacterial species
tend to occupy more important topological positions in
the network. The F-B and F-D correlations are positive but
that of F-C is slightly negative. Of the three correlations,
the strongest is between F and B (rF, B = 0.35, p ≈ 0), followed by that between F and D (rF, D = 0.30, p ≈ 0) and
lastly, that between F and C (rF, C = -0.06, p = 0.03).
However, these relationships are very noisy, as demonstrated by the graphs of F against D, C and B (Figure 4a,
4c, 4e). Since our knowledge of metabolic pathways is not
complete for each of the organisms examined, and other
processes not accounted for by measures of topological
importance might affect the phylogenetic profile, our
results will contain a certain degree of inaccuracy or uncertainty. To reduce the noise and reveal more general relationships, we ranked the enzymes according to their
phylogenetic profiles and divided them into groups of
100. For each group, we calculated the average phylogenetic profile and the corresponding average measure of
topological importance. Using these averaged values, the
rank correlations of phylogenetic profile with degree (rF, D
= 0.91, p = 0.0042) and betweenness centrality (rF, B =

0.95, p = 0.0027) were again significant, and more evident; both these measures of topological importance tend
to increase with phylogenetic profile (Figure 4b, 4f).
However, the correlation between phylogenetic profile
and closeness centrality became insignificant (rF, C = -0.12,
p = 0.68, Figure 4d). Similarly, when we divided the
enzymes into groups of 50s, the rank correlations of phylogenetic profile with degree and betweenness centrality
remained stronger and more evident than that with closeness centrality (rF, D = 0.84, p = 0.0001; rF, B = 0.83, p =
0.0001; rF, C = -0.065, p = 0.7641).
These results suggest that simple measures of topological
importance can reveal interesting information about heterogeneities in the phylogenetic profile of enzymes. We
found that betweenness is a good predictor of how many
bacterial species have a particular enzyme, closely followed by degree. The relationship with closeness is much
weaker or non-existent. The differences in predictive ability among these topological measures might reflect the
structural organization of the enzyme network. Enzymes
incident to many shortest paths between any other two
enzymes (i.e. high betweenness) tend to occur in most
bacterial species. This reflects the central role that such
enzymes play in relaying metabolites from one enzyme to
another. These enzymes can be considered positionally
critical nodes; deleting them might compromise the integrity of the enzyme or metabolic network. Such enzymes
should therefore occur in many bacterial species.
Betweenness centrality not only takes account of local
information (i.e. how well or richly an enzyme is connected to its neighbors), but also reflects in a semi-global
manner how a node is embedded in a network. The most
local measure of topological importance, degree, performs slightly less well in reflecting the phylogenetic profile of enzymes. Closeness centrality reveals an interesting
insight. It is also a measure of topological importance
based on how a node connects to others in the same network, but our results show that it relates poorly to phylogenetic profile. An explanation for the contrasting
correlations between phylogenetic profile and the two
non-local network indices may arise from the way in
which closeness and betweenness centralities measure the
topological importance of nodes. The closeness centralities of a node and its direct neighbors should be similar.
This is because a node and its direct neighbors are only
one link apart in a network. Thus, if the focal node is close
to other nodes, then its direct neighbors are also likely to
be close to other nodes in the same network. Conversely,
if a node is far away from others, then its direct neighbors
are also more likely to be far away from others. This might
not be true for betweenness centrality, however, because
shortest paths that pass through a given node might not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/121

that "being on many shortest paths" (i.e. high betweenness) is a quality required by enzymes with high phylogenetic profiles. They also suggest that enzymes with low
betweenness centrality might be bypassed and become
redundant. Such enzymes may then be prone to deletion
from metabolic pathways and would therefore not occur
in many bacterial species, resulting in low phylogenetic
profiles. We develop this idea more fully in the next section.

pass through some of this node's immediate neighbors.
Therefore, the closeness centrality of a node and its immediate neighbors will vary less than their betweenness centrality. The enzyme EC 2.7.1.69, a phosphotransferase
involved in the phosphorylation of D-glucose in glycolysis, illustrates this distinction. EC 2.7.1.69 exists in 144
bacterial species, and it ranks 8th and 61st in betweenness
and closeness centralities respectively. The neighborhood
of EC2.7.1.69, the focal node surrounded by its immediate neighbors, produces two sub-networks. In these otherwise identical sub-networks, node sizes are proportional
to different node values: in the first to closeness centrality
(Figure 5a), and in the second to betweenness centrality
(Figure 5b). Betweenness centrality appears to vary more
between EC2.7.1.69 and its direct neighbors than does
closeness centrality. Furthermore, in a similar neighborhood plot, phylogenetic profile also tends to vary more in
the immediate vicinity of EC2.7.1.69 than does closeness
centrality (Figure 5a, 5c). To substantiate this claim quantitatively for all nodes in the network, we ranked enzymes
separately by closeness centrality, betweenness centrality
and phylogenetic profile. We then defined a neighborhood for each node comprising itself and its direct neighbors, and calculated the variance of the ranks of the nodes
in this neighborhood. In general, our results show that the
ranks of enzymes in a given neighborhood tend to vary
more for betweenness centrality than for closeness centrality (Figure 6). Furthermore, we found that the variance
of ranks for phylogenetic profile in a node's neighborhood correlates with the variance of ranks for betweenness centrality (r = 0.25, p ≈ 0) but not for closeness
centrality (r = -0.01, p = 0.56). Our findings thus indicate

Redundancy in an enzyme network
Metabolic networks in many species have short average
path lengths similar to those in a random network. This
means that only a small number of reaction steps [5] connect any two metabolites. It is feasible, therefore, to envisage that nature might favor metabolic networks of a
particular design that allows the rapid and reliable interconversion of metabolites. Consequently, an enzyme on
the shortest pathway between two given enzymes should
be more likely to be selected to perform a role in metabolism than enzymes on longer pathways. Our results imply
this. If an enzyme is incident to many shortest paths
between other enzymes (i.e. it has high betweenness centrality), then it tends to be found in many bacterial species. However, neighbors of such enzymes might have low
betweenness centrality and therefore be less likely to occur
in different bacterial species. In other words, if evolution
favors efficient inter-conversion of metabolites, then
direct neighbors of enzymes with high betweenness centrality might not be selected to play a role in metabolism
and will thus become redundant.

Our rationale for investigating the issue of redundancy in
the enzyme network is as follows. Imagine a linear relationship between three enzymes A, B and C, where there
is a link between A and B and a link between B and C. If
such a relationship is vital for cellular function in a bacterial species, then the presence of one enzyme should more
or less guarantee the presence of the other two. Therefore,
bacterial species having enzyme B should also have
enzymes A and C. If there is a shortcut that links A and C
directly, then the role of B will become redundant. Such a
shortcut may provide an organism with "choices" of alternative routes of enzyme-enzyme relations, therefore some
species might "select" enzymes A, B and C while some
might go for enzymes A and C only. To test this idea, we
determined the overlap fraction (βi, jk) between a given
enzyme (i) and every pair of its direct neighbors (j and k)
(see Methods). βi, jk is defined as the ratio of the number
of bacterial species having enzymes i, j and k to the
number of bacterial species having enzymes j and k but
not i.
We speculate that if there are many direct connections
between the immediate neighbors of an enzyme, then this

0). Therefore, enzymes on many shortest paths tend to be
located in poorly-interconnected neighborhoods; and
enzymes in well-interconnected neighborhoods are
unlikely to be on many of the shortest paths because there
are bypasses via interconnected neighbors. Consequently,
enzymes that have fewer bypasses around them (via interconnected neighbors) are essential to ensure the proper
functioning of sequences of metabolic reactions that
involve their direct neighbors. This, in turn, might result
in the co-occurrence of such enzymes and their direct
neighbors in the same bacterial species.

enzyme might become redundant. The mean overlap fraction (see Methods) for such an enzyme should then be
lower than that for enzymes with sparsely-connected
neighborhoods. An appropriate network statistic that
quantifies the extent of interconnection between direct
neighbors of a given node is the clustering coefficient
(CC) [23] (see Methods). We calculated the mean overlap
fraction and the clustering coefficient for each enzyme
and found that these quantities are negatively correlated
for our enzyme network (rβ, CC = -0.32, p ≈ 0, Figure 7a).
To see the relationship more clearly, we grouped enzymes
according to their CC values, and for each group we calculated the averaged mean overlap fraction and the averaged
CC. We found a more evident relationship between the
mean overlap fraction and the clustering coefficient (rCC, β
= -0.97, p = 0.002, Figure 7b). This demonstrates that
enzymes in a densely-connected neighborhood (i.e. high
CC) tend to have low overlap fractions. Moreover, we
found that phylogenetic profile is also negatively correlated with the clustering coefficient (rF, CC = -0.16, p ≈ 0)
and positively with the mean overlap fraction (rF, β = 0.77,
p ≈ 0). Thus, there is evidence to support the idea that frequently-occurring enzymes are probably embedded in a
sparsely-connected neighborhood and are not so redundant in the enzyme network. Furthermore, we found that
betweenness centrality is negatively correlated with clustering coefficient (rB, CC = -0.48, p ≈ 0) and positively with
mean overlap fraction (rB, β = 0.23, p ≈ 0). In contrast,
closeness centrality shows little correlation with either of
these quantities (rC, CC = -0.075, p = 0.019; rC, β = 0.12, p ≈

Factors influencing the correlations between phylogenetic
profile and topological importance
From our findings, we have identified a link between the
topological properties of enzymes in a network and the
frequency with which these enzymes occur among bacterial species. There are correlations between phylogenetic
profile and different measures of topological importance.
Our study was based on an enzyme network constructed
from all known enzyme-enzyme relations in 288 bacterial
species, but the results might be changed by so far undiscovered enzyme-enzyme relations as well as by unexamined bacterial species. Many bacteria are obligate
intracellular parasites or symbionts that can acquire
enzymes and metabolites, such as those involved in
amino acid metabolism, directly from their hosts [15].
Therefore, whether a bacterial species has a particular
enzyme also depends on the environment in which it
lives. There are other factors that explain or influence the
links between phylogenetic profile of enzymes and different measures of topological importance, and we discuss
them next.

Light et al. [15] suggest preferential attachment as a mechanism for the evolution of metabolic and enzyme networks. Preferential attachment means that new nodes
attach to a growing network by connecting to nodes with
existing high connectivity. Nodes with high connectivity
are therefore often those that have been in the network for
a very long time. Thus, enzymes appearing in the early
stages of evolution tend to be found more frequently in
different organisms (e.g. those involved in glycolysis) and
that much of the metabolism of current species is based
on the products of those enzymes [15]. This implies that
evolutionarily early enzymes tend to have more connectivity to other enzymes or metabolites [15]. This is consistent with our findings that enzymes with high
phylogenetic profile tend to have high degree. An example
is pyruvate kinase, which appears in several domains of
organisms (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea); its product,
pyruvate, is an important metabolite for several pathways.
In our enzyme network, 224 out of 288 bacterial species
have pyruvate kinase; it is the third most well-connected
enzyme with a degree of 54.

There are two models for the evolution of enzymes. The
first is the retrograde model, in which new enzymes
evolve from older and related ones in response to the
depletion of substrates in the environment [24]. The second is the patchwork model, which states that evolutionarily early enzyme tend to have broad specificity and so
catalyze reactions with many different metabolites [25].
Both models can account for different aspects of metabolic evolution, and the patchwork model has recently
been discussed as a major driver of enzyme evolution
[14]. Patchwork models suggest that genes coding for
enzymes duplicate or mutate over time to produce different variants with specific catalytic activities. Thus, ancient
enzymes in different organisms tend to have more connectivity than those more recently evolved. However,
degree is not always a good indicator of how many bacterial species have a particular enzyme. Bacteria often adjust
their metabolism depending on their environments and
acquire new enzymes via horizontal gene transfer. Light et
al. [15] suggest that enzymes obtained via horizontal gene
transfer are more likely to be retained by an organism if
they are in a central position or are connected to several
parts of a metabolic network. Thus, some high degree
enzymes in a network may have been acquired recently
via horizontal gene transfer, not from the evolution
within a phylogeny [15]. High degree enzymes acquired
via horizontal gene transfer might therefore appear in
fewer species than those evolved within a phylogeny. This
might in turn explain why high degree enzymes are not
necessarily the most frequently-occurring among bacterial
species (i.e. high phylogenetic profiles). An example is the
enzyme involved in lactose utilization in Escherichia coli.
Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli are closely-related
species, the latter having evolved from the former. One
difference between them is that E. coli can utilize lactose
whereas S. enterica cannot. Lawrence and Ochman [26]
suggest that the lac gene that confers the ability to utilize
lactose on E. coli was probably acquired via horizontal
gene transfer. From the KEGG database, we found that lac
codes for the enzyme beta-galactosidase, which is indeed
present in E. coli but absent from S. enterica. Our results
show that beta galactosidase ranks 194 by degree and 54
by betweenness centrality out of 1081 enzymes (i.e. it
occupies a reasonably central position in the enzyme network), though it is found in only 64 out of 288 species.
Enzymes with many connections are more likely to be on
the shortest paths between any other two enzymes. Therefore, enzymes with higher betweenness also tend to exist
in many different bacterial species. It has been suggested
that metabolic networks are organized compactly such
that one metabolite can be converted to another in just a
few reaction steps [5]. Therefore, we expect frequentlyoccurring enzymes to be those that appear on all shortest
paths between any two other enzymes in a network. Our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/121

results show this correlation, though it is far from perfect.
Flux balance analysis [27], which concerns the dynamics
and stoichiometry of metabolic reactions, has shown that
the metabolism of an organism does not necessarily follow the shortest paths in order to optimize its metabolic
output. Instead of converting a metabolite into another in
one single step, several metabolic pathways are known to
comprise step-by-step changes of one metabolite into
another, involving many intermediates that are precursors
for other pathways [1]. An example is the citric acid cycle.
Although citrate can be converted directly to oxaloacetate
by the enzyme citrase, cells harbor a chain of successive
reactions converting citrate into oxalacetate via several
intermediate metabolites. One of these intermediates is 2oxoglutarate which serves as a precursor in lysine biosynthesis. The enzyme that produces it, isocitrate dehydrogenase, is found in more bacterial species than citrase
although it has a lower betweenness centrality. Therefore,
enzymes involved in longer metabolic pathways can be as
important as those on the shortest ones. Furthermore,
metabolic networks often contain alternative pathways
for interconverting metabolites [28]. This characteristic
makes metabolic networks robust against errors, because
the disruption due to the absence of one enzyme can be
compensated by others [29]. Using elementary-mode
analysis and experimental data, Stelling et al. [29] successfully predicted that an organism can still survive when an
enzyme is removed from a metabolic network, as long as
there are other routes that ensure undisrupted conversions of substrates into the final products that contribute
to cellular growth. Thus, characteristics such as the robustness and redundancy of a metabolic network can provide
opportunities for organisms to survive when there are
faults in their enzyme-encoding genes. It is therefore possible that some enzymes, although not so important in
terms of betweenness centrality (by not being on many of
the shortest paths between any two enzymes), are still to
be found in many different bacterial species where they
ensure continued function despite faults and damages in
their metabolic networks. Although we did not investigate
the issue of robustness of our enzyme network against
errors or nodal deletions, we found that it resembles a
scale-free network with a power-law distribution; and a
feature of scale-free networks is a tendency not to disintegrate into isolated parts when there are accidental nodal
failures [3,8].
Finally, our results suggest that there is little relationship
between phylogenetic profile and closeness centrality. The
weakness of this relationship may reflect network modularity. Metabolic networks consist of functional modules
such as carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid synthesis
and energy metabolism. Some functional modules are
located more centrally than others [2]. The consequence is
that some enzymes occupy a less central position in the

network despite the importance of the functional module
to which they belong. Thus, closeness centrality might be
a poor predictor of phylogenetic profile. An example is the
enzyme DXP-synthase, which converts D-glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate and pyruvate a into 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5phosphate in steroid biosynthesis. Steroid biosynthesis is
a part of lipid metabolism located less centrally in the
metabolic network. This results in the enzyme DXP-synthase being distant from others in the enzyme network
despite being found in more than half of all bacterial species (183 out of 288) on the KEGG database.
The effect of sampling bias on the correlation between
phylogenetic profile and measures of topological
importance
In the KEGG database, many bacterial genera such as
Escherichia and Streptococcus are represented by many species. This might introduce bias into the phylogenetic profile of different enzymes, since some genera are more
highly represented than others. To investigate the effect of
such a bias on our results, we determined the phylogenetic profile using information on the genus level, and
tested the correlations between the revised phylogenetic
profile and each measure of topological importance.
Again, the F-B and F-D correlations were positive and that
of F-C slightly negative: the strongest correlation is
between F and B (rF, B = 0.36, p ≈ 0), followed by that
between F and D (rF, D = 0.31, p ≈ 0) and lastly, that
between F and C (rF, C = -0.07, p = 0.0285). Therefore, sampling bias in the phylogenetic profile does not have a significant effect on the results.

We also investigated the effect of the presence of eukaryotic species on the relationship between phylogenetic profile and each measure of topological importance. There

are 32 eukaryotic species on the KEGG database, and we
added all enzyme-enzyme relations found in them to the
original bacterial enzyme network and then determined
the phylogenetic profile for each enzyme. Again, we found
the strongest correlation between F and B (rF, B = 0.38, p ≈
0), followed by that between F and D (rF, D = 0.34, p ≈ 0),
with the correlation between F and C being relatively
weak (rF, C = -0.097, p = 0.0005). Since differences between
bacterial and eukaryotic metabolism can be great, this
consistency in our results is surprising. It could be due to
the relatively small number of eukaryotic species involved
in our study; their presence may not have changed the
results qualitatively.
Comparison of enzyme networks from different databases
The enzyme network we constructed from the KEGG database consists of enzyme-enzyme relations defined by successive reactions that can be mapped to specific metabolic
pathways. Enzymes are involved in biochemical reactions,
and an alternative enzyme network can also be constructed if a link between two enzymes is defined when
compounds are shared between their respective reactions
[10]. For convenience, we refer such an enzyme network
as an enzyme chemical compatibility network [10]. Such
a network could contain links that do not exist in real life,
or links that do exist but are yet to be identified. Co-factors
are molecules and ions that are required for the proper
functioning of enzymes, and studies on genetic perturbation in yeast have demonstrated their functional importance in cellular metabolism [9]. Cofactors such as NAD,
ATP and water take part in many biochemical reactions, so
enzymes involved in different parts of a metabolic network may be brought close to each other resulting in a different type of enzyme network via those cofactormediated relationships. Enzyme-enzyme relations

brought about via cofactor mediation are not included in
the KEGG database. The resulting enzyme network without cofactors is, in essence, based on reactions that form
the carbon and nitrogen-flow skeleton in metabolism. In
this section, we will investigate whether our findings
about the relationships between phylogenetic profile and
each measure of topological importance still hold for an
enzyme chemical compatibility network where cofactormediated relationships are also considered.
To construct an enzyme chemical compatibility network,
we extracted information on bacterial species from the
BioCyc database [18]. An enzyme-enzyme relation is
defined between enzymes A and B if at least one of the
compounds in the reaction catalyzed by A is also a compound in the reaction catalyzed by B. As before, we also
determined the phylogenetic profile of enzymes. We
found the strongest correlation between F and B (rF, B =
0.14, p ≈ 0), though it was not as strong as those obtained
using the KEGG database. Furthermore, we found no statistically significant correlation between F and D (rF, D = 0.008, p = 0.74), and as before, no correlation between F
and C (rF, C = -0.004, p = 0.86). This was expected since the
enzyme chemical compatibility network constructed here
also includes enzyme-enzyme relations mediated by
cofactors. This is because cofactors participate in many
different biochemical reactions, making enzymes in such

a network well-connected to each other. This homogenizes the topological importance of different enzymes in
a network, decreasing the correlations between the phylogenetic profile and the three measures of topological
importance. Cofactors are difficult to define, nonetheless,
we next removed some common ones such as NAD, ATP,
water, inorganic compounds and ions from the analysis
and found better correlations between phylogenetic profile and the measures of topological importance (rF, B =
0.21, p ≈ 0; rF, D = 0.07, p = 0.003; rF, C = -0.1, p ≈ 0). We
speculate that if we had removed all the cofactors and all
the enzyme-enzyme relations that cannot be mapped to
metabolic pathways, then the results would have been
similar to those obtained using the KEGG database. To
test our intuition, we performed further correlation tests
between phylogenetic profile obtained from the BioCyc
database and each measure of topological importance
determined from the enzyme network constructed using
the KEGG database (since the original enzyme network
only has enzyme-enzyme relations that can be mapped to
metabolic pathways and does not consider cofactor mediation). We found that the correlations of phylogenetic
profile with degree and betweenness centrality were more
evident than with closeness centrality (rF, D = 0.29, p ≈ 0;
rF, B = 0.26, p ≈ 0; rF, C = -0.07 p = 0.022).
We also constructed an enzyme network for a well-studied
bacterial species, Escherichia coli K12, from the KEGG database, and its chemical compatibility counterpart from the
BioCyc database. The network constructed from the
KEGG database has 609 nodes and 1392 links (an average
of 2 links per node), and its counterpart from the BioCyc
database has 729 enzymes and 51630 links (an average of
70 links per node). The much higher number of links per
node in the enzyme chemical compatibility network is
due to the presence of cofactors and nonexistent enzymeenzyme relations. The degree or connectivity distribution
of the enzyme network from the KEGG database can be
fitted with a power law distribution with an estimated
exponent γ = 1.55 (r2 = 0.75). As for the enzyme chemical
compatibility network, its degree distribution was poorly
fitted by a power law (γ = 0.24, r2 = 0.11), but when some
common cofactors were removed from the analysis the fit
improved (γ = 0.73, r2 = 0.46).
Co-factors are essential components in many enzyme-catalytic reactions; and the same co-factors can participate in
many different reactions. They can thus be considered to
bring together enzymes in different metabolic pathways.
Including co-factors in our analysis also produces a highly
connected enzyme network where there is little difference
in the topological importance between nodes. When cofactors are excluded, we see an enzyme network with a
connectivity structure similar to the scale-free networks.
All in all, our findings suggest that the connectivity struc-

enzymes are divided into 11 groups according to their CC. The first group includes enzymes with CC exactly equal to zero. The
second group includes enzymes whose CC fall within the interval (0, 0.1], the third group is for enzymes with CC in the interval

ture of an enzyme network and the relationship between
phylogenetic profile and measures of topological importance are profoundly dependent on the presence of cofactors. Whether or not to include co-factors in studies of
similar types is open to debate as a chemical compatibility
network is bound to include enzyme-enzyme relations
that cannot physically occur within cells, and an enzymenetwork without co-factors might miss some potential
links. We suggest that future studies should investigate
both cases with and without co-factors as reality is likely
to fall somewhere in between.
The effect of missing enzymes on the correlation between
phylogenetic profile and topological importance
A limitation of our analysis is that only a few bacterial species in the KEGG database are fully annotated. Therefore,
the phylogenetic profile obtained might be biased, since
the database might lack some enzymes for some species.
We pooled the data from the KEGG and the BioCyc databases and re-determined the phylogenetic profile for each
enzyme. For a given enzyme, this revised profile will
include bacterial species absent from the former database
but present in the latter. We tested the correlations
between this revised phylogenetic profile and each measure of topological importance calculated from the enzyme
network constructed from the KEGG database. We found
that the revised phylogenetic profile correlated more evidently with degree and betweenness centrality than with

closeness centrality (rF, D = 0.33, p ≈ 0; rF, B = 0.34, p ≈ 0; rF,
C = -0.08, p = 0.0102). Therefore, including bacterial species that might be absent from the KEGG database in the
phylogenetic profile has little effect on our results. However, we are also aware that even in the pooled dataset, the
phylogenetic profile for a given enzyme will not include
all the bacterial species that contain it.

Conclusion
In this study, we have established a link between different
measures of topological importance and the likelihood
that an enzyme will occur in different bacterial species.
Our results suggest that betweenness centrality and degree
predict the phylogenetic profile of an enzyme better than
does closeness centrality. Our findings here are based on
simple assumptions and many biological details have
been ignored. Among these are the obvious ones that
enzyme relationships are often directional and that
metabolism works dynamically [30]. Furthermore, some
parts of the network only exist under certain conditions
because prokaryotic metabolism is characteristically
determined by the environment [31]. Nevertheless, simple topological properties are still informative about the
probable phylogenetic profile of an enzyme. Enzymes
that have high connectivity, or play central and less redundant roles in the conversion of metabolites, are topologically more important and should occur in the majority of
bacterial species.

Methods
Construction of the enzyme network
We constructed an enzyme network by combining information about all enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions in
all 288 bacterial species in the KEGG database for 29
November 2005 [2]. This database is currently the best
available for examining metabolic pathways. Bacteria
were chosen for three reasons. First, bacterial metabolism
is reasonably well understood and this allows us to identify the roles of enzymes more reliably. Second, bacteria
are the largest phylogenetically limited group of species in
the database, allowing good estimates to be made of the
phylogenetic profile and overall topological positions of
individual enzymes. Finally, limiting the investigation to
a single group of organisms removes the confusion that
might arise if representatives of several major organism
types were examined, since each major group is likely to
have metabolic characteristics peculiar to itself.

From the KEGG database, we first determined the number
of different enzymes (identified by EC numbers) occurring in the different bacterial species. The number of species with a given enzyme was also determined, and we
defined this number as the phylogenetic profile Fi of
enzyme i [17]. We defined an undirected link between
two enzymes that participate in two successive reactions
such that the product of one is the substrate of the other
(Figure 1). The network thus constructed contains all
known enzyme-enzyme relations for all bacterial species
in the KEGG database.
We also extracted information on bacterial species from
the BioCyc database [18] to construct an enzyme chemical
compatibility network. As above, we also determined the
phylogenetic profile of each enzyme. What is different
here is the definition of an enzyme-enzyme relation. Here,
an enzyme-enzyme relation is defined between enzymes
A and B if at least one of the compounds in the reaction
catalyzed by A is also a compound in the reaction catalyzed by B. Such an enzyme chemical compatibility network may contain links that cannot be mapped to
metabolic pathways, or links that do exist but are yet to be
identified.
Expected phylogenetic profiles of enzymes
To test the null hypothesis that enzymes are randomly distributed among bacterial species we compared the
expected rank abundance distribution with that observed
in the data (Figure 3). For the expected distribution, we
define ψij as the occurrence of enzyme i in species j, where
i ∈ Δ = {1,2,3,...1081} because there are 1081 enzymes
and j ∈ Γ = {1,2,3,...288} because there are 288 bacterial
species. Summing the occurrences of different enzymes
gives a total of 82171 occurrences (i.e. ψij). For each ψij, i
and j were sampled randomly from Δ and Γ respectively

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/121

so that each combination of ij was unique. We then
counted how many times enzyme i occurs (ψij) and thus
determined its hypothetical phylogenetic profile (Hi). The
values of Hi were then ranked to give the expected rank
distribution. This procedure was simulated 1000 times, so
the expected phylogenetic profile of each rank position is
the average of the 1000 simulations.
Topological measures of importance
Centrality is a network measure of nodal importance
quantifying how prominent a node is relative to others
[19]. We employed three simple indices with different
emphases; together, they provide the greatest amount of
node-specific information [19-22]. Degree (Di) is the
number of direct neighbors of a given node i. Closeness
centrality (Ci) measures how close a node i is to all others
in the same network [20,21]:

Ci =

N

∑

j =1,i ≠ j

dij ,

where dij is the shortest distance between nodes i and j,
and N is the number of nodes in the network. Betweenness centrality (Bi) measures how frequently a node i is
incident to all shortest paths between two other nodes in
the same network [20,22]:

Bi =

∑ g jk (i)/ g jk ,
j >k

where i ≠ j, k; gjk is the number of equally shortest paths
between nodes j and k; and gjk(i) is the number of these
shortest paths to which node i is incident.
A node with high Di might be important since it has many
direct connections with others in the same network. A
node with small Ci might also be important simply
because its influence can reach others rapidly and efficiently. Nodes with high Bi are important because they
mediate many interactions between other nodes. We
examined the relationships between the phylogenetic profile and each of the three measures of topological importance by calculating their Spearman rank correlation
coefficients.
Overlap fractions
The overlap fraction (βi, jk) between a given enzyme i and
one pair of its direct neighbors j and k is defined as the
ratio of the number of bacterial species having enzymes i,
j and k to the number of bacterial species having enzymes
j and k but not i.

If enzyme i has Mi direct neighbors, then there will be (Mi2
- Mi)/2 neighbor pairs and therefore (Mi2 - Mi)/2 overlap

fractions. Thus, for a given enzyme i, we define βi as the
mean overlap fraction:

⎛
β i = ⎜ ∑ β i,ij
⎜ j<k

⎟ / Pi ,

⎠

where Pi is the number of neighbor pairs of enzyme i.
Clustering coefficient
The clustering coefficient of a node i(CCi) is defined as
[23]:

CCi = Qi/Ri,

where Qi is the number of existing links between direct
neighbors of node i, and Ri is the number of possible links
between those direct neighbors. Ri is defined as (Mi2 - Mi)/
2, where Mi is the number of direct neighbors of node i.
Thus, CCi measures how densely connected a node's direct
neighbors are. If CCi = 1 then all its direct neighbors are
connected to each other; if CCi = 0 then none of its direct
neighbors are connected to each other.

Statistical test
Throughout the paper, the Spearman rank correlation test
was used to determine the correlation between two variables x and y and its statistical significance. The null
hypothesis is that x and y are uncorrelated (i.e. their Spearman coefficient of rank correlation is 0), and the p-value
is an estimate of the probability that the null hypothesis
were true. The statistical tests were performed using SPlus.
