Abstract
Background: The genomes of the three parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei
and Leishmania major are the main subject of this study. These parasites are responsible for
devastating human diseases known as Chagas disease, African sleeping sickness and cutaneous
Leishmaniasis, respectively, that affect millions of people in the developing world. The prevalence
of these neglected diseases results from a combination of poverty, inadequate prevention and
difficult treatment. Protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism of controlling the
development of these kinetoplastids. With the aim to further our knowledge of the biology of these
organisms we present a characterisation of the phosphatase complement (phosphatome) of the
three parasites.
Results: An ontology-based scan of the three genomes was used to identify 86 phosphatase
catalytic domains in T. cruzi, 78 in T. brucei, and 88 in L. major. We found interesting differences with
other eukaryotic genomes, such as the low proportion of tyrosine phosphatases and the expansion
of the serine/threonine phosphatase family. Additionally, a large number of atypical protein
phosphatases were identified in these species, representing more than one third of the total
phosphatase complement. Most of the atypical phosphatases belong to the dual-specificity
phosphatase (DSP) family and show considerable divergence from classic DSPs in both the domain
organisation and sequence features.
Conclusion: The analysis of the phosphatome of the three kinetoplastids indicates that they
possess orthologues to many of the phosphatases reported in other eukaryotes, including humans.
However, novel domain architectures and unusual combinations of accessory domains, suggest
distinct functional roles for several of the kinetoplastid phosphatases, which await further
experimental exploration. These distinct traits may be exploited in the selection of suitable new
targets for drug development to prevent transmission and spread of the diseases, taking advantage
of the already extensive knowledge on protein phosphatase inhibitors.

Background
The parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major are the causative agents of
human diseases known as Chagas disease, African sleeping sickness and cutaneous Leishmaniasis, respectively,
that affect millions of people in developing countries
(Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and
parts of Europe) [1]. A major factor in the prevalence of
these diseases is poverty and lack of medical resources in
areas already afflicted by poor social support and threatened economies. Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent the spread of these diseases and many of the drugs
available for treatment are highly toxic and require hospitalisation. In the past several years, new efforts have polarised the attention of laboratories worldwide to tackle the
control of these neglected diseases. The genome
sequences for these pathogenic kinetoplastids, and
recently for two more Leishmania species, have now been
reported [2-5] representing a major step forward to
expand our understanding of their biology. This information provides a great opportunity to analyse particular
gene families and to compare them with those of the host,
with the aim to identify new targets for pharmaceutical
intervention.
The sequenced kinetoplastid parasites have very different
life cycles. Each parasite uses a different insect as their
transmitting vector and prefers different conditions in
which to survive and reproduce after infecting a human
host. L. major is an intracellular parasite, seeking to invade
macrophages and T. cruzi, also intracellular, invades and
replicates in many cell-types, including macrophages and
fibroblasts. T. brucei is an exclusively extracellular parasite
that resides in the bloodstream of the mammalian host.
As the parasitic life cycle takes these organisms through
widely differing environments, frequent and substantial
adaptive changes are required in many cell processes,
resulting in changes in gene expression, protein levels and
protein modifications [6-8]. A well-documented posttranslational modification is protein phosphorylation,
which exhibits marked changes during development of
these parasites [9,10].
Reversible protein phosphorylation is one of the most
important biological mechanisms for the regulation of
adaptive responses to intra- and extra-cellular signals in
both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Many cellular signalling
pathways are modulated through the antagonistic activities of highly specific protein kinases and protein phosphatases that control a number of processes including
metabolic pathways, cell-cell communication, cell growth
and proliferation and gene transcription. Because of their
essential roles, mutated forms of these proteins are often
involved in disease states in mammals [11-14] or result in
a severe reduction in virulence and infection of patho-

genic bacteria [15-17]. The specific roles of protein phosphatases in unicellular protists, in particular protozoan
parasites like Trypanosomes and Leishmania are less
understood.
Recent work has identified several protein phosphatases
and their roles in regulation of parasite development.
TbPTP1 phosphatase is a master switch in controlling differentiation in T. brucei [18]. In particular, this phosphatase inhibits the transition from the G0-arrested
stumpy form in the blood stream to the procyclic form in
the tsetse fly. TbPTP1 inactivation by genetic or chemical
means releases such inhibition and allows the cells to
progress through differentiation to the procyclic form.
Another protein tyrosine phosphatase, not orthologous to
TbPTP1, has been identified in L. major (LmPTP1) that
allows L. major amastigotes to survive in mice [19]. This
may be an important factor in virulence, enabling the
invading pathogen to survive in a host.
Other phosphatases characterised include PP1 from T.
cruzi [20], PP1 and PP2A in T. brucei [21], PP5 in T. brucei
[22] and protein phosphatases with EF-Hands (PPEF) in
T. cruzi, T. brucei and L. major [23], each with various roles
in the biology and development of kinetoplastids. All this
work highlights the importance of protein phosphatases
in the regulation of essential developmental aspects in the
life cycle of pathogenic kinetoplastids.
Protein phosphatases are traditionally classified according
to their substrate preferences, including serine/threonine
phosphatases (STP), tyrosine-specific phosphatases
(PTP), dual-specificity phosphatases (DSP), that dephosphorylate phospho-serine, phospho-threonine and phospho-tyrosine substrates, lipid phosphatases (PTEN type
and Myotubularins), and the low molecular weight PTP
(LMW-PTP). The presence of specific conserved motifs in
the catalytic domain as well as additional regulatory or
targeting domains allow these types to be recognised and
classified into different subfamilies [24-27]. We have
applied this knowledge on domain architecture and conserved catalytic motifs as the basis for the phosphatase
domain classification.
A recent study of the TriTryp kinome [28] provides an
overview of the kinase complement in the three parasites,
and highlights important traits in the distribution of the
different families of kinases. For a full understanding of
phosphorylation-mediated events we also require knowledge of their counterpart protein phosphatases. We
describe in this work the protein phosphatase complements of the TriTryp genomes. We employed an ontologybased classification tool that we have successfully used in
the past to classify phosphatases in the Human and
Aspergillus fumigatus genomes [27] to compile the phos-

phatomes of T. cruzi, T. brucei and L. major. We found that
these organisms have an unusual composition of phosphatases with the PTP family being greatly reduced while
the STP family has expanded by comparison with human
phosphatases. We have also identified novel domain
architectures in several phosphatases with potentially new
functions and a number of unique and atypical phosphatases. With less than 30 phosphatases characterised in
kinetoplastids out of more than 250, the information contained in the TriTryp phosphatome should stimulate further experimentation that would lead to a much more
complete understanding on the biology of these important parasites. The significant divergence from human
phosphatases indicates that these enzymes may be suitable targets for the development of specific inhibitors with
therapeutic applications.

Results and discussion
The TriTryp phosphatome
Following the ontology classification, a total of 252 protein phosphatases were identified: 86 in T. cruzi, 78 in T.
brucei and 88 in L. major (full list in Additional file 1).
Overall there is a great deal of similarity across the three
genomes regarding the number of phosphatases of each
type (Figure 1, Table 1). The three kinetoplastids have representatives from all the major families of phosphatases:
STPs, PTPs, DSPs and the lipid phosphatases PTEN and
Myotubularins. Missing genes include the low molecular
weight PTP (LMW-PTP) and the eyes absent (EYA) phosphatase. Consistent with the evolutionary divergence of
kinetoplastid parasites, a high proportion of phosphatases were identified that have no clear orthologues in
other genomes reported to date. We found that atypical
and kinetoplastid-specific phosphatases amount to 36%
for T. cruzi, 39% for T. brucei and a 41% for L. major of the
total of phosphatases, most of them belonging to the STP
and DSP subfamilies (Table 1).

The proportion of each subfamily of phosphatases is also
significantly different from the human, S. cerevisiae and
plant phosphatome (Figure 1). The most striking feature
is the small proportion of PTPs present in the TriTryp
phosphatome. This resembles only that of the plant A.
thaliana. Whereas in humans and S. cerevisiae, PTPs comprise 31% and 16%, respectively of their phosphatase
complement, A. thaliana and the kinetoplastids have a
very small proportion: 2% for A. thaliana (2 proteins),
2.3% for T. cruzi (2 proteins), 2.6% for T. brucei (2 proteins) and 3.4% for L. major (3 proteins). When the proportion of STPs is analysed, there are also significant
differences to the other species. T. cruzi has 65%, T. brucei, 69%, L. major, 66%, S. cerevisiae, 61% and A. thaliana
81%, whereas the human genome only has 24%. The DSP
family proportion in the kinetoplastids is similar to
humans and S. cerevisiae: T. cruzi has 23% DSPs, T. bru-

cei, 24% and L. major, 25% compared with 31% for the
human DSPs and 18% in S. cerevisiae. T. cruzi has a
higher proportion of PTEN and myotubularin phosphatases compared to the other two parasites, with 3 more
PTEN sequences than L. major and 4 more than T. brucei.
The low proportion of PTPs, together with the large proportion of STPs and of atypical and kinetoplastid-specific
phosphatases, suggests that phosphorylation-mediated
mechanisms in these parasites may have a different
emphasis than in vertebrates. It is interesting that the
extremely low proportion of PTPs seems to be compensated by an expansion of the STP family. This may be
related to the absence of tyrosine-specific kinases encoded

in the kinetoplastid genomes [28] whose activity may be
replaced by dual-specificity protein kinases. Overall it
seems that there is still much to uncover about the functions of phosphatases in organisms distantly related to the
mammalian model, traditionally accepted as the standard.
Protein tyrosine phosphatases
PTPs contain single polypeptide chains that form the catalytic domain and they are usually decorated with accessory subdomains (for example, SH2, Rhodanese, Ig, FN)
critical for specific regulation or subcellular location
[25,29]. PTPs are recognised by a highly conserved activesite motif, CX5R, necessary for a Cys-based mechanism of
catalysis, assisted by a conserved Asp residue. The rest of
the catalytic domain differs significantly between subfamilies. In addition to the classical PTPs a number of
atypical phosphatases exist that lack catalytic activity
(STYX or pseudophosphatases) [30]. All TriTryp PTPs
identified have a single PTP domain (Figure 2) with the
conserved active-site motif, CX5R, but with no extracellular regions or trans-membrane regions predicted, and
without any additional recognisable regulatory or targeting domains commonly found in human PTPs. A

nance of the three-dimensional fold characteristic of PTPs
[25]. Group 1 contains the sequences that are the most
similar to human phosphatase domains. A member of
this group is present in L. major (LmPTP1) with an orthologous syntenic gene in T. cruzi (TcPTP1) (see Additional
file 3). However, T. brucei lacks an orthologue of this protein, suggesting that it may have a role in intracellular
parasitism. This is consistent with recent functional analysis of LmPTP1 demonstrating reduced virulence of amastigote forms upon genetic ablation [19]. Group 2 contains
three proteins, TbPTP1, LmPTP2 and TcPTP2 (Note that,
despite the nomenclature, TbPTP1 is not the orthologue
of TcPTP1 and LmPTP1). We have recently characterised
TbPTP1 as a tyrosine specific PTP with a critical role in
controlling T. brucei differentiation [18]. These Group 2
PTPs lack motif 2 (DX2RVXL) in the phosphatase domain
and contain up to six kinetoplastid-specific regions in
both the pre-catalytic and catalytic domain of the protein.
Distinct specific motifs are also found in Group 1 PTPs
with slight sequence variations (see Additional file 4). The
function of these regions is unknown but may be potentially important in substrate recognition or regulation.
Group 3 (kinetoplastid-specific PTPs, kPTPs) sequences
show the most interesting variations of the PTP domain
with substitutions in most motifs and a deletion between
motifs 7 and 8. Substitutions were detected in the structural motifs (motifs 2–7) of five hydrophobic residuesrequired for core stability-, by hydrophilic and basic residues. Altogether, these changes may have a considerable
effect on the stability of the PTP domain and perhaps this
is compensated by alternative folding arrangements or
local conformational adjustments. These may become
clear once structural information on these enzymes is
available. Phylogenetic analysis of the PTP sequences (Figure 3) confirms the presence of three clades, which are distantly related to human, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana PTPs.
Because the analysis of the TriTryp kinome revealed that
these organisms do not have tyrosine kinases, determining the exact roles of the uncharacterised PTPs has become
more important, given their potential role in the regulation of parasite biology. Our analysis did not identify any
potential receptor PTPs, which is consistent with the lack
of receptor tyrosine kinases. The sequence differences
described above and the low homology to human PTPs
suggest that these phosphatases may be suitable targets for
the design of specific and selective inhibitors against parasitic infection and transmission.
Dual-specificity phosphatases
TriTryp DSPs show a large variety of domain architectures,
some of them completely novel when compared to DSPs
in other organisms (Figure 2). Sequence analysis of the
type 2 DSP domains in the TriTryp genomes shows a
group of parasite proteins with clear matches to classic

cruzi, has been characterised and it was found to be farnesylated at the C-terminus and to localise to endocytic
membranes [37]. The functional role of this protein in
trypanosomes is still unclear.
Atypical DSPs (aDSPs)
The majority of TriTryp DSPs show significant differences
to classic DSPs, and have either unusual domain organisations (Figure 2), or are lacking conservation of sequence
features in their catalytic domain (see Additional file 5),
we refer to this group as atypical DSPs (aDSPs). In the first
category, we found three subfamilies of phosphatases

with unusual domain organisation: 1) a catalytic DSP
domain with additional Leucine Rich Repeats (LRRs)
(types 4 and 5 in Figure 2); 2) a DSP domain with two
pseudokinase domains (see below) and LRRs (types 6 and
7, Figure 2), we named this subfamily kinatases (from
kinase and phosphatase); and 3) a DSP domain with an
ankyrin domain. The presence of LRRs in a phosphatase
sequence is very unusual. Related examples are only
found in A. thaliana, which contains a large family of
receptor protein kinases with LRRs [38] and also in some
human kinases, for example, LRRK1 [39]. The only other
example of a phosphatase with LRRs is the human protein
PHLPP, which dephosphorylates Akt and promotes apoptosis [40]. This protein contains LRRs with a protein phos-

phatase 2C domain. No sequences have been reported to
date containing both LRRs and DSP domains or kinase
domains with LRRs and DSP domains, making these
domain organisations unique to the kinetoplastids.
The LRR regions from each of the kinetoplastid sequences
were investigated using sequence similarity searching.
Interestingly, the LRRs in the kinatase group have homology to LRR modules in SHOC2/SUR-8 [41]. The LRRDSPs match SHOC-2, or Soc-2 proteins, but the E-values
for all the matches are much higher (>0.001). SHOC2 is a
Ras-binding scaffold protein that enhances Ras-MAP
kinase signal transduction by facilitating the interaction
between Ras and Raf [42]. Other matches include a
human sequence (Q9Y4C4_HUMAN, TrEMBL database)
annotated as "Malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified
sequence", which contains a Ras GTPase domain, and
plant intracellular Ras-group related LRR proteins (PIRLs)
[43], related to Ras-binding proteins in animals and yeast.
All three kinatases and all three LRR-DSPs also have neartop matches to bacterial LRR-containing sequences annotated as small GTP-binding proteins (e.g. Trichodesmium
erythraeum
Q10Y31_TRIEI,
Magnetococcus
A0L4U3_MAGSM,
and
Anabaena
variabilis
Q3MD20_ANAVT). Overall, the kinatases and LRR-DSPs
show similarity to LRR proteins involved in regulation of
Ras-mediated signalling pathways and small GTP-binding
proteins in bacteria, suggesting that they may share similar functional roles in the parasites and act as scaffolding
proteins in signalling pathways.
Analysis of the kinase domains in the kinatases indicates
that they are likely to be enzymatically inactive, and we

refer to them as pseudokinases for consistency with the
previous classification. Comparison to eukaryotic protein
kinases highlights the lack of residues essential for catalytic activity and substrate binding (Figure 5). For example, the glycine triad (GXGXXG) necessary for ATP
binding is only present in one of the T. cruzi kinase
domains, and the catalytic Asp residue in the active site
HRD motif is substituted by other residues in all of the
kinase domains. The first kinase domain in the kinatases
also has substitutions in the magnesium-binding DFG
motif. Although these pseudokinase domains might have
lost the capability to phosphorylate substrates, they may
still perform important regulatory roles in signalling pathways as has been reported for other pseudokinases [44].
The presence of the LRR modules strongly suggests a role
in protein-protein interactions, while the addition of an
active DSP domain and pseudokinase domains hints to a
sophisticated regulatory function, which has not been
reported in higher eukaryotes. A similar domain architecture (kinase + phosphatase) is present in other protozoan
organisms such as Giardia lamblia, Tetrahymena thermophila, and Dictyostelium discoideum, indicating evolutionary conservation of a these proteins. Sequences with
LRRs and DSP domains only, are also present in other
protozoa: Entamoeba histolytica and Dictyostelium discoideum suggesting that this family may be also specific to
protozoa. It will be interesting to further explore the functional relevance of these novel DSPs in kinetoplastid signalling.

involved in transcription initiation, cell cycle regulation
and signalling [45]. There are few examples of PTPs with
Ankyrin domains. One of these is the human protein tyrosine phosphatase PTN20 variant 11 (Q4JDK8_HUMAN).
Others include uncharacterised sequences from C. elegans
and C. briggsae (Q22668_CAEEL and Q628I2_CAEBR).
No DSPs have been reported with ankyrin domains thus
this appears to be a novel domain architecture only
present in T. cruzi.

In a second category of aDSPs, we found a number of
sequences that are particularly different from eukaryotic
DSPs with low homology in one or more functional DSP
motifs, and with amino acid substitutions in the active
site P-loop (see Additional file 5). These sequences can be
grouped into 6 further subgroups. Groups 1, 2 and 3 contain basic residues Arg or Lys in the P-loop signature, a
trait found in PTEN lipid phosphatases, although in the
phylogenetic tree they cluster independently of PTEN. We
refer to them as lipid-like aDSPs (Figure 4 and Table 1).
Group 3 have similar features in the P-loop to the triplespecificity phosphatase MptpB in M. tuberculosis [46].
Groups 4 and 5 lack the catalytic Arg in the P-loop and are
missing either the D-motif or the R-motif. This group clusters around the lipid-like DSPs (aDSP in Figure 4).
Another group (group 6 in Additional file 5) has substitutions of the catalytic Cys residue in the P-loop, a diagnostic of inactive phosphatases, also called STYX
phosphatases. STYX phosphatases are evolutionarily conserved pseudophosphatase modules [30] that, like pseudokinases are enzymatically inactive, but are functionally
important as modulators of phosphorylation-dependent
signalling. Their actions may be implicated in either competitive or cooperative mechanisms of phosphosubstrate
binding and controlling subcellular location as reported
for STYX and inactive myotubularins [47,48] and the inactive phosphatase domains of receptor PTPs [49].
MKPs
MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) are critical regulatory
proteins in stress-dependent and hormone-related signalling pathways, and are highly conserved in vertebrates.
However, other eukaryotes, like yeast and plants, have distinct MKPs apparently unrelated to the vertebrate analogues [50-53]. There are no obvious orthologues of
human MKPs in kinetoplastids. Instead, a number of
sequences were found to have close homology to reported
MKP phosphatases in Arabidopsis (AtMKP1, AtDSPTP1).
This is supported both by blast searches and clustering in
the phylogenetic tree (Figure 6). These sequences segregate into two groups in the tree (Figure 6), one of them
includes the atypical DSPs with LRR motifs and the kinatases. The other group clusters with AtMKP1. One
sequence in the second group, Tc00.1047053509099.20,

has a KIM-like motif (kinase interacting motif) [54],
although it does not contain the remaining motifs, found
in classic MKPs [53] and shared with different MAP kinase
(MAPK) effectors [55], or the rhodanese domain found in
human MKPs. Furthermore, the close resemblance to
plant MKPs highlights their divergence from the mammalian genes. The interesting combination with protein
interacting modules, like LRR (discussed above) and pseudokinase domains, suggests a role in the regulation of signalling pathways, likely of the Ras-dependant MAPK type.
There are a total of 42 protein kinases in the T. brucei, T.
cruzi and L. major, which are thought to be regulated as
MAPKs [28] and it is possible that the aDSP-MKPs identified here play a role in their regulation.

Kinetoplastid-specific DSPs (kDSP)
A significant number of sequences in the DSP family share
most of the classic DSP motifs, although they have no
clear homology to any reported DSP and so they appear to
be kinetoplastid-specific (Table 1, Figure 4). To determine
kDSP function, further experimental characterisation will
be needed.
Special features and accessory domains
A feature of the kinetoplastid DSPs is that most of them,
including the eDSPs, are significantly longer than human
DSPs. The same is true for several kinases, in particular
MAPKs [56,57]. A calculation of the average human DSP
length gave 392aa whereas the figures for the kinetoplastids were: T. cruzi, 501aa; T. brucei, 519aa; and L.
major, 700aa. Many of the parasite DSPs, have either N- or
C- terminal extensions, some of them with no significant
matches (E-value < 0.01) to annotated proteins such that
no functions for these extra regions can be assigned. Other
extensions contain accessory motifs or domains including
the LRRs, pseudokinase domains and ankyrin domains
previously described. Another example is the presence of
a CAAX box, consisting of a cysteine (C), two aliphatic residues (A, A) and any other amino acid (X) in the PRL
phosphatases. The cysteine directs protein prenylation
important for localisation of the PRLs.

In contrast, some TriTryp DSPs, lack typical accessory
modules found in mammalian genes. Such is the case of
the putative MKPs that lack the kinase-binding rhodanese
domain or CH2 domain [58] in the N-terminal region.
This is also missing in mammalian low molecular weight
MKPs, although they are still capable of dephosphorylating MAPKs. In the kinetoplastid MKPs the presence of
LRRs and pseudokinase domains may replace the specific
binding role of such domains. Thus, the kinetoplastid
PTPs and DSPs seem to have adopted different domain
organisations and strategies to fulfil analogous functions
to mammalian phosphatases. A similar trend was also
observed for protein kinases, which in trypanosomes lack
the same type of accessory domains as their human orthologues. In fact, four of the five most common Pfam
domains in human protein kinases are absent in the
trypanosomatids kinome [28].
Lipid phosphatases (PTEN and myotubularins)
PTEN and myotubularins (MTMs) are DSP phosphatases
with activity against phosphoinositides. This peculiar substrate versatility is crucial to their identified biological
roles in mammals as tumour suppressors (for PTEN), and
as regulators of endosomal trafficking (in the case of
MTMs). Their role in lipid dephosphorylation and membrane targeting may also be important in different aspects
of kinetoplastid metabolism. PTEN-like phosphatases
were identified in the three kinetoplastids (Table 1) with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/434

two different architectures: the first has a DSP domain and
a calcium-binding region at its C-terminus (type 9, Figure
2) and the second contains only the DSP domain (type
10, Figure 2) and shows lower homology to eukaryotic
PTENs. The existence of two types of PTEN phosphatases
is also reflected in the phylogenetic analysis, even when
the DSP domain alone is considered (Figure 7). The type
9 group is closest to human PTEN and contains 4 T. cruzi
and 1 L. major sequence (Figure 7). Interestingly, T. brucei
does not seem to have an orthologue of human PTEN, but
it has a PTEN-like protein similar to the other two parasites.
Two subfamilies of MTMs were identified that possess the
typical domain organisation of MTMs, with a phos-

phatase domain and N-terminal lipid-binding GRAM
domain (type 11, Figure 2), or with and additional PI3P
binding FYVE domain (type 12, Figure 2). Each of the parasites has one sequence of each type. Overall, the six kinetoplastid MTM sequences have high similarity to human
MTMs across the length of the phosphatase domain.
However, they do not individually cluster with any
human MTMs, hence direct orthologues cannot be determined (Figure 7). It is interesting that only two MTM
sequences are present in each of these organisms as this is
one of the largest subfamilies of DSPs in humans (14
genes). Along with the classical types of DSPs, the MTM
family appears to have been substantially expanded in
higher eukaryotes. MTMs, which are relatively large
sequences in humans, are larger still in the kinetoplastids.
Most human MTMs are around 450–700aa with a few
over 1,000aa. The smallest TriTryp MTM is 872aa
(Tb927.1.3300) and the largest is 3,246 aa
(LmjF12.0320) with a long N-terminus extension that has
no predicted domain or motif matches.
Cdc25 and Arc2 reductases
Cdc25 (cell division cycle 25) phosphatases are widely
spread in metazoans and known to be responsible for the
activation of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) [59]. This
is an essential step in progression to mitosis that controls
the G2 to M checkpoint. The kinetoplastid cell cycle is also
regulated by CDK-related kinases (CRKs) [60] and 10–11
CRKs have been identified in the TriTryp kinome [28].
Although modulation of CRK activity is still not well
understood, the presence of other cell cycle regulatory
phosphatases like PP1, PP2A and cdc14 suggest that similar mechanisms may be conserved in kinetoplastids.

In our analysis, two sequences, Tc00.1047053508707.20
and LmjF32.2740, matched the rhodanese-like domain
similar to the cdc25 phosphatase catalytic domain. No
significant match was found in T. brucei (< 0.01). Orthologues of LmjF32.2740 are also present in L. infantum and
L. brazilensis (see Additional file 6).
Rhodanese domains are also found in sulfur-transferases
and in the Acr2 type of arsenate reductases, indicating a
common evolutionary lineage with phosphatases [61,62].
In addition, they all share a similar Cys-based catalytic
mechanism and a conserved CX5R active site motif [61].
In fact, LmjF32.2740 is homologous to eukaryotic arsenate reductases from S. cerevisiae, ScACR2, and Arabidopsis,
AtACR2 (formerly annotated as cdc25). Consistent with
this, LmjF32.2740 (LmACR2) has been found to functionally complement the arsenate-sensitive phenotype of the
ScACR2 deletion in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, it confers
sensitivity to the antimonial drug Pentostam, by virtue of
its antimonial reductase activity in addition to the arsenate reductase activity [63]. Recently, it has been reported

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/434

that purified LmACR2 also exhibits apparent phosphatase
activity in vitro [64]. Tc00.1047053508707.20 remains
uncharacterised, but its similarity to LmACR2 predicts it
may have arsenate reductase activity. Phylogenetic analysis further supports the idea that cdc25-like sequences in
Leishmania and T. cruzi, are more closely related to eukaryotic Acr2 reductases than to mammalian cdc25s (see
Additional file 6). The active site motif of the kinetoplastid sequences is clearly different in composition and
properties to the mammalian cdc25 that have acidic residues (EFSSE), but similar to Acr2s with hydrophobic residues (AXSLV).
The functional role of cdc25 in kinetoplastids, as suggested for plants [65], may be replaced instead by the
activity of B type cyclin-dependent kinases (cdck-B). The
nearest homologues to the cdck-B in Arabidopsis are the
Cdc2-related kinases (CRK1–3, [66]) identified in T. brucei and L. mexicana. These CDKs are critically involved in
cell cycle control mechanisms similarly to Cdc25s in other
eukaryotes [67-69].
LMW-PTPs and ArsC reductases
Three
kinetoplastid
sequences
(Tb09.160.2100,
LmjF01.0200 and Tc00.1047053504797.120) were initially found to match the InterPro LMW-PTP domain
(IPR000106). These sequences were aligned with more
than 250 LMW-PTPs from different organisms and also
with a group of related bacterial arsenate reductases (ArsC
type) for phylogenetic analysis (data not shown). The
prokaryote ArsC reductases are unrelated to eukaryote
Acr2 reductases, and yet they also share the active site Ploop signature motif CX5R with PTPs and have remarkable structural similarity to LMW-PTPs [70]. The kinetoplastid sequences formed a separate cluster in the
phylogenetic tree originating from the same branch as
those of the bacterial ArsC but clearly distinct from the
LMW-PTPs. The phylogram (see Additional file 6) also
shows that cdc25 and Acr2 (yeast, plants and kinetoplastids) are clearly related but distinct from the ArsC
reductases found in bacteria and in kinetoplastids.

The three kinetoplastid ArsC sequences have two conserved long insertions. Interestingly, the kinetoplastid
ArsC sequences lack the catalytic Cys residue in the active
site (substituted by Gly), and the two landmark Cys residues also important in catalysis [71,72]. However, they
contain the catalytic Arg (P-loop) and Asp (general acid in
catalysis) residues. This suggests that they may be inactive
enzymes or that they use an alternative catalytic mechanism.
ArsC homologues are not present in vertebrates or plants,
which use Acr2 instead for metalloid detoxification. It is
intriguing then that T. cruzi and L. major have retained the

bacterial arsenate reductases ArsC in addition to acquiring
the eukaryotic Acr2 and that the Acr2 gene is not present
in T. brucei, – with the syntenic region of the genome in
that parasite instead containing two predicted amino acid
transporter genes (see Additional file 7). Recently, the
presence of two putative ArsC proteins in A. fumigatus has
been reported [73], suggesting that some lower eukaryotes
may require both systems for arsenate reduction.
Serine/threonine phosphatases
STPs are multi-subunit complexes, which combine a catalytic subunit with various regulatory and targeting subunits [26,74] providing selective substrate specificity,
subcellular localisation and regulation of enzymatic activity. STPs share a similar catalytic mechanism and are structurally related, although based on metal ion dependence
and sequence homology they can be divided into three
main subfamilies: PPP, PPM and FCP [26]. The PPP and
PPM subfamilies share structural similarity and a common mechanism of catalysis, with conserved acidic residues that coordinate the metal ions essential for activity.
In humans, a small number of genes encode for STP catalytic domains. Conversely, in C. elegans [75] and Arabidopsis [76], STPs represent between 50–80% of the
phosphatome. We restricted our analysis to the catalytic
phosphatase domains for this class. The STP family of
phosphatases is the largest represented in kinetoplastids
accounting for more than one half of the whole complement of protein phosphatases. Typical domain architectures were identified (Figure 2) containing the conserved
phosphatase catalytic domain either alone or with accessory domains like tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that
mediate protein-protein interactions, found in PP5 or calcium binding EF-hand domains, found in PPEF proteins.
Many kinetoplastid STPs, like the DSPs, are longer proteins than their human relatives, with extensions of
unknown function.
PPP phosphatases
PPP phosphatases PP1 and PP2A are involved in the regulation of a number of signalling pathways, including
MAPK-dependent networks, cell cycle regulation, glycogen metabolism and microtubule organisation at centrosomes [77-81]. The general pattern that identifies
members of the PPP family contains motifs from three
separate regions GDXHG – GDXVDRG – GNHE [82] (residues in bold coordinate metal ions at the catalytic site
and the underlined His is the proton donor in catalysis).

There are clearly identifiable clades in the PPP phylogenetic tree for the PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP4, PP5 and PPEF
phosphatases and these groups are well supported statistically (Figure 8).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/434

Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)
The PP1 group contains a large group of kinetoplastid
sequences: 7 in T. cruzi, 8 in T. brucei and 8 in L. major.
Two of the T. cruzi PP1catalytic subunits (PP1? and PP1?)
have been characterised [20]. Inhibitor studies suggested
that in T. cruzi epimastigotes, PP1 has an important role
in the completion of cell division and in the maintenance
of cell shape [20]. Similar roles were previously proposed
for PP1 in higher eukaryotes [83]. The functional roles of
the T brucei PP1 and PP2A phosphatases have also been
studied [84]. The combined RNAi ablation of 7 PP1s and
the PP2A catalytic subunits in procyclic forms, resulted in
a slow growth phenotype but did not lead to lethality.
This is in contrast with previous experiments in which
trypanosomes treated with okadaic acid (OA), a well
known inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A enzyme activity, show
defects in cytokinesis and organelle genome segregation
(multinuclear cells with single kinetoplast) [85]. The
seemingly conflicting findings of these two reports
(absence of multinucleated cells with RNAi vs. multinucleated cells after okadaic acid treatment) suggests that
additional OA sensitive PPP enzyme activities are present
in T. brucei although incomplete ablation by RNAi might
also be responsible.

Interestingly, 3 PP1c genes in T. cruzi, 4 PP1c genes in T.
brucei and 5 PP1c genes in L. major are found in tandem
gene arrays. In T. brucei the repeat structure of the array is
disrupted through extensive divergence in the flanking
and coding sequences. The gene encoding PP1-7
(Tb927.4.3560) has evolved unique UTRs and is separated from the other 3 members (PP1-6 (Tb927.4.3620),
PP1-5 (Tb927.4.3630) and PP1-4 (Tb927.4.3640)) by the
insertion of two unrelated tandem-arranged genes (each
encoding translational elongation factor 1 beta). This
organisation retains orthology in both T. cruzi and L.
major [86]. Kinetoplastid genes do not generally possess
individual promoters and, therefore, cannot be up-regulated through transcriptional initiation. Instead, where
high transcript levels are required, genes may be duplicated to form tandem gene arrays, which are co-transcribed. The PP1s in the arrays might needed to be
expressed on a certain level, working as "housekeeping
genes" while the other PP1 homologues would be in
charge of the "fine tuning" of various signal transduction
events.
Protein phosphatase 2A and 2B (PP2A and PP2B)
Two groups of PP2A phosphatases were identified for
each parasite. One group is more closely related to
human, S. cerevisiae and plant PP2As than the other (Figure 8). A member of the second group, PP2A from T. cruzi
(Tc00.1047053511021.10), has already been characterised as important for the complete transformation of trypomastigotes into amastigotes during the life cycle of the

Phylogram of the PPP subfamily of serine/threonine phosphatases. Included are TriTryp PPP catalytic domains and
those from human, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana. Phosphatase domains are indicated by systematic gene IDs. Sequences are colour-coded by organism: blue for T. cruzi (Tc), T. brucei (Tb) and L. major (LmjF); red for human (Hs); brown for S. cerevisiae (Sc)
and green for A. thaliana (At). Protein names replace Swiss-Prot IDs for some human, yeast and plant sequences and systematic
IDs for the parasites. Results of the four phylogenetic methods are shown: bootstrap values > 70 are black for Neighbour-Joining, brown for Bayesian and purple for Maximum Parsimony. Asterisks (*) show Maximum Likelihood support. The symbol '+'
marks kinetoplastid sequences with catalytic mutations (listed in Additional file 8).

human, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana. Phosphatase domains are indicated by systematic gene IDs. Sequences are colour-coded by
organism: blue for T. cruzi (Tc), T. brucei (Tb) and L. major (LmjF); red for human (Hs); brown for S. cerevisiae (Sc) and green for
A. thaliana (At). Most sequence IDs are from the Swiss-Prot database but there are also NCBI database accession numbers used
(beginning 'NP'). Results of the four phylogenetic methods are shown: bootstrap values > 70 are black for Neighbour-Joining,
brown for Bayesian and purple for Maximum Parsimony. Asterisks (*) show Maximum Likelihood support. Dashed lines show
phylogenetic relationships as indicated in an initial tree from an ungapped alignment. Each clade was analysed separately to
obtain robust phylogenetic analysis and these were then combined to show the whole PPM family.

parasite [87]. Similarly to PP2A, two groups of PP2B are
present in kinetoplastids. One group clusters with the
human and S. cerevisiae homologues, while the second triplet forms a separate cluster (Figure 8). Sequences in the
second cluster have mutations in catalytic residues suggesting they may be pseudophosphatases.
Protein phosphatase 4 and 6 (PP4 and PP6)
Homologues to human PP4 and PP6 have not yet been
characterised in any of these kinetoplastids. We found a
well-supported PP4 cluster that included a kinetoplastid
triplet together with the human and A. thaliana PP4
sequences (Figure 8). PP6 orthologues were found in T.
cruzi
(Tc00.1047053510687.40)
and
L.
major
(LmjF34.4190) by blast search, but there is apparently no
T. brucei PP6 orthologue.
Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5)
Homologues of PP5 in T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major cluster with human and S. cerevisiae PP5 sequences (Figure 8)
and they all contain tetratricopeptide (TPR) modules (Figure 2). Analysis of the T. brucei PP5 (TbPP5) [22] highlights that the TPRs of this protein are actually similar to
those in fungi. TbPP5 expression is regulated during cell
cycle progression and it is important for normal cell
growth [88].
Protein phosphatases with EF Hands (PPEF)
Close to the PP5 sequences are the protein phosphatases
with EF-hands (PPEF) (or PP7) (Figure 8). Kinetoplastid
PPEF phosphatases are found clustering with human
PPEFs, showing that there are two PPEF proteins in T. cruzi
and T. brucei but only one in L. major. As there are two
human PPEF proteins this suggests either that duplication
of the PPEF gene occurred before kinetoplastids diverged
and that L. major has lost a copy or that two duplication
events occurred independently, in kinetoplastids and during higher eukaryote development. A recent publication
discusses the PPEF family of kinetoplastid phosphatases
[23], showing that these enzymes are N-myristoylated and
constitutively expressed through all parasites life cycle.
Other PPPs
In many eukaryotic organisms there exist "non-conventional" PPPs. These have greater similarity to bacterial
enzymes than to other eukaryotic PPP proteins [89].
Alphs (ApaH-like phosphatases) are a group of eukaryotic
PPPs that have greater similarity to bacterial diadenosine
tetraphosphatases than to other members of the PPP family and several kinetoplastid PPP sequences fall into this
category (see Additional file 8). These Alphs have specific
mutations in the second conserved motif, GDXVDRG, in
particular, the substitution of the second Asp for a neutral
residue and substitution of the Arg for Lys [89]. These

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/434

mutations are found in 3 T. cruzi, 3 T. brucei and 2 L. major
sequences (Additional file 8).
Kinetoplastid-specific PPPs (kPPP)
Several kinetoplastid PPP sequences have amino acid substitutions of catalytically important residues (Additional
file 8). These pseudophosphatases may not be able to
carry out dephosphorylation, although they may still have
kinetoplastid-specific roles. These sequences form part of
a large group of kinetoplastid-specific PPPs (kPPP, Figure
8). The long branch-lengths of several of the proteins in
this group and also the Alphs indicate that these kPPP
sequences have diverged much more over time than the
others. The most interesting aspect of the kPPP group is
that sequence similarity searches show some of these
sequences have greater similarity to plant and fungal
phosphatases, in particular to the BSU1 and BSL types of
A. thaliana phosphatases. BSU1 is a nuclear protein phosphatase that modulates the cell response to plant steroid
hormones [90]. One of these kinetoplastid-specific
sequences, Tb927.6.4630, has previously been identified
as a "Shelph" with similarity to PPP phosphatases from
Shewanella, a psychrophillic bacteria [89]. Another
Shelph exists in L. major, LmjF31.2630 that appears in the
PP1 section of the tree (Figure 8).
PPM phosphatases
Despite differences in their primary sequences, the threedimensional structures of PPP and PPM proteins are very
similar and they share a common catalytic mechanism
[91]. PPM phosphatases depend on Mg2+ or Mn2+ for catalytic activity. A set of 11 conserved motifs has been identified within the PPM/PP2C family of phosphatases [92].
Motifs 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 11 are most conserved in eukaryotes and form the pattern: ED – DGH [AG] – GD – GD –
DG – DN (conserved Asp residues coordinate the metal
ions Mg2+ or Mn2+ essential for catalysis). The analysis of
the PP2C sequences from kinetoplastidsshows that all of
them possess the Asp residues in the motifs above, with
the only exception of Tc00.1047053504163.10,
Tb10.70.1410 and LmjF36.1260, which are missing some
of the acidic residues in the metal binding site. These have
been previously designated as 'PP2C-like' [2] because they
do not possess all of the PP2C motifs.

The TriTryp PPM family is similar to the human as there
are 15 PPMs in human and 14 in T. cruzi, 13 in T. brucei
and 15 in L. major. A. thaliana, however, has a larger
expansion of this family [76] with 63 genes. From the
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 9) we observed that plant
PPM phosphatases, with few exceptions, form distinct
clades separate from human, yeast and kinetoplastid
sequences. Parasite PPMs have greater similarity to
human and yeast sequences, although direct human
homologues are not clear from the tree.

PP2C phosphatases are negative regulators of stress-regulated signalling mediated by PKA and the p38 and JNK
MAPK pathways [93,94] in mammals. In yeast and plants,
PP2C proteins are also involved in modulating stress
response signalling [95-97]. More recently an important
role in cell cycle regulation has been reported for human
PP2C in dephosphorylation of Cdk2 and Cdk6 [98], and
in cell cycle arrest in Xenopus [99]. Other functions of
PP2Cs include the regulation of cytoskeleton organisation
[100] and development [101]. A Leishmania PP2C,
LcPP2C, was shown to be present in both the infective
promastigote and tissue amastigote stages of L. chagasi
and L. amazonensis. The catalytic properties of LcPP2C
were found to be similar to eukaryotic PP2C enzymes
with respect to Mg2+ dependence and insensitivity to the
inhibitor okadaic acid [102].
FCP phosphatases
This family comprises a group of phosphatases that
dephosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of
RNA polymerase II and that interact with transcription
factor TFIIF [103,104]. In yeast, FCP1 is an essential gene
[104]. We found FCP homologues in all three genomes:
13 in T. cruzi, 14 in T. brucei and 13 in L. major matching
human and S. cerevisiae proteins (see Additional File 1).
These phosphatases dephosphorylate serine residues of
the conserved "heptad repeats" YSPTSPS at the CTD of the
polymerase, which is required for recycling of the
polymerase at the end of transcription. T. brucei has an
RNA polymerase II, but this protein lacks the heptad
repeats at its C-terminus, as found in most eukaryotes.
Despite the lack of heptad repeats, the T. brucei RNA
polymerase II is believed to be phosphorylated at alternative sites – perhaps through the C-terminal region which
is rich in serine and tyrosine residues-, that may be targeted by the identified CTD phosphatase homologues
[105,106].

Overall, there is a remarkable expansion of the kinetoplastid STP family in comparison to other eukaryotic
genomes. Importantly, this highlights the prominent role
of serine/threonine phosphorylation in the physiology of
these parasites that overwrites the importance of tyrosine
phosphorylation as reported in mammalian organisms.
This is consistent with the lack of tyrosine kinases [28]
and matches the situation in plants [76].

Conclusion
The fluctuation of protein phosphorylation in kinetoplastids is well documented and in many instances is
clearly related to stage-specific events or cell cycle regulation. As the functional characterisation of protein kinases
is quickly expanding, a better knowledge of the phosphatase complement of these unicellular parasites is
essential to understand the complexity and regulation of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/434

many cellular processes controlled by phosphorylation.
Overall we identified more than 250 protein phosphatase
domains in the three kinetoplastids, which represents
about 50% of the kinase genes and apparently indicates a
lower level of complexity for this type of enzymes. Further
complexity may result from combinations with interacting regulatory subunits, particularly in the STP family or
by stage-specific control of their expression levels.
The analysis of the TriTryp phosphatome provides valuable information for future experimental studies and highlights many interesting differences with other eukaryotic
genomes, such as the low proportion of PTPs and the
expansion of the STP family. Interestingly, a larger
number of atypical protein phosphatases have been identified in these species, comprising approximately one
third of the total. Most of the atypical phosphatases
belong to the DSP family, and show considerable divergence from classic DSPs. Novel domain architectures suggest potential functional roles for the LRR containing
DSPs as scaffolds in cellular events. Many kinetoplastid
phosphatases are longer than human phosphatases and
those extensions may contain unidentified functionalities. Sequence extensions have also been found in PP2
phosphatases in Plasmodium falciparum [107] and in a
large number of proteins from pathogenic microorganisms [108]. It appears that the presence of such extensions
has been conserved through evolution and may have an
important role in pathogenesis.
Between the three kinetoplastids there are interesting differences, potentially related to their different environments and parasitic mode. T. brucei, the only extracellular
pathogen, seems to have distinct traits, with less phosphatase genes than T. cruzi and L. major. Finally, the STP
family appears to be extended in the TriTryp genome in
comparison to humans, maybe to compensate for the
lower number of PTPs. This correlates well with results
from the TriTryp kinome study showing that these parasites are lacking tyrosine specific kinases. Overall, a
number of important differences in the phosphatome of
the TriTryp suggest that phosphorylation-dependent processes in these organisms may have a distinct organisation
and physiological imprint that is worth a more detailed
experimental exploration. Moreover, these distinct traits
may be exploited in the selection of new targets for drugdesign and development of therapeutic compounds taking advantage of the existing specific protein phosphatase
inhibitors.

Methods
Ontology classification
The three protein data sets were obtained from GeneDB
[109] (versions released in May 2006). The T. cruzi
genome is a hybrid of two very closely related species and

Page 15 of 22

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:434

so many genes are present in two very similar forms.
Using the Clusters of orthologous genes data [2] and
sequence similarity searching, the shortest of each protein
duplicate was removed. The phosphatase classification
process was performed in a similar way to the method
used previously to classify phosphatases from the human
and Aspergillus fumigatus genomes [27]. Four components
are required for the ontology classification: the phosphatase ontology (written in the Web Ontology Language
OWL [110]), a description logic reasoner (Racer Pro version 1.9.0) [111], the Instance Store [112] and the
domain compositions of all protein sequences, obtained
through InterProScan [113], (version 13.1 of the InterPro
database) [114]. The OWL ontology for the protein phosphatases was constructed using the Protégé ontology editor [79], which enables different types of protein
phosphatase family members to be defined in terms of
their domain architectures. These ontological descriptions
of types of phosphatase were combined with the InterProScan domain information for individual proteins from
each genome and the classification against the ontology
was carried out through the Instance Store. The Instance
Store combines a description logic reasoner and a relational database and provides an interface through which
the data can be queried to return the results of the classification. The reasoner checks for logical inconsistencies in
the ontology and performs the classification of individual
phosphatases according to the types described in the
ontology. The relational database of the Instance Store
enables large numbers of protein instances to be stored.
This system provides, in essence, an extension to the InterProScan domain-matching tool, as it is able to work at the
level of a whole genome and place proteins in defined
classes.
Using dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DSPs) as an
example of the process, they are defined in the ontology
as any protein possessing, amongst other features, a
generic PTP domain (based on the HCX5R consensus
motif) (IPR000387) and also a more specific DSP domain
(IPR000340). When the Instance Store is queried for all
DSPs, it will return a list of all protein sequences that
matched both of these domains in InterProScan [113].
The types of phosphatase described in the ontology vary
from the general (tyrosine phosphatase) to the specific
(R2A Phosphatase). The classification process will place
any phosphatase to the most specific type possible. Those
proteins not fully classified are either new types not yet
completely described by the ontology, or types for which
there are no InterPro descriptions. To make sure no phosphatases had been missed using the ontology method, the
SMART domain database [115] was scanned and
sequence similarity searching was used (using BlastP programs from both NCBI and Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL [116]).
Note that searches using more recent versions of InterPro

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/434

may give slightly different results to those reported in this
work due to updating of InterPro entries and also entries
in the databases scanned by InterPro.
Domain architecture analysis
This was performed with the information obtained from
InterProScan [113]. Quality control methods were
employed to distinguish true domain matches from low
scoring matches. Each domain match was submitted for
sequence similarity searching against the Swiss-Prot/
TrEMBL database [116] to determine whether they
matched other sequences with the same domain. As InterPro is a secondary domain database and searches other
bioinformatics databases, the original motifs or domains
descriptions and criteria were investigated for each InterPro match. For example, if the InterPro domain was based
on a PRINTS fingerprint [117] entry then we investigated
how many motifs of the fingerprint did actually match the
query sequence. If an InterPro domain match had support
from several other databases, then it was deemed to have
good support and was included in this study.
Sequence analysis of the phosphatase catalytic domains
Multiple alignments were produced with ClustalX [118]
and manually edited with BioEdit [119] to obtain the
most robust alignments for phylogenetic analyses.
Detailed sequence analyses were performed for each kinetoplastid phosphatase subfamily. Motifs previously
described as conserved in other eukaryotic catalytic
domains were compared to the kinetoplastid phosphatase
catalytic domains [25,26,82,91,92,120-122]. Further
sequence similarity searching and motif analysis was done
for the "kinatases" to analyse the features of the kinase
domain and the conservation of the kinase-phosphatase
domain architecture in other organisms. From BlastP
searching at Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL [116], the closest annotated sequences to the kinetoplastid kinatases were found
to be mammalian calcium-dependent kinase kinases
(CaMKKs). A ClustalX multiple alignment was created of
the kinase domains of CaMKKs from several eukaryotes
(human, mouse, rat, X. laevis, D. rerio, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, D. discoideum, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana) to
identify conserved motifs. This alignment was manually
edited and the conserved residues determined using
descriptions of the 11 conserved kinase subdomains. The
InterPro and SMART databases were queried to determine
if kinatases were present in any other species.

Additional sequence similarity searching was performed
for the DSPs containing Leucine Rich Repeats (LRRs)
using BlastP [123]. The LRR regions from the six kinetoplastid sequences (LRR-DSPs and kinatases) were analysed for the closest matches in other organisms,
particularly human. A BlastP search was also done for the
region
containing
an
ankyrin
domain

phatase alignment integrating results from each method.
Bootstrap and Bayesian clade credibility values of 70%
and above are shown in the figures.

Phylogenetic analysis
A previously established and thorough phylogenetics
approach was used [124] to produce the evolutionary
trees. The different ClustalX alignments created from the
phosphatase catalytic domain sequence analyses were
used for the phylogenetic tree construction. All human, S.
cerevisiae and A. thaliana sequences from each phosphatase subfamily were included in the alignments,
unless the sequences were fragments or had deletions in
important conserved regions. These sequences were
included as markers and to give some functional definition to the clades in each tree determining the similarity
between T. cruzi, T. brucei and L. major protein phosphatases with those from other eukaryotes of different
complexities. BioEdit was used to manually improve the
alignments and remove all gap-containing sites before the
trees were created.

For the MKP and lipid phosphatases phylogenetic analyses a preliminary NJ tree was produced containing all
DSPs and lipid phosphatases from the three kinetoplastids, human, yeast and plant. The MKP and lipid
phosphatase-containing regions were of most interest so
only sequences from these groups were used for the full
analysis using all four methods.
A separate analysis was performed for the kinetoplastid
sequences originally identified as Low Molecular Weight
PTPs (LMW-PTPs) and Cdc25. A ClustalX multiple
sequence alignment included human and yeast LMWPTP, bacterial ArsC reductases, human and mouse Cdc25
and Arc2 reductases from S. cerevisiae and plants, together
with the putative kinetoplastids Cdc25 and LMW-PTPs. A
phylogenetic tree was calculated as above.

List of abbreviations
ClustalX neighbour-joining (NJ) trees were produced for
each of the alignments and the reliability of these was
tested using three separate methods: Bayesian analysis
using MrBayes (version 3.1.2, [125]), maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods using the
PHYLIP package (version 3.63) [126] and Tree-Puzzle
(version 5.2, [127]. ClustalX NJ trees were used in favour
of PHYLIP Neighbour-Joining as the PHYLIP NJ trees differed from results with the other three methods. This was
particularly noticeable in groups of three sequences with
one sequence from each parasite, as ClustalX-NJ trees, and
Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony methods
would group the two trypanosome sequences together
with the Leishmania sequence less closely related,
although PHYLIP's NJ methods would consistently show
other orientations.
The MrBayes programme Markov Chain Monte Carlo, was
used to generate an optimal tree using Bayesian methods.
For Maximum Likelihood analysis, firstly gamma correction values were generated from Tree Puzzle [127]. This
gives a more accurate model of amino acid substitutions
as it models the rate of evolution against the frequency of
sites with that rate. The value for each sequence alignment
was input into the PHYLIP program, PROML. Global rearrangement was also used to improve the results as this
option allows the programme to re-evaluate the placing of
each sequence within the tree. Maximum Parsimony was
performed using SEQBOOT, PROTPARS and CONSENSE
from PHYLIP. For both ClustalX Neighbour Joining and
Maximum parsimony 1000 bootstrap replicates were produced to give improved statistical values for the consensus
trees. Final consensus trees were produced for every phos-
