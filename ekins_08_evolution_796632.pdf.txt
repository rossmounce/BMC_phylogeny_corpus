Abstract
Background: The pregnane X receptor (PXR) shows the highest degree of cross-species
sequence diversity of any of the vertebrate nuclear hormone receptors. In this study, we
determined the pharmacophores for activation of human, mouse, rat, rabbit, chicken, and zebrafish
PXRs, using a common set of sixteen ligands. In addition, we compared in detail the selectivity of
human and zebrafish PXRs for steroidal compounds and xenobiotics. The ligand activation
properties of the Western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) PXR and that of a putative vitamin D
receptor (VDR)/PXR cloned in this study from the chordate invertebrate sea squirt (Ciona
intestinalis) were also investigated.
Results: Using a common set of ligands, human, mouse, and rat PXRs share structurally similar
pharmacophores consisting of hydrophobic features and widely spaced excluded volumes indicative
of large binding pockets. Zebrafish PXR has the most sterically constrained pharmacophore of the
PXRs analyzed, suggesting a smaller ligand-binding pocket than the other PXRs. Chicken PXR
possesses a symmetrical pharmacophore with four hydrophobes, a hydrogen bond acceptor, as
well as excluded volumes. Comparison of human and zebrafish PXRs for a wide range of possible
activators revealed that zebrafish PXR is activated by a subset of human PXR agonists. The Ciona
VDR/PXR showed low sequence identity to vertebrate VDRs and PXRs in the ligand-binding
domain and was preferentially activated by planar xenobiotics including 6-formylindolo-[3,2b]carbazole. Lastly, the Western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) PXR was insensitive to vitamins
and steroidal compounds and was activated only by benzoates.
Conclusion: In contrast to other nuclear hormone receptors, PXRs show significant differences
in ligand specificity across species. By pharmacophore analysis, certain PXRs share similar features
such as human, mouse, and rat PXRs, suggesting overlap of function and perhaps common
evolutionary forces. The Western clawed frog PXR, like that described for African clawed frog
PXRs, has diverged considerably in ligand selectivity from fish, bird, and mammalian PXRs.

Background
The pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2; also known as steroid and xenobiotic receptor) is a member of the nuclear
hormone receptor (NR) superfamily [1,2]. PXR functions
as a ligand-activated transcription factor and regulates the
metabolism, transport, and excretion of exogenous compounds, steroid hormones, vitamins, bile salts, and xenobiotics. A remarkably diverse array of compounds activate
human PXR, although generally only at micromolar concentrations (less commonly at high nanomolar concentrations), consistent with a hypothesized function of PXR
as a toxic compound sensor [3,4] (see Figure 1 for chemical structures of some PXR activators).
PXR genes have been cloned and functionally characterized from a variety of vertebrate species, including
human, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, pig,
chicken, frog, and zebrafish [1,4-12]. Like other NRs,
PXRs have a modular structure with two major domains:
an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a larger
C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). The PXR LBD
is unusually divergent across species, compared to other
NRs, with only 50% sequence identity between mammalian and non-mammalian PXR sequences; other NRs tend
to have corresponding sequence identities at least
10–20% higher [12,13]. Even the PXR DBD, which is
more highly conserved across species than the LBD, shows
more cross-species sequence diversity than other NRs [1216]. A detailed phylogenetic analysis of the entire vertebrate NR superfamily demonstrated evidence of positive
evolutionary selection for the LBD of PXRs [17].
In this study, we compare in detail the selectivity of
human and zebrafish PXRs for steroid hormones and
related compounds. We also compare human, mouse, rat,
rabbit, chicken, frog, and zebrafish PXRs with a set of
common compounds that activate most PXRs. These in
vitro data are used to develop pharmacophore models to
capture the essential structural and chemical features of
activators of these PXRs (pharmacophore models summarize the key features important for biological activity).
Commonly used features in pharmacophore models
include hydrophobic, hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrogen
bond donor, and excluded volumes (areas where atoms
are not allowed, e.g., due to steric overlap with receptor
amino acid residues).
We sought to probe the distant evolutionary history of
PXR and the related vitamin D receptor (VDR; NR1I1) by
studying an invertebrate NR1I-like receptor. The draft
genome of the chordate invertebrate Ciona intestinalis (sea
squirt; a urochordate) revealed a single gene [GenBank:
BR000137] with close sequence similarity to the vertebrate VDRs, PXRs, and constitutive androstane receptors
(CARs, NR1I3) [18,19] (see Additional file 1 for sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/103

alignment). NR1I-like genes were also detected in the
genomes of the fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) and the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [20], although these
genes have yet to be functionally characterized. The draft
genome of the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) revealed several putative NR1H-like genes but no
NR1I-like genes [21]. The early evolutionary history of the
NR1I subfamily (VDR, PXR, CAR) in vertebrates is not
completely clear, but one hypothesis is that a single ancestral 'VDR/PXR' gene duplicated, with the two genes then
diverging into distinct VDRs and PXRs, both of which are
currently found in both mammalian and non-mammalian species [22]. We follow the convention of referring to
the non-mammalian PXR/CAR-like genes as PXRs [12],
although it is not clear whether the function of the single
gene in fishes and chicken is more similar to mammalian
CAR or PXR [9,10]. The duplication of a single VDR/PXR
gene into two different genes may have occurred during a
complex series of gene duplications that are thought to
have occurred in early vertebrate evolution, based on
analysis of lamprey and hagfish genes [23]. Later in vertebrate evolution (probably early on in or before the evolution of mammals), a single PXR-like ancestral gene then
duplicated with subsequent divergence into the separate
PXR and CAR genes found in all mammals sequenced
thus far [9]. For simplicity, the single Ciona intestinalis
NR1I-like gene will be referred to as 'Ciona VDR/PXR'.
One advantage of studying Ciona intestinalis, in addition
to the genome project data available, is that this animal is
a member of Urochordata, a subphylum now thought to
contain the closest extant relatives of modern vertebrates
[24].
From the Ghost database of Ciona intestinalis Genomic
and cDNA Resources [25], cDNA clone IDs ciem829d05
and cilv048e18 correspond to the Ciona VDR/PXR. Based
on the expressed sequence tag counts, these cDNAs show
highest expression in the larvae and juvenile life stages
and lower expression in eggs, cleaving embryos, young
adults, and mature adults. For adult animals, expression
was seen in gonadal tissue and blood cells. Although
invertebrates are not known to produce and utilize vitamin D pathways, we speculated that the Ciona VDR/PXR
may bind ligands structurally similar to vitamin D, based
on the subsequent evolutionary development and ligand
preferences of vertebrate VDRs. Alternatively, the Ciona
VDR/PXR may function more like vertebrate PXRs, and
assist in protection from toxic levels of endogenous and/
or exogenous compounds, in which case it might bind a
diverse array of ligands. We therefore cloned and
expressed the Ciona VDR/PXR to determine how similar
this receptor is to vertebrate NR1I receptors in terms of
activation by ligands.

Activities are in -log(EC50), with EC50 in molar units for the activation of human or zebrafish PXR. Efficacy is relative to 10 μM rifampicin (human
PXR) or 20 μM 5α-androstan-3α-ol (zebrafish PXR) which are assigned an efficacy of 1.0. Toxicity is the lowest concentration in micromolar that
produced significant toxicity in the HepG2 cells.

(Table 1), 29 pregnane steroids (Table 2), 50 bile salts
(Additional file 2; some bile salts were previously published [15]), and 50 additional diverse compounds that
included xenobiotics and vitamins (Table 3) (see Figure 1
for selected chemical structures of an androstane steroid,
a pregnane steroid, two bile salts, and two additional
compounds). These activation data further confirm the
broad ligand specificity of human PXR, with most compounds only activating at micromolar concentrations.
Comparison of human and zebrafish PXRs
In two prior studies that compared PXRs from different
species, human and zebrafish PXRs were found to share
some activating ligands, including pregnanes, androstanes, and a few xenobiotics such as nifedipine and phenobarbital [12,15]. Activation of zebrafish PXR by the
much larger set of 165 compounds tested on human PXR

was determined in this study, and these two species
showed considerable overlap in their ligand specificity
(Tables 1, 2, 3, Additional file 2). Human PXR has very
broad specificity for steroid hormones and their synthetic
intermediates (Figure 2A) albeit mostly at micromolar
concentrations likely to exceed typical physiologic concentrations [2,8].
Zebrafish PXR was activated by far fewer steroid compounds which were essentially a subset of those that activate human PXR (Figure 2B). For both human and
zebrafish PXRs, pregnane steroids showed the highest
activity (Figure 2, Table 2). Human and zebrafish PXRs
showed more differences in regard to bile salt activators
with zebrafish PXR being activated by very few of the bile
salts tested (Additional file 2). In terms of the evolution of
bile salts, human PXR is activated by both evolutionary

Activities are in -log(EC50), with EC50 in molar units for the activation of human or zebrafish PXR. Efficacy is relative to 10 μM rifampicin (human
PXR) or 20 μM 5α-androstan-3α-ol (zebrafish PXR) which are assigned an efficacy of 1.0. Toxicity is the lowest concentration in micromolar that
produced significant toxicity in the HepG2 cells.

'early' bile salts [26-28] (e.g., 27-carbon bile alcohol sulfates such as 5α-cholestan-3α,7α,12α,26,27-pentol
[cyprinol] 27-sulfate) and 'recent' bile salts (e.g., cholic
acid) (Additional files 2 and 3). Zebrafish PXR is activated
only by early bile salts, including 5α-cyprinol sulfate and
5β-scymnol
(5β-cholestan-3α,7α,12α,24,26,27-hexol)
27-sulfate (Additional files 2 and 3). The results are con-

sistent with crystallographic studies of human PXR that
show a large, flexible ligand-binding pocket [29-34]. This
pocket can accommodate bile salts of both 5α (A/B trans)
and 5β (A/B cis) orientation (Figure 1), as well as those
with differing side-chain lengths and conjugation. This is
in contrast to studies of farnesoid X receptors (FXRs;
NR1H4) and VDRs, two other NRs that are activated by

PXR activation and steroid pathways
PXR activation and steroid pathways. Steroid pathways typical of vertebrates are indicated. (A) Human PXR is activated
by a large number of steroid hormones, although typically at micromolar concentrations. The coloring indicates at which concentrations the various steroids activate human PXR (see key in bottom right of panel). (B) Zebrafish PXR is activated by a
smaller number of steroid hormones than human PXR, although there is much overlap between the selectivity of the two
PXRs. Zebrafish PXR tends to be more sensitive to steroid hormone activation, at least for the functional assay used in this
study. The coloring indicates at which concentrations the various steroids activate zebrafish PXR using the same key as in (A).

bile acids [35-38]. In particular, FXRs are antagonized by
5α-bile alcohol sulfates [39] while VDRs are essentially
only activated by the smallest bile salt, lithocholic acid
(5β-cholan-3α-ol-24-oic acid), and its metabolites
[38,40,41].
Pharmacophore models for six PXRs
In a comparative study, we determined concentrationresponse curves for a common set of 16 compounds (steroids, bile salts, xenobiotics) in a set of PXRs from six species (human, zebrafish, mouse, rat, rabbit, and chicken;
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, Additional file 2). The pharmacophores
generated are shown mapped to two of the generally more
active
ligands,
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TCDD) and 5β-pregnane-3,20-dione (Figure 3). Human,
rat, and mouse PXRs showed very similar pharmacophores with 4–5 hydrophobic features and multiple
excluded volumes (Figure 3A,C,D). The pharmacophores
for these three PXRs all suggest generally large ligandbinding pockets with differences only in positions of the
features. It is interesting that compared with previous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/103

pharmacophores for human PXR [42-44] which contained 4–5 hydrophobic features and at least 1–2 hydrogen bonding moieties, there are no hydrogen bonding
features in the current human PXR pharmacophore. This
could be due to the molecules used in the current training
set being mostly bile salts and having active and inactive
compounds with similar features. As the Catalyst pharmacophore generation method looks for differences between
the extremes of activity to describe the features contributing to the pharmacophore, this may represent a limitation
of the method. While a single universal pharmacophore
for human PXR (and perhaps PXRs from other species)
may be impossible due to the size and flexibility of the
binding site, it is likely in the current study that the 16
selected molecules may just be a sub-section of the binding pocket. For example, this may be where steroidal compounds fit [33] as modelled previously with a
pharmacophore [45]. Therefore, the pharmacophores
serve as a novel qualitative method for analysis of PXR ligand specificity across the species.

PXR, (C) mouse PXR, (D) rat PXR, (E) rabbit PXR, and (F) chicken PXR. The pharmacophores were generated from the same
16 molecules using Catalyst. The molecules mapped to each pharmacophore are TCDD (green) and 5β-pregnane-3,20-dione
(grey). It should be noted that TCDD is inactive in rabbit PXR and only maps to the hydrophobic features. The pharmacophore
features are hydrophobic (cyan), hydrogen bond acceptor and vector (green), and excluded volume (grey).

Zebrafish PXR showed the most constrained pharmacophore based on the 16 ligands, suggesting a small binding pocket compared with the other PXRs, consisting of 3
hydrophobes, 1 hydrogen bond acceptor, and excluded
volumes (Figure 3B). Rabbit PXR had a similar pharmacophore model to zebrafish PXR but no excluded volumes
as in the former (Figure 3E). Chicken PXR had a pharmacophore qualitatively different from the other PXRs, with
the model indicating a symmetrical array of features that
contribute to activity (Figure 3F); it is perhaps noteworthy

that this PXR has a smaller 'insert' sequence between helices 1 and 3 of the LBD than that of human, mouse, rat,
and rabbit PXRs [9,12]. The pharmacophore models for
both chicken and zebrafish PXRs also show a hydrogen
bond acceptor not found in the models for PXRs from
other species (Figure 3); this hydrogen bonding interaction may contribute to the relatively high activity of
TCDD in chicken and zebrafish PXRs. Pharmacophore
statistical summaries are presented in Additional file 4.

Unusual pharmacology of Xenopus frog PXRs
Whereas other vertebrates such as human, mouse, rat,
chicken, and zebrafish have a single PXR gene in their
respective genomes, two PXRs have been identified in the
African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) [7,46]. This is likely a
consequence of the tetraploidy of the X. laevis genome
[47]. The phylogeny confirms that these two genes are
bone fide orthlogs to mammalian PXR; however their pharmacology and tissue expression pattern is markedly different [7,46,48,49]. Xenopus laevis PXRs are alternatively
termed 'benzoate X receptors' (BXRs) due to their activation by endogenous benzoates (such as 3-aminoethylbenzoate; Figure 1) that play a role in frog development [7].
Similar benzoates have yet to be characterized in other
animals, suggesting that these may be unique to amphibians. In addition to PXRs, other gene families show divergence in Xenopus laevis relative to other vertebrates. PerARNT-Sim (PAS) proteins such as the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AHR) nuclear translocator are an example [50].

Our search of the sequenced genome of the related Western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis; an animal with a diploid genome) revealed only a single PXR gene. Cloning of
the LBD of this PXR from adult female ovary and expression in a GAL4-LBD chimeric construct allowed for determination of ligand specificity. Similar to studies of the
Xenopus laevis PXRs, the Xenopus tropicalis PXR was insensitive to steroids, vitamins, and xenobiotics that activate
mammalian or chicken PXRs, but was activated by two
benzoates described as activators of the Xenopus laevis
PXRα (Additional File 5) [7,49].

Properties of the Ciona intestinalis VDR/PXR
Sequencing of the Ciona intestinalis genome revealed a single gene with similarity to vertebrate NR1I genes VDR,
PXR, and CAR [18,19]. We previously reported a preliminary analysis of the Ciona VDR/PXR [51] and now present
more detailed data. While the DBD of the Ciona VDR/PXR
can be easily aligned to the corresponding sequence of
vertebrate VDRs, PXRs, and CARs, alignment of the LBD is
difficult in some regions (Additional file 1). As summarized in Table 5, the LBD of Ciona VDR/PXR has low
sequence identity to vertebrate VDRs, PXRs, and CARs
(17.1%–26.8%). In the DBD, the Ciona VDR/PXR has the
highest sequence identity to sea lamprey and zebrafish
VDRs (Table 5). The phylogeny of the Ciona VDR/PXR, as
inferred by maximum likelihood analysis, does not clearly
group this receptor with either VDRs or PXRs (Figure 4).
This likely indicates that more sequences are needed,
especially additional NR1I receptors (if present) in basal
vertebrates (such as Agnatha) and chordate invertebrates.
The low sequence identity between the Ciona VDR/PXR
and vertebrate VDRs, PXRs, and CARs may be a result of
rapid evolution, which has been detected in some gene
families (including developmental regulators) in Ciona
intestinalis and other tunicates [18,19,52,53].

The LBD of Ciona VDR/PXR was cloned from cDNA fragments generously provided by Professors Yuji Kohara and
Norituki Satoh, and then inserted into the PM2-GAL4
plasmid to create an LBD/GAL4 chimeric receptor. Unlike
similar constructs derived from the vertebrate VDRs, this
Ciona VDR/PXR was not activated by any vitamin D derivatives, vertebrate bile salts, or steroid hormones (Addi-

tional file 5). Screening of a 76-compound nuclear
hormone receptor ligand library (BIOMOL International,
Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) revealed that 6-formylindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole activated Ciona VDR/PXR in the low

micromolar range (Additional file 5). 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (20 μM) was chosen as the reference
maximal activator of Ciona VDR/PXR. Screening of an
additional 90 compounds comprising steroid hormones,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:103

vitamins (other than vitamin D), benzoates, and xenobiotics revealed that carbamazepine and n-butyl-p-aminobenzoate also activated Ciona VDR/PXR in the
micromolar range (Additional file 5). Interestingly, 6formylindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole, carbamazepine, and nbutyl-p-aminobenzoate are all planar molecules.
The Catalyst pharmacophore approach can also be used to
generate common feature (HIPHOP) alignments [54] of
the three molecules that active Ciona VDR/PXR. In this
case the pharmacophore consisted of 1 hydrogen bond
acceptor and 2 hydrophobic areas (Additional file 6). This
pharmacophore is generally quite different compared
with the models for other PXRs described above and in
many ways reflects the very narrow substrate selectivity
compared with the other six species.
Phylogenetic analysis and ancestral reconstruction of
NR1I receptors
Compared to other vertebrate NR subfamilies, the evolutionary history of the NR1I subfamily is difficult to reconstruct due to a high degree of functional and sequence
divergence [10,12,22]. Some studies speculate that an
ancestral gene duplicated early in vertebrate evolution (or
possibly even prior to evolution of vertebrates), with subsequent divergence to become separate PXR and VDR
genes [9,10,12,15,17,20,22,51]. Later in vertebrate evolution, a single PXR gene duplicated, with subsequent divergence to form separate PXR and CAR genes [10].
Throughout this manuscript, we follow the convention of
designating the non-mammalian PXR/CAR-like genes as
PXRs [12], although it is not certain that the ancestral
PXR/CAR-like gene is actually the same gene now called
PXR in mammals [9,10,20].

Using 49 amino acid sequences of extant VDRs, PXRs, and
CARs, we inferred phylogeny by maximum likelihood
(Figure 4). Several clusters are clearly evident and supported by bootstrap analysis in the phylogeny presented
in Figure 4: vertebrate VDRs, mammalian CARs, and
mammalian PXRs. The major difficulty is the placement
of the frog PXRs, which are quite different from other
PXRs in function, tissue expression, and sequence
[7,46,48,49]. The chicken PXR clusters with the CARs in
Figure 4; however, by many measures, chicken PXR is
equally related to mammalian CARs and PXRs [9,10,12].
We also utilized maximum likelihood to infer the amino
acid sequence of three 'ancestral' receptors, indicated as
nodes in Figure 4 labelled as 'AncR1', 'AncR2', and 'AncR3'
(Additional file 7). AncR1 represents the ancestral single
receptor gene prior to duplication and subsequent divergence to VDRs and PXRs. AncR2 represents the PXR gene
ancestral to the split between fish PXRs and mammalian
CARs/PXRs. AncR3 represents the ancestral single receptor

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/103

gene prior to duplication and subsequent divergence to
mammalian PXRs and chicken PXR/mammalian CARs. It
should be pointed out that ancestral reconstruction based
on receptors that are markedly divergent in sequence, particularly when there are insertions or deletions of receptors relative to one another, is subject to significant
uncertainly and should be interpreted cautiously. The
inter-helical regions of the LBD are particularly difficult to
predict. For the LBD, the percentage of amino acid residues with posterior probability greater than 0.7 is only
56.4%, 80.4%, and 65.0% in AncR1, AncR2, and AncR3,
respectively (Additional file 7). These overall posterior
probabilities are significantly lower than reconstruction of
ancestral sex and mineralocortoid NRs (in the NR3 family) [55-57], where the cross-species sequence divergences
are much less than for the NR1I subfamily of receptors.
These uncertainties make homology modelling (or even
functional expression) of the LBDs of reconstructed NR1I
ancestral sequences unreliable. Therefore, we focused on
cross-sequence comparisons of amino acid residues identified as interacting with ligands in crystal structures of
human VDR [58-60], rat VDR [61,62], zebrafish VDR
[63], human PXR [29-34], human CAR [64,65], and
mouse CAR [66]. In this subset of 'ligand-binding residues', the percentage of amino acid residues with posterior probability greater than 0.7 is 56.8%, 90.2%, and
80.4% in AncR1, AncR2, and AncR3, respectively (Additional file 8); each of these values is higher than for the
overall LBD sequence indicated above.
At the amino acid residue positions identified as ligandbinding residues, we compared Ciona VDR/PXR, AncR1,
AncR2, and AncR3 to mammalian PXRs (human, mouse,
rat, rabbit), chicken PXR, Xenopus laevis PXRα and PXRβ,
zebrafish PXR, human CAR, human VDR, and sea lamprey VDR (Figure 5). As with overall sequence comparisons in the LBD (Table 5), sequence identities at ligandbinding residues for Ciona VDR/PXR compared to the
other receptors were overall low (< 25%). Interestingly,
AncR1 showed the highest sequence identity to human
VDR (64.7%); all other sequences were less than 51%
identical to AncR1 (Figure 5 and Additional file 8). This
would be consistent with VDR being the ancestral NR1I
receptor [51]. The differences between Ciona VDR/PXR
and AncR1 at the ligand-binding residue positions may be
explained by rapid evolution of the Ciona gene, as discussed above. AncR2 had the highest sequence identity at
ligand-binding residues to zebrafish PXR (56.9%), compared to ~ 45–50% for other PXRs and only 31.4% to
human CAR. AncR3 had highest sequence identity at ligand-binding residues to mammalian PXRs (66.7% to
70.6%) compared to only 37.3% to human CAR (Figure 5
and Additional file 8). The results for AncR2 and AncR3
both suggest that CAR has diverged the most from the

Conservation of ligand-binding residues
Conservation of ligand-binding residues. From published X-ray crystallographic structures of human VDR, rat VDR,
zebrafish VDR, human PXR, human CAR, and mouse CAR (see Methods for references), amino acid residues that interact with
ligands ('ligand-binding residues') were identified. At these amino acid residue positions, the sequences of Ciona intestinalis VDR/
PXR, AncR1, AncR2, and AncR3 were compared with the corresponding sequence for human PXR, mouse PXR, rat PXR, rabbit PXR, chicken PXR, Xenopus laevis PXRα, Xenopus laevis PXRβ, zebrafish PXR, human CAR, human VDR, and sea lamprey
VDR. The ordinate represents the percent identity of Ciona intestinalis VDR/PXR, AncR1, AncR2, and AncR3 for the corresponding sequences of PXRs, VDRs, or CAR at these ligand-binding residue positions.

ancestral sequence at ligand-binding residues and would
be consistent with PXR being the ancestral gene.
Intrinsic disorder analysis
A key factor in protein interactions with ligands or other
proteins is presence of intrinsic structural disorder
[67,68]. To assess whether disorder may account for phar-

macological differences between the PXRs from different
species, intrinsic disorder of the amino acid residues were
predicted using the PONDR VL3H algorithm [68] and
summarized by the percentage of residues with probability of disorder greater than 50%. Disorder probabilities
were analyzed by domain (DBD or LBD) or total protein
sequence (Additional files 9 and 10). Rabbit PXR was

Page 13 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:103

shown to possess lower predicted intrinsic disorder in the
LBD compared with human, mouse, rat, chicken, and
zebrafish PXRs. The African clawed frog PXRα (BXRα) had
the lowest predicted intrinsic disorder in the LBD of any
PXR (Additional files 9 and 10); as discussed above, this
receptor has very restricted ligand specificity, essentially
responding only to benzoates (and their close structural
analogs) shown to be important in early frog development [7]. In terms of intrinsic disorder, Ciona VDR/PXR
was closer to PXRs than to VDRs in the LBD (Additional
files 9 and 10). The chicken PXR was distinct from the
other PXRs in terms of low intrinsic disorder in the DBD;
in this regard, chicken PXR is much more similar to CARs
(Additional files 9 and 10). This is consistent with the
hypothesis that an ancestral gene very similar to chicken
PXR duplicated, with the two genes ultimately diverging
into separate CAR and PXR genes (chicken PXR has about
equal sequence similarity to mammalian CARs and PXRs)
[9,10,12]. In the DBD, chicken PXR may have structural
features more similar to mammalian CARs than PXRs. The
results are consistent with differences in structural disorder possibly contributing to differences in pharmacologic
specificity.

Discussion
PXRs show unusually low sequence conservation in the
LBD across vertebrate species relative to other NRs
[12,13,17]. Several groups have hypothesized that crossspecies differences in the presence and utilization of
endogenous and/or exogenous ligands have provided the
evolutionary force for this divergence [8,15,69-71]. In this
study, we have generated considerable new in vitro data
that has enabled us to determine pharmacophore models
for activation of six PXRs (human, mouse, rat, rabbit,
chicken, and zebrafish) using a common set of 16 compounds. The pharmacophore models of human, mouse,
and rat PXRs are quite similar overall, while the pharmacophore models for zebrafish and chicken PXRs are significantly different compared with those for the mammalian
PXRs. The in vitro and modelling data support a smaller
ligand-binding pocket for zebrafish PXR. Our data for the
Western clawed frog PXR show that this receptor, similar
to African clawed frog PXRs [7,49], may be sensitive only
to benzoates and close analogs.
We also report the first characterization of the Ciona intestinalis VDR/PXR. Sequencing of the C. intestinalis genome
reveals only a single NR1I-like gene, along with two
NR1H-like genes [19]. The Ciona 'VDR/PXR' has substantially less sequence identity in the LBD to either VDR or
PXR than in the DBD, and the receptor was not activated
by any of the steroids, bile salts, or vitamin D analogs
tested. However, a planar ligand previously reported to
activate AHRs, 6-formylindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole [72]
robustly activated the Ciona VDR/PXR. Weaker activation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/103

was also achieved with two other planar ligands, carbamazepine (an anti-epilepsy medication) and n-butyl paminobenzoate (a compound that also activates African
clawed frog PXRs [7,12,49], Western clawed frog PXR (this
report), as well as several other PXRs [12]). A preliminary
three-point pharmacophore indicates a relatively planar
pharmacophore for Ciona VDR/PXR consisting of an offcenter hydrogen bond acceptor flanked by two hydrophobic regions. This pharmacophore is different compared
with those from the other six species described herein in
that it is more restrictive. Intrinsic disorder analysis also
suggests that Ciona VDR/PXR is more similar to PXR in the
LBD than to VDR. The added disorder in the LBD (relative
to VDR) may make it able to adapt to different ligands.
Our phylogenetic analysis, including reconstruction of
ancestral sequences by maximum likelihood, is consistent
with (although certainly does not prove) the hypothesis
that VDR represents the ancestral NR1I gene [51,73].
Comparison of ligand-binding residue positions between
extant and reconstructed ancestral sequences also suggests
that PXR may represent the gene ancestral to extant mammalian CARs and PXRs. Identification of additional NR1I
receptors in basal vertebrates, chordate invertebrates other
than Ciona, reptiles, and basal mammals will be valuable
in developing a more complete evolutionary history in
future studies.
These results are consistent with the natural ligands of
Ciona VDR/PXR being markedly different than those of
vertebrate VDRs or PXRs. It is perhaps noteworthy that the
most potent and efficacious activator of Ciona VDR/PXR
discovered in this study (6-formylindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole) is also a potent activator of vertebrate AHRs [72,74].
Studies of invertebrate AHRs reveal markedly different ligand selectivity compared to vertebrate AHRs [75] and also
roles of the AHR system in invertebrate development
[76,77]. Future studies will be aimed at identifying possible endogenous ligands of the Ciona VDR/PXR and other
Ciona NRs; however, if the ligands for the Ciona receptor
are exogenous, they may ultimately be difficult to
uncover.

Conclusion
In contrast to other nuclear hormone receptors, we have
demonstrated in vitro that PXRs show significant differences in ligand specificity across species. Further, by pharmacophore analysis, certain PXRs share similar molecular
requirements, suggestive of functional overlap. The PXR
of the Western clawed frog has diverged considerably in
ligand selectivity from fish, bird, and mammalian PXRs.
The LBD of zebrafish PXR is smaller than those of the
mammals and is activated by a more limited range of
compounds. Even more restricted is the small set of ligands found to activate Ciona VDR/PXR. Taken in sum, the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:103

ligand selectivity of PXR is surprisingly species dependent,
and has undergone an ever expanding role in the progression of evolution from pre-chordates to fish to mammals
and birds. The combined results suggest that using a combination of in vitro and computational methods we can
qualitatively explain the unusual evolutionary history
shaping the ligand selectivity of PXRs and this may be
applicable to other proteins.

Methods
Chemicals
The sources of the chemicals were as follows: n-butyl-paminobenzoate, n-propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, nifedipine,
rifampicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA); 5αcholanic acid-3α,7α,12α-triol (allocholic acid; Toronto
Research Chemical, Inc., North York, ON, Canada);
Nuclear Receptor Ligand Library (76 compounds known
as ligands of various nuclear hormone receptors; BIOMOL). 5α-cyprinol sulfate (5α-cholestan-3α,7α,12α,26tetrol-27-sulfate) was isolated from Asiatic carp (Cyprinus
carpio) bile [78], 5β-scymnol sulfate (5β-cholestan3α,7α,12α,24,26-pentol-27-sulfate) was isolated from
the bile of Spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) bile, and
5β-cholestan-3α,7α,12α-triol-27-oic acid, taurine conjugated was isolated from the bile of the American alligator
(Alligator mississippiensis). Bile salts were purified by
extraction and Flash column chromatography. Bile alcohol sulfates were chemically deconjugated using a solution of 2,2-dimethoxypropane:1.0 N HCl, 7:1 v/v, and
incubating 2 hours at 37°C, followed by the addition of
water and extraction into ether. Completeness of deconjugation and assessment of purity was performed by thinlayer chromatography using known standards. Other than
those described above, steroids and bile salts were
obtained from Steraloids (Newport, RI, USA).
Animals
Xenopus tropicalis frogs were obtained from NASCO (Fort
Atkinson, WI, USA). All animal studies were performed in
conformity with the Public Health Service Policy on
Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, incorporated in the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research
Guide for Care and use of Laboratory Animals. All vertebrate animal studies were approved by the University of
Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
(approval number 0601348) or Committee on Animal
Studies of the University of California, San Diego.
Cloning and molecular biology
The LBD of Xenopus tropicalis (Western clawed frog) PXR
(xtPXR) was cloned by PCR from RNA extracted from
ovary of an adult female frog. Ciona VDR/PXR was cloned
from cDNA fragments ciem829d05 and cilv048e18 provided by Professor Yuji Kohara (Center for Genetic
Resource Information, National Institute of Genetics,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/103

Research Organization of Information and Systems,
Mishima, Japan) and Professor Noriyuki Satoh (Kyoto
University, Kyoto, Japan), with analysis of the cDNA
clones supported by Grant-in-aid for Scientific Research
on Priority Area "Genome" of Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan. The LBD of
xtPXR (residues 103–390) and Ciona VDR/PXR (residues
57–391) were inserted into the pM2-GAL4 vector to create
a GAL4/LBD chimera suitable for study of ligand activation [17].
Cell culture and functional assays
The creation of a HepG2 (human liver) cell line stably
expressing the human Na+-taurocholate cotransporter
(NTCP) has been previously reported [17]. HepG2-NTCP
cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium-α containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Plasmids containing
cDNAs for 8 PXRs from 7 species (human, mouse, rat, rabbit, chicken [also called chicken X receptor, CXR], African
clawed frog [also termed Xenopus laevis benzoate X receptors α and β, BXRα and BXRβ ], zebrafish), as well as the
reporter constructs tk-UAS-Luc and CYP3A4-PXRE-Luc,
and 'empty' vectors pCDNA, PsG5, and PM2 were generously provided by SA Kliewer, JT Moore, and LB Moore
(GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The
expression vectors were either full-length receptors (i.e.,
containing both a DBD and LBD; human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and chicken PXRs) or GAL4/PXR chimeras that contain only the LBD of the PXR receptor (BXRα, BXRβ,
Xenopus tropicalis PXR, and zebrafish PXR). For the fulllength expression vectors, the reporter plasmid was
CYP3A4-PXRE-Luc, a construct that contains a promoter
element from CYP3A4 (recognized by PXR DBDs) driving
luciferase expression. For the GAL4/LBD expression constructs, the reporter plasmid was tk-UAS-Luc, which contains GAL4 DNA binding elements driving luciferase
expression. The following transfection ratios of reporter,
receptor, and β-galactosidase plasmids were used (ng/
well): human, mouse, rabbit, and rat PXRs – 25/2.7/20;
chicken PXR – 10/1/20; Xenopus tropicalis PXR, zebrafish
PXR, and Ciona VDR/PXR – 75/50/20.

The PXR activation assay was a luciferase-based reporter
assay [17,45]. On day 1, 30,000 cells/well were seeded
onto 96-well white opaque plates (Corning-Costar, Corning, NY, USA). On day 2, cells were transfected using the
calcium phosphate precipitation method with expression
vector or 'empty' control vector and luciferase reporter
plasmid. On day 3, the cells were washed and then incubated with medium containing charcoal-dextran treated
fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) and drugs
or vehicle. On day 4, the cells were washed and the
medium replaced with serum-free medium. Cells were
washed with Hanks' buffered salt solution and then

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:103

exposed to 150 μL lysis buffer (Reporter Lysis Buffer,
Promega). Separate aliquots were taken for measurement
of β-galactosidase activity (Promega) and luciferase activity (Promega Steady-Glo luciferase assay).
Activation of receptor by ligand was compared to receptor
exposed to identical conditions without ligand ('vehicle
control'). In general, dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) was used
as vehicle and was adjusted to be 0.5% (v/v) in all wells.
A control was also run with transfection of 'empty' vector
(i.e., lacking the receptor cDNA) and reporter vector to
control for activation of reporter vector by endogenous
receptor(s). In experiments with a variety of activators,
activation by endogenous receptors was not seen.
To facilitate more reliable cross-species comparisons,
complete concentration-response curves for ligands were
determined in the same microplate as determination of
response to a maximal activator. This allows for determination of relative efficacy, ε defined as the maximal
response to test ligand divided by maximal response to a
reference maximal activator (note than ε can exceed 1).
The following maximal activators and their concentrations were as follows: human PXR – 10 μM rifampicin;
mouse and rat PXRs – 10 μM pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile; rabbit PXR – 50 μM 5β-pregnane-3,20-dione;
chicken PXR – 20 μM nifedipine; Xenopus tropicalis PXR –
n-propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate 50 μM; zebrafish PXR – 20
μM 5α-androstan-3α-ol; and Ciona VDR/PXR – 20 μM 6formylindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole. All comparisons to maximal activators were done within the same microplate.
Luciferase data were normalized to the internal β-galactosidase control and represent means ± SD of the assays.
Concentration-response curves were fitted using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA). In
combining data from multiple experiments, the pooled
variance was calculated by the formula spooled = {[(n1-1)s12
+ (n2-1)s22 + ... + (nk-1)sk2]/[N-k]}-1/2, where there are N
total data points among k groups, with n replicates in the
ith group.
Toxicity assays in HepG2 cells
To test for cytotoxicity, two assays that have been well-validated in HepG2 cells were used: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction
and alamar blue reduction. Both assays sensitively measure the ability of viable cells to metabolize the parent
compound to a metabolite that can be detected by spectrophotometry or fluorometry [79]. HepG2 cells were
seeded at a density of 20,000 cells/well (100 μL per well)
into clear 96-well microplates (for the MTT assay) or
black, opaque 96-well plates (for the alamar blue assay)
and grown for 24 hours. The next day, 100 μL solutions of
drug concentrations or vehicle controls in cell growth
medium at twice the intended final concentration were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/103

added to the cells (final volume 200 μL). The cells were
again incubated for 24 hr. For the MTT assays, MTT (In
vitro toxicology assay kit, MTT-based; Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) was dissolved at 5 mg/mL in warm cell growth
medium. 20 μL of this solution was added to the cells
(total volume 220 μL), and the plates incubated for
another 4 hrs. After incubation, the supernatant was
removed and 50 μL of solubilization buffer provided in
the Sigma kit with 0.5% DMSO was added. DMSO was
added to ensure total solubility of the formazan crystals.
Plates were shaken for 2 min, and the absorbance
recorded at 590 nm. The percent viability was expressed as
absorbance in the presence of test compound as a percentage of that in the vehicle control (with subtraction of
background absorbance).
For the alamar blue assays, alamar blue stock solution
(Biosource International; Camarillo, CA, USA) was
diluted 1:1 with cell growth medium and 50 μL of this was
added to each well, yielding a final concentration of 10%
alamar blue (total volume 250 μL). The plates were
exposed to an excitation wavelength of 530 nm, and the
emission at 590 nm was recorded to determine whether
any of the test drug concentrations fluoresce at the emission wavelength. Plates were returned to the incubator for
5 hr and the fluorescence was measured again. The percent viability was expressed as fluorescence counts in the
presence of test compound as a percentage of that in the
vehicle control (with subtraction of background fluorescence). Drug concentrations that cause > 30% loss of cell
viability in the MTT assay or > 15% loss of cell viability in
the alamar blue assay were not used in the determination
of concentration-response curves for activation of PXRs.
In silico modelling – Catalyst™
Pharmacophore modelling was performed as described
previously [45,54]. Briefly, computational molecular
modeling studies were carried out using Discovery Studio
1.7 Catalyst™ (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) running on a Sony
Vaio with Intel Centrino processor. Pharmacophore models attempt to describe the arrangement of key features
that are important for biological activity. Briefly, the Catalyst™ models were employed to generate hypotheses.
Molecules were imported from sdf files, the 3-D molecular structures were produced using up to 255 conformers
with the Best conformer generation method, allowing a
maximum energy difference of 20 kcal/mol. Hypogen
PXR pharmacophores for each species were generated
with Catalyst™ using the 16 molecules in Table 4. Molecules highlighted in bold type were used for training as
they are common to all species – molecules with no effect
were given the arbitrary EC50 value of 10,000 μM (10
mM).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/103

Ten hypotheses were generated using these conformers for
each of the molecules and the EC50 values, after selection
of the following features: hydrophobic, hydrogen bond
acceptor, and hydrogen bond donor with up to 4 excluded
volumes. After assessing all ten generated hypotheses, the
hypothesis with the lowest energy cost was selected for
further analysis as this possessed features representative of
all the hypotheses and had the lowest total cost. The quality of the structure activity correlation between the estimated and observed activity values was estimated by
means of an r value. Additionally 6-formylindolo-[3,2b]carbazole was aligned with carbamazepine and n-butylp-aminobenzoate with the HIPHOP alignment to ascertain the pharmacophore for Ciona VDR/PXR.

Phylogeny was inferred by maximum likelihood using
PHYML software [83,84], assuming a WAG protein model
and a 4-category discrete gamma distribution of amongsite rate variation. To estimate support, 100 bootstrap replicates were analyzed. Ancestral protein sequences of
AncR1, AncR2, and AncR3 (see nodes in Figure 4) were
inferred by maximum likelihood using PAML 3.15 software [85,86] on the maximum likelihood phylogeny of
49 amino acid sequences of extant VDRs, PXRs, and CARs
(see Figure 4). For ancestral reconstruction, the JTT+G
model (supported with 100% posterior probability in the
Bayesian analysis) was assumed. Residues that interacted
closely with ligands in published X-ray crystallographic
structures of human VDR [58-60], rat VDR [61,62],
zebrafish VDR [63], human PXR [29-34], human CAR
[64,65], and mouse CAR [66] were identified and designated in Figure 5 and Additional files 7 and 8 as 'ligandbinding residues'.
