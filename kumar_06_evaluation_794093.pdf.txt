Abstract
Background: Availability of high-resolution RNA crystal structures for the 30S and 50S ribosomal
subunits and the subsequent validation of comparative secondary structure models have prompted the
biologists to use three-dimensional structure of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) for evaluating sequence
alignments of rRNA genes. Furthermore, the secondary and tertiary structural features of rRNA are highly
useful and successfully employed in designing rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes intended for in situ
hybridization experiments. RNA3D, a program to combine sequence alignment information with threedimensional structure of rRNA was developed. Integration into ARB software package, which is used
extensively by the scientific community for phylogenetic analysis and molecular probe designing, has
substantially extended the functionality of ARB software suite with 3D environment.
Results: Three-dimensional structure of rRNA is visualized in OpenGL 3D environment with the abilities
to change the display and overlay information onto the molecule, dynamically. Phylogenetic information
derived from the multiple sequence alignments can be overlaid onto the molecule structure in a real time.
Superimposition of both statistical and non-statistical sequence associated information onto the rRNA 3D
structure can be done using customizable color scheme, which is also applied to a textual sequence
alignment for reference. Oligonucleotide probes designed by ARB probe design tools can be mapped onto
the 3D structure along with the probe accessibility models for evaluation with respect to secondary and
tertiary structural conformations of rRNA.
Conclusion: Visualization of three-dimensional structure of rRNA in an intuitive display provides the
biologists with the greater possibilities to carry out structure based phylogenetic analysis. Coupled with
secondary structure models of rRNA, RNA3D program aids in validating the sequence alignments of
rRNA genes and evaluating probe target sites. Superimposition of the information derived from the
multiple sequence alignment onto the molecule dynamically allows the researchers to observe any
sequence inherited characteristics (phylogenetic information) in real-time environment. The extended
ARB software package is made freely available for the scientific community via http://www.arb-home.de.

Background
The backbone of the modern taxonomy of the prokaryotes is almost exclusively based upon a phylogenetic network derived from comparative sequence analysis of the
small subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the respective
phylogenetic marker genes [1]. Since the function of rRNA
is largely determined by its structure [2] and the general
structure of rRNA is universally conserved across all the
taxa that have been examined [3,4], the structural features
of rRNA, even when not universally identical across the
taxa, is more highly conserved than are the nucleotides. As
more knowledge is gained with respect to rRNA higher
order structure through the availability of thousands of
SSU rRNA [5] and LSU rRNA [6] sequences, has led to a
breakthrough in the insight into evolutionary relationships between bacterial phyla [4] and between the major
eukaryotic kingdoms and protist taxa [7]. The unique
properties of rRNA demonstrate that the evolution of
rRNA genes must be considered based on the structural
constraints.
The most basic principle of phylogenetic studies is only
the homologous characters can provide meaningful markers of genealogical descent. So, clearly the accuracy of a
phylogeny from molecular data is critically dependent on
the accuracy of sequence alignment. When there is a significant variability between the sequences due to insertions, deletions and mutations occurred during the course
of evolution, the alignment of such sequences becomes
more difficult and problematic. Given that the number
and character of positional differences between the
aligned sequences are the basis for the inference of relationship, the primary alignments must be evaluated
against certain criteria before processing with the treeing
algorithms in order to reduce such ambiguities. In support, studies have revealed that even small differences in
the sequence alignment can result in quite different phylogenies [8,9]. So, by using structural features of rRNA to
"anchor" homologous positions, many of the inherent
problems of aligning rRNA sequences can be reduced. Furthermore, not all the aligned nucleotide positions or all
types of substitution changes can be treated equally in
terms of phylogenetic relevance because the nucleotides
within the rRNA molecule are involved in different kinds
of interactions, including both hydrogen bonding to
other nucleotides within the molecule and interactions
with ribosomal proteins and other RNA molecules (transfer RNAs). Therefore the knowledge of structural motifs
exhibited by rRNA is greatly useful to align and compare
rRNA sequences in order to produce more accurate and
biologically meaningful alignments of rRNA genes.
The comparative analysis of thousands of rRNA sequences
has yielded more reliable RNA structure models [10],
which are well established and routinely used in the struc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/240

ture based phylogenetic studies. And with the availability
of high-resolution RNA crystal structures for the 30S [11]
and 50S [12] ribosomal subunits and the subsequent validation of comparative rRNA secondary structure models
[10], the biologists are impelled to use three-dimensional
structure of rRNA for evaluating sequence alignments of
rRNA genes. In cases where one of the sequences has a
known three-dimensional structure it can be more
informative to compare the alignment with the solved
structure, to better understand how the local environment
of the nucleotides relates to conservation. In this regard,
all-atom structure of ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli
[13] deduced from the crystal structure of 30S ribosomal
subunit of Thermus thermophilus [11], can be used as a reference structure to evaluate individual rRNA sequences
and the multiple alignments of rRNA genes. Thorough
knowledge of the three-dimensional structure coupled
with the secondary structure information of rRNA is often
necessary to determine true evolutionary relationships
among the rRNA sequences.
Furthermore, information derived from comparative
rRNA sequence analysis has been extensively applied in
microbial ecological studies. Presence of highly conserved
and variable regions within the rRNA sequences is frequently used to identify oligonucleotide target regions
unique to phylogenetic entities, for use as taxon-specific
hybridization probes or PCR primers. The rRNA-targeted
oligonucleotide probes have evolved into a widely used
tool for the direct, cultivation-independent identification
and enumeration of individual microbial cells or specific
groups of bacteria in simple to complex natural environments. One of the hurdles in carrying out successful
hybridization of rRNA sequences is the probe target site
accessibility within the cell. The problems of target inaccessibility is often attributed to strong interactions of
rRNA with ribosomal proteins and/or highly stable secondary and tertiary structure elements of the rRNA itself
[14]. Thus, a thorough in silico evaluation of probe targets
with respect to higher-order rRNA structures often is helpful, although the native structure of the ribosomes is
altered by in situ fixation and hybridization procedures
[3].
In this paper, we describe a program, RNA3D, developed
using OpenGL to visualize and evaluate three-dimensional structure of 16S rRNA molecule and alignments of
rRNA sequences, respectively. The program is capable of
merging structural information with the phylogenetic or
any other information derived from the sequence alignments, dynamically. The integration into the ARB software package [15] achieves interoperability among the
various tools extending the functionality of ARB software
suite substantially.

Implementation
Interface
The RNA3D program uses the popular OpenGL graphics
library combined with Open Motif user interface for
achieving more intuitive rendering and manipulation of
the rRNA molecule with in the ARB environment. The
annotation of RNA three-dimensional structures consists
of a preprocessing of the information embedded in their
3D coordinates. It processes PDB structural information
stored in the PDB file (1M5G) into the annotated structures and renders them into the virtual space using
OpenGL routines. In order to objectively represent the
structural knowledge of three-dimensional rRNA structure, the respective 3D coordinates were extracted from
the PDB file (1M5G) and used for further structural analysis and searches. To provide user with a more detailed
perspective of 16S rRNA structure, structural information
corresponding to the ribosomal proteins were excluded
during processing. The extracted structural information is
then fed to OpenGL engine, where it is further transformed into a hierarchy of OpenGL objects, which encode
molecule chains, residues and base positions. At this
stage, further processing may occur, for example when the
user requests the mapping of secondary structure information of rRNA onto the molecule in the form of loops and
stems. Any information derived from the multiple alignments (phylogenetic information) is merged into the
structural information of rRNA molecule in the postprocessing step.

To achieve more performance and dynamic overlay of any
sequence associated information, rendering was simplified to chain display with a capacity to display the actual
residues – Adenosine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C) and
Uracil (U) at the respective coordinates in the molecule.
Most of the applications which are intended to display
three-dimensional structures, display the entire chemical
structure of the molecule. Viewing the entire chemical
structure in the molecule's 3D structure is less readable for
the user. Additionally, base positions can be displayed at
the respective coordinates or at the intervals specified by
the user.
Navigation
The entire set of visualized objects can be easily rotated,
translated and scaled at the user's wish. Navigation
through the molecule is basically bound to the standard
mouse buttons and mapped to simple keys on the keyboard. The molecule can be zoomed in or out by performing upward or downward motion of the wheel,
respectively. By rotating, translating and scaling of the
molecule users can observe the buried and exposed molecule sections. Furthermore, the current cursor position in
the respective sequence of alignments visualized in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/240

primary or secondary structure editor can be shown in the
three-dimensional structure.
Customization
Since the user customization is an important consideration in the graphical user interface (GUI) design, RNA3D
program provides the individual users with more possibilities to customize the interface to suit their particular purpose and preferences. As a first step toward enhancing the
user customization capability of RNA3D program, any
form of annotation and information overlay can be toggled on and off. This feature allows users to focus on
annotations they consider important without being distracted by the information irrelevant to their particular
needs. Additionally, users are provided with more customization capabilities in the form of specifying different
colors, shapes, letters, and size of the objects rendered
onto the scene at any time using Color Palette, Bases,
Helix, Molecule and Mapping buttons of the RNA3D program. For example, users can colorize the entire molecule
based on the residues that are participating in the loop or
stem formation in the accepted secondary structure model
of 16S rRNA. By defining color range, users can generate
more informative 3D structural maps of 16S rRNA from
the overlay of sequence associated information.
Interoperability
RNA3D program readily establishes connection with the
underlying central ARB database and ARB probe server
[15]. The program co-operates with other tools housed in
the ARB software package such as primary and secondary
structure editors [15], probe design and evaluation tools
[16]. Any change in the data and co-operating tools will
be automatically updated in the program.
Sequence and structural data
The public release of curated small subunit rRNA database
from the ARB project [17] was used as a source for rRNA
data. The secondary structure models of small subunit
rRNA used are according to the comparative RNA website
[18]. The 30S ribosomal subunit structures of Escherichia
coli (PDB entry 1M5G) and Thermus thermophilus (PDB
entry 1J5E) are retrieved from the protein data bank [19]
and used as template structures for the RNA3D program.

Results and discussion
The structural information extracted from the PDB files is
rendered in an OpenGL 3D environment to achieve a
detailed three-dimensional structure of 16S ribosomal
RNA. The rendering speed critically depends on the computational platform where systems highly optimized for
OpenGL are at a greater advantage for their graphical performance. The RNA3D program is based on the tacit
assumption that all the molecules within a family have a
common core with respect to three-dimensional shape

Page 3 of 11

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:240

which is supported by a common secondary structure that
allows key functional groups to adopt similar spatial positions. Thus, the atomic structure model of E. coli 30S
ribosomal subunit [13] is taken as a reference structure to
evaluate rRNA sequences and is further substantiated with
the availability of very few rRNA crystal structures. Furthermore, the studies conducted by Gutell and coworkers
have confirmed the accuracy of the covariation-based secondary structure models of rRNA with the crystal structures of ribosomal subunits [10]. Such studies support the
inclusion and usage of three-dimensional structures of
rRNA for carrying out rRNA based studies.
Merging secondary structural information
The rRNA structural motifs (stems, bulges and loops)
present in well established comparative structure models
of rRNA [10] are extracted and merged with the threedimensional structure data of small subunit rRNA (Figure
1). Furthermore, observations such as presence of
intramolecular interactions (rRNA tertiary interactions)
[20] in the loop regions of the structure can be evaluated
with respect to three-dimensional conformations of ribosomal RNA in real time. The tertiary interactions are attributed to their role in stabilizing tertiary fold of rRNA [13]
and hence they are highly conserved. The deeper insight
into the rRNA crystal structure along with the secondary
and tertiary interactions will have the potential to assist
the user in refining the multiple sequence alignment itself
when a large number of datasets is included.
Mapping rRNA sequence data
Principally, any 16S rRNA sequence can be mapped onto
the three-dimensional structure of small subunit rRNA.
The RNA3D program swiftly performs a pair-wise comparison of a sequence selected in a multiple alignment using
E.coli as a reference and maps it onto the rRNA 3D structure. The selected rRNA sequence is annotated with mutation (base substitutions), insertion and deletion
information at each site as compared to the master
sequence (E. coli). For the regions where the sequences are
aligned without deletion or insertion, direct base substitution (mutation) is applied. Because the C'---C' distance is
essentially the same (~ 10.2 Å) in all Watson-Crick base
pairs [22], this simple procedure preserves the base pairing and the double helical structure while substituting the
bases. Although there do exist the requirement of structural adjustments for non-Watson-Crick base pairs, currently, simple base substitutions are kept because the
development of new models to achieve the necessary
structural adjustments is out of the scope of the RNA3D
program. In the regions where the alignment (of selected
rRNA sequence) involves insertions, the respective insertion points corresponding to E. coli base position in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/240

alignment are shown as down arrows in the crystal structure (Figure 2). The number of insertions and the participating nucleotides can also be displayed at the insertion
points. In the case of regions where deletions are observed
in the alignment corresponding to the master sequence
(E. coli), respective sites in the 3D structure are indicated
as deleted, using symbol (Figure 2). At present, the program displays the deletion and insertions in the 3D model
in reference to E.coli. The structural implications of such
deletions and insertions are not handled by the program
because all the coordinates of the model were experimentally determined not modeled. The program only highlights the sites of deletion and insertion points in the 3D
model. In future, as more and more RNA crystals become
available in PDB, users will have the possibility to switch
the 3D models, dynamically, to closely related organism
rather than referencing to E.coli, to minimize/eliminate
the deletion and insertion sites in the 3D model.
Overlaying of mutation, deletion and insertion information at each site of the sequence alignment when coupled
with the secondary and tertiary interactions of rRNA, gives
the user an over all view of the individual rRNA sequences
with respect to the resolved crystal structure (Figure 2).
Since the accuracy of the phylogenetic tree is dependent
on the proper juxtapositioning of the sequences in the
alignment [10], RNA3D program enables the user to
approximate the best juxtapositioning of sequences that
represent similar placement of nucleotides in their fitted
structural conformation with respect to the master structure. When coupled with ARB secondary structure editor
[15], more accuracy can be achieved in aligning diverse
rRNA sequences. Sequences that form the same secondary
and tertiary structure can be juxtaposed by aligning the
positions that form the same components of the similar
structural elements (for example, aligning the positions
that form the base of the helix or the hairpin loop). Additionally, the entire sequence cannot be viewed at once in
primary sequence alignments, so by superimposing the
sequence onto the 3D structure the user can get a complete view on the entire sequence. The secondary structure
models of rRNA were basically developed based on the
comparative paradigms that the different RNA sequences
can fold into the same secondary and tertiary structures
and the unique structure and function of RNA molecule
are maintained through the evolutionary process of mutation and selection [23,24]. The same assumption can be
extended to the three-dimensional structures of rRNA as
there are, at present, very few rRNA crystal structures
deposited in the protein data bank.

Overlaying information derived from sequence alignments
Dynamic overlay of information derived from the underlying sequence alignment onto the molecule enables the
users to observe any sequence derived meta-information
at the individual residues in a three-dimensional spatial
environment. When variability maps are overlaid onto the
structure, users can identify the conserved and variable
regions in the small subunit of the ribosomal RNA.
Sequence variation with respect to the loop and stem
regions of the rRNA structure can be seen when mutation
information (calculated for the overall sequences in the
database) is superimposed. By setting specific colors to
rRNA structural motifs and interactions, one can immediately see the differences and distribution of potential
interactions in the small subunit of rRNA 3D structure.
Additionally, intermolecular contacts i.e., between 16S
rRNA bases and the ribosomal protein residues, which are
important to stabilize the tertiary fold of the rRNA, as well
as the complex formation of the ribosome [21], can be visualized in the crystal structure. Simple to complex column
statistics that are performed on the multiple alignments of
rRNA genes can also be readily overlaid onto the 3D structure of rRNA. Column statistics such as sequence consensus, base frequency, positional variability based on
parsimony method are calculated using the integrated
tools of ARB package [15]. The column statistics are transformed into different colors based on the user-defined
rules and more informative three-dimensional structural
maps of rRNA are generated (Figure 3). Superimposition
of such statistical data (e.g. positional variability, base frequency) or information derived from the sequence alignments aids the users to carry out in-depth evaluation of
multiple sequence alignments.
Structural evaluation of rRNA targeted probes
Oligonucleotide probes targeting small subunit rRNA are
frequently applied in the molecular ecological studies
employing the technique of Fluorescence in situ hybridization. Since the hybridization is influenced by the
higher-order rRNA structures [14], the structural features
exhibited by rRNA should be considered during the
design and evaluation of rRNA targeted probes. Structural
conformations of target and neighboring regions of rRNA
are crucial for hybridization behavior and hybrid stability.
Studies have shown that the differences in higher-order
structures of rRNA do have considerable influence on the
target site accessibility to rRNA targeted probes even
though the small subunit rRNA is a highly conserved molecule [25]. In accordance, accessibility studies on 16S and
23S rRNA of E. coli and other organisms with respect to
FISH experiments revealed that some regions of E. coli
ribosome are virtually inaccessible for oligonucleotide
probes when FISH is performed [25-28]. Availability of
accessibility data on members of the domains Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya led to the development of consensus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/240

models for the accessibility of the small subunit rRNA to
oligonucleotide probes [25]. In silico evaluation of rRNA
targeted probes with respect to the consensus probe accessibility models and rRNA secondary structure has been
recently reported [16]. Using RNA3D program, users can
get more insights into the proposed probe candidates with
respect to three-dimensional conformations of small subunit rRNA. The localization of the targets of single or multiple [29] probes can be visualized simultaneously in
customizable background colors with in the rRNA 3D
structure. By adjusting the zoom level and rotating the
molecule, users can get an idea about the probable binding site of the proposed probe with respect to the structural conformation of rRNA. Considering both secondary
and tertiary structural interactions of rRNA target users
have an opportunity to evaluate the probe targets with
more confidence before making any decision on the selection of probes. Although the native conformation of
ribosomes is disturbed during the experimental procedures of FISH [25], a thorough in silico evaluation of oligonucleotide probes with respect to the higher-order
structure and experimental accessibility data (Figure 4)
may help the users to design more successful hybridization experiments.
Related work
Several programs have been developed in recent years in
order to achieve overlaying of information derived from
the multiple alignments onto the three-dimensional
structures [30,31]. Most of the programs are limited to
static displays and are restricted to protein molecules. A
somewhat flexible system with dynamic capabilities to
visualize 3D structures has been recently developed [32].
With respect to sequence alignment evaluation, the ARB
facility of direct cooperation of the respective tools and
the alignment editor is missing in such systems. Furthermore, none of the programs mentioned does support the
superimposition of oligonucleotide probes and any additional data that is associated with rRNA genes onto the
rRNA 3D structure. Such unique features of RNA3D program are seldom found in the existing tools, which are
more specialized to visualize the molecules deposited in
the protein data bank. In this regard, our program,
RNA3D, with its dynamic capabilities operating together
with the several tools of ARB package, offers a special platform to carry out in-depth structural analysis with respect
to ribosomal RNA.

Since the RNA3D program uses OpenGL with dedicated
graphics hardware, the processing capabilities offered by
such graphics cards (known as Graphics Processing Units
– GPU) can be utilized for accelerating the program in
future. Using GPUs as coprocessors, non-graphic computations can be performed speeding up the performance of
the applications significantly which is useful for further

positional variability maps. Residues inclining towards yellow are highly variable where as the residues inclining towards red are

data set containing around 40,000 complete 16S rRNA sequences.

Conclusion
Visualization of three-dimensional structure of ribosomal
RNA in an intuitive display provides the biologists with

the greater possibilities to carry out structure based phylogenetic analysis. The RNA3D program allows the changing of display parameters while the molecule is being
displayed without compromising with the performance.

ment. Mapping individual rRNA sequence onto the template structure, users can visually inspect the quality of the
local alignment and identify the regions that may need
any manual checking for further refinement of sequence
alignments. By superimposing column statistics or information derived from the sequence alignments onto the
rRNA 3D structure, users can get more insights into the
individual rRNA genes and carry out in-depth evaluation
of multiple sequence alignments. Dynamic overlay of
information derived from the underlying sequence alignment onto the molecule enables users to observe any
sequence inherited characteristics (phylogenetic and
other information) that influence the individual residues
in a three-dimensional virtual environment. With the possibility of visualizing oligonucleotide probes and mapping probe accessibility models, users can virtually
observe the secondary and tertiary structural implications
of ribosomal RNA on the prospective probe in silico. This
feature might serve as valuable information during
designing successful in situ hybridization experiments.
The integration of RNA3D program into the powerful and
widely used ARB software package enables the communication with the several tools of ARB package achieving
interoperability. Therefore, along with the other tools of
ARB, RNA3D offers the researchers with an all-in-one software platform to carry out a thorough sequence analysis
with much deeper perspective, which is seldom found to
their disposal. In the future, programs with 3D environments will become more important as tools for bioinformatics, as they provide much higher possibilities to
integrate molecular sequence data, structure data and
analysis data on one platform.
