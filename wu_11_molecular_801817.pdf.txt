Abstract
To investigate molecular epidemiology of dengue viruses (DENV) in southern China, a total of 14 dengue isolates
were collected in southern China during each epidemic year between 1978 and 2006 and their full-length genome
sequences were obtained by using RT-PCR method. The E gene sequences from additional 6 dengue fever patients
in Guangzhou in 2006 were also obtained by using RT-PCR method. Combined with DENVs sequences published
in GenBank, phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis were performed. One hundred and twenty-five E
gene sequences and 60 complete genome sequences published in the GenBank were also involved. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that there was a wide genetic diversity of DENVs isolated in southern China. DENV-1 strains exist
in almost all of the clades of genotype I and IV except the Asia 1 clade of genotype I; DENV-2 stains are grouped
into four of the five genotypes except American genotype. DENV-4 strains are grouped into 2 genotypes (I and II).
Phylogenetic analysis also showed that all DENV-4 isolates and two DENV-2 isolates were closely related to the
prior isolates from neighboring Southeast Asia countries. The DENV-1 strain isolated during the 2006 epidemic is
highly homologous to the strains isolated during the 2001 epidemic.
Recombination analysis showed no inter-serotype recombination, but 22 intra-serotype recombination events were
found across the 32 complete genomes of all Chinese isolates. The study suggested that dengue fever epidemic in
Southern China over the past 30 years presented two important modes, 1) imported-cases-induced endemic
prevalence; 2) endogenous epidemic outbreak with natural epidemic focus. Recombination may play an important
role in dengue virus evolution and adaptation.
Background
Dengue fever (DF) and two more severe syndromes,
dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF) are important mosquito-borne diseases in
tropical and subtropical regions [1,2]. Since the first
documented outbreak in 1779 in Jakarta, Indonesia, outbreaks have been documented in tropical and subtropical regions. It has been the maximum public health
burden in South-East Asia countries [3]. Dengue epidemiology changes fast among epidemic countries, and
keeps on expanding to the non-epidemic area [1]. Since
the pathogens were first discovered by Japanese scientists in 1943, dengue viruses (DENV) were isolated from

almost all South-East Asia countries including Thailand,
Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia [3]. The dengue virus belongs to
Flaviviridae family, and has four closely related but different serotypes (DENV-1 through -4) in nature that are
circulating or co-circulating [1,2]. Their genetic diversity
remains wide, due to 1) absence of a proof-reading
capacity in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases [4], 2)
emergence of different lineages or clades during epidemic [5,6], 3) increasing natural recombination [7-10],
and 4) co-circulation of more than one serotypes in a
locality [11-14].
Since imported DF epidemic had been reported in
Hankou, Hangzhou, Shanghai and Guangzhou in 1920s
and 1940s [15], there was no DF case reported in China
till the outbreak occurred in 1978 in Foshan, Guangdong Province, with DENV-4 infection [16]. And then
DF was prevalent in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan
province. A DENV-1 epidemic occurred in 1979 in

Zhongshan, Guangdong Province. This serotype of virus
continued causing outbreaks over 2-3 years intervals. It
become the dominating serotype and caused the latest
outbreak in 2006 [17,18]. DENV-3 epidemic was only
recorded once in 1980 at Zhan County, Hainan Island,
where in 1985 DENV-2 caused an epidemic during
which the first DHF case was reported [19]. After this
DENV-2 epidemic, DENV-2 continued to be transmitted
into Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan until 2001,
including three outbreaks in Foshan in 1993, 1998 and
in Jiangmen in 2001 [20]. The second DENV-4 outbreak
occurred in Guangzhou city in 1990 [20]. It was estimated more than 700,540 hospitalized cases with 513
deaths from 1978 to 2007 [15]. Although the first isolate
was sampled 30 years ago, dengue epidemic in southern
China keeps increasing [15]. Lack of longitudinal
research on dengue epidemics has hampered our understanding of dengue molecular origin and evolution in
China
In this study, we determined the complete genome
sequences of 14 dengue isolates collected in southern
China during each epidemic year between 1978 and
2006 and E gene sequences from six patients of Guangdong, 2006. In combination with those published
sequences in GenBank, we conducted an extensive
molecular epidemiological analysis, aiming to determine
where the DENV isolates in China originally came from,
and what shaped their evolution.

(Table 1). Sucking BALB/c mice and C6/36 cells were
used to isolate viruses from clinical specimens. Serotypes of those isolates were confirmed by indirect
immunofluorescence using anti-DENV monoclonal IgG
(Guangzhou Medicine Institute, China). These isolates
included eight DENV-1 isolates collected from Guangzhou and Chaozhou City of Guangdong province in
1991, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2003 and 2006 epidemic. Four
DENV-2 isolates were collected from Fusan and Jiangmen City of Guangdong Province in 1993, 1998 and
2001 epidemic. Two DENV-4 isolates were collected in
Foshan City during 1978 epidemic and in Guangzhou
city during 1990 epidemic respectively.
Viral RNA extraction and RT-PCR methods

Viral RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corp., California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The cDNA was synthesized by
reverse transcription from 10 μL of RNA at 42°C for 50
min in a 50 μL solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 100
ng of the random hexamer primers, 200 U of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 25 U of RNasin (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mM dNTPs. The PCR was
performed in a 25 μl mixture containing 2 μl of cDNA,
10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2,
100 μM each dNTP, 1 U Taq DNA Polymerase (Shanghai Promage Corp., Shanghai, China), 0.25 μM each primer (Additional file 1, Table S1-S3). The amplification
reactions consisted of an initial denature step of 3 min
at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at
55°C, 60 s at 72°C.

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

GenBank referring to diverse genotype and geographic
localities.
The DENV-1 isolates from Guangdong belong to genotype I and IV (Figure 1B). Within genotype I and IV,
several sub-genotypes can be identified. Two isolates
(CN.GD01/97 and CN.GD99/99) determined in the
study clustered together as a single clade with a 96%
bootstrapping support, which was named as a new Asia4 clade. DENV-1 strains isolated in 2001 and 2006
belong to Asia 3 clade in genotype I. However, the
stains of 2006 could further be divided into three different sub-clades. Eleven strains of 2006 positioned at the
end of the Asia 3 clade and the other four strains positioned at two different sub-clades. Even the eight strains
(two isolates and six patients’ sera) collected in Guangzhou city during the epidemic of DENV-1 in 2006 also
clustered into 2 subclades in Asia 3 clade. All eight
strains collected during 2002 and 2003 period at
Guangzhou were identical and clustered closely as genotype IV type.
Chinese DENV-2 isolates were characterized into four
genotypes except for American genotype (Figure 1C).
Broadly, those collected in pre-1990s fell into Asia/
American and Asia II genotypes, while the post-1990s
belonged to Asia I and Cosmopolitan genotypes. Two
isolates collected in 1998 in Foshan, which belonged to
Asia I genotype, were identical to the strain from Thailand in 1993. Three isolates of Jiangmen in 2001 epidemic showed closely identical to the strain from
Philippines in 2000 epidemic.
Two DENV-4 epidemics occurred in China in the year
of 1978 and 1990. Five isolates collected from the two
epidemic years belonged to genotype I and genotype II
(Figure 1D). Two isolates collected during 1990 epidemic belonged to genotype I and clustered closely with
a strain isolated in 1984 epidemic of Philippines (PH.
12123/84) [GenBank: U18435]. The three other DENV-4
isolates from 1978 epidemic clustered together and fell
into genotype II. They resided in phylogenetic tree
much closer to the Indonesia isolate 30153 (ID. 30153/
73) [GenBank: U18428] collected in 1973 when there
was a severe dengue epidemic.

The determined DENV nucleotide sequences were
deposited in GenBank database under the accession
numbers FJ196841-FJ196860.

Viral genome sequencing and E gene sequencing

The complete genomes of the viruses were sequenced
by a PCR-by-PCR strategy. At the same time, Envelope
(E) gene from six patients’ sera was also amplified. All
primers were synthesized by BGI (Beijing Genomics
Institute, Beijing, China) according to the reference
sequence data of DENV-1 Singapore strain S275/90
[GenBank: M87512], DENV-2 Jamaica strain 1409/88
[GenBank: M20558], and DENV-4 Dominica strain
814669/81 [GenBank: AF326573]. Amplified products
were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and
sequenced using ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzers (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Assembly of Genome Sequences and Sequence Analysis

Genome assembly was performed independently by distinct operators using Phred-Phrap-Consed [21]. The
consensus sequence was yielded exactly with BLASTN
and custom script which was written by Perl for all
strains. A single contig was obtained for each of the 14
isolates. The single contig was aligned to reference by
BLASTN with the E-value of 1e-5. The computation of
substitution tables were performed using a custom program written by Perl.
Neighbor-joining trees were constructed using MEGA
version 3.1 with the Kimura-2 parameter corrections of
multiple substitutions [22]. Reliability of nodes was
assessed by bootstrap resampling with 1,000 replicates.
One hundred and twenty-five E gene sequences and 60
complete genome sequences published in the GenBank
were also involved.
RDP3 was used for recombination analysis. We
employed Bootscan, Chimera, GENECONV, MaxChi,
and RDP methods incorporated in RDP3 Beta 27 program [23-27]. General recombination settings for all
methods were as follows: Sequences were considered as
linear, and the highest acceptable P-value was set to
0.01, and event detected by two or more methods was
taken into consideration.

Results

Phylogenetic tree of DENV-1, -2, and -4 generated by E
gene sequences

To determine the DENV molecular epidemiology in
southern China, 145 E gene sequences were used to
infer a ML phylogenetic tree (Figure 1), including 1)
20 E gene sequences determined in the study, 2)
47 sequences with China localities available from
GenBank, and 3) 78 representative sequences from

Based on the 74 complete coding regions (14 determined in the study and 60 from GenBank), we constructed maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree
(Figure 2).
In the study, the whole genome and the single E gene
phylogenetic tree are in good coincidence with only little differences. Two DENV-1 isolates, CN.GD01/97 and
CN.GD99/99, were assumed to be new members of a
defined Asia-4 clade in E gene tree (Figure 1B), while in

the Asia-3 clade (Figure 2).
Recombination detection

RDP3 software was employed to examine the potential
recombination events of all the Chinese isolates (43
DENV-1,20 DENV-2,2 DENV-3,5 DENV-4) on E gene.
Three recombinant events were detected on the E gene
of DENV-1 with low P-value (P < 0.01) (Table 2), which

was confirmed by phylogenetic construction (Figure 3).
Neither DENV-2 nor DENV-4 has any evidence of such
recombination across their counterparts. The potential
recombination events were also analyzed across the 32
complete ORF of all the Chinese isolates by RDP3 software. No inter-serotype recombination was detected,
but 22 intra-serotype potential recombination events (17
for DENV-1, 5 for DENV-2) were confirmed by more
than two methods (Table 3).

Discussion
Since the first well documented DF outbreak in Foshan
of Guangdong province in 1978, dengue has been
reported periodically in southern China, with the latest
epidemic at Guangdong province in 2006. In this study,
14 Dengue isolates from 1978 to 2006 were sequenced
and analyzed for molecular evolution.

Dengue virus exists as four antigenically distinct
viruses designated as serotypes (DENV-1 through
DENV-4), belonging to genus Flavivirus of family Flaviviridae. It has a positive-sense RNA genome that is
translated as a single polyprotein and posttranslationally
cleaved into three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins [28]. The envelope protein (E) is

considered to be the immunodominant protein [29].
Dengue viruses also could be divided into different genotypes by the E gene [30,31]. So there is correlation
between serotypes and genotypes of Dengue virus. Phylogenetic trees of DENV-1, -2 and -4 generated by ORF
and E gene sequences showed that there was a wide
genetic diversity of DENVs isolated in southern China
(Figure 1, Figure 2). DENV-1 strains exist in almost all
of the clades of genotype I and IV but Asia 1 clade of
genotype I (Figure 1B, Figure 2). DENV-2 strains are
grouped into four genotypes except American genotype
(Figure 1C, Figure 2). DENV-4 strains are grouped into
2 genotypes (I and II) (Figure 1D, Figure 2). It also
showed that different serotypes and genotypes epidemic
prevalence exist in the same city and even during the
same epidemic (Figure 1, Figure 2). It indicated that
these dengue viruses maybe have different origination.
Some of isolates, especially the first emerging of certain dengue serotype strains in southern China were closely related to those strains which were isolated in prior
epidemics from neighboring Southeast Asia countries. It
indicated that these dengue epidemics may be imported
into China from the neighbor countries. For DENV-2,
there were two outbreaks in Foshan in 1993 and 1998.
Isolates from 1998 epidemic was closely related to the
isolates from 1993 epidemic in Thailand (Figure 1C). The
same situation was showed in DENV-4 isolates from
1978 and 1990 epidemics. Isolates from 1978 epidemic
was closely related to the isolates from 1973 epidemic in
Indonesia (Figure 1D). Isolates form 1990 epidemic was
closely related to the isolates from 1984 epidemic in Philippines (Figure 1D). It indicated that these epidemics
maybe imported into China from neighbor countries.
Although some data showed the dengue fever were
imported from neighbor countries, those epidemics with
the same serotype of DENV during continues years
showed that endemic infection of dengue circulating
locally may be also the important cause of Dengue

epidemic in southern China. In the study, two isolates
(CN.GD01/97 and CN.GD99/99) clustered together as a
new Asia-4 clade (Figure 1B), suggesting that the isolates of 1999 maybe originated from the isolates of
1997. Sequence analysis showed that the DENV-1
strains isolated during the 2003 epidemic were closely
related to the strains isolated during the 2002 epidemic
of Guangzhou, suggesting that the 2002 strains had
evolved in local and eventually cause the epidemic of
2003 (Figure 1B). Similar case was also showed in
Guangzhou outbreak of DF in 2006. The DENV-1 strain
isolated during the 2006 epidemic is closely related to
the strains isolated during the 2001 epidemic (Figure
1B). It suggested that DENV probably circulated in local
and caused the epidemics of 2001 and 2006. Moreover,
there were several clear divisions within the Chinese
2006 isolates in the tip of the tree, even the eight strains
collected in Guangzhou city by us during the epidemic of
DENV-1 in 2006 also clustered into 2 subclades in Asia 3
clade, showing viral evolution or increase of genetic
complexity even during a single epidemic (Figure 1B).
Recombination plays a role in dengue virus evolution
and adaptation [7]. We analyzed the potential recombination events of all the Chinese isolates (43 DENV-1,20
DENV-2,2 DENV-3,5 DENV-4) on E gene. Three
recombinant events were detected on the E gene of
DENV-1 with low P-value (P < 0.01) (Table 2). The
incongruence of phylogenetic trees constructed separately by recombinant regions and non-recombinant
regions confirmed the recombinant events (Figure 3).
The recombination event 1 showed recombination
between present GD14/97 isolate [GenBank: AY376737]
as the major parent and the GD95/95 isolate [GenBank:
FJ196846] as the minor parent, which led to a recombinant isolate of GD23/95 [GenBank: AY373427](Figure
3A). The recombination event 2 showed recombination
between present NHD98039/98 isolate [GenBank:
EF508198] as the major parent and the GZ02/03 isolate
[GenBank: DQ211349] as the minor parent, which led
to two recombinant isolates of GD01/97 [GenBank:
FJ196847] and GD99/99 [GenBank: FJ196848](Figure
3B). The recombination event 3 showed recombination
between present STD06098/06 isolate [GenBank:
EF508206] as the major parent and the 71/02 isolate
[GenBank: EF025110] as the minor parent, which led to
a recombinant isolate of GZ01/04 [GenBank: EF032589]
(Figure 3C). These studies of recombination provided an
important context to understand the evolution of these
viruses and sequence diversity generated in viruses in
China.
We also analyzed the potential recombination across
the 32 complete ORF of all the Chinese isolates, and
found no inter-serotype recombination occurred. The
results are coincided with previous data [8,10,32].

triangle indicate the sequences of recombinant, major parent and minor parent, respectively. The trees are mid-rooted for clarity.

However, we found 22 intra-serotype potential recombination events (17 for DENV-1, 5 for DENV-2) (Table 3).
Interestingly, for DENV-1, 13 of 17 potential recombination events happened in the strains isolated in 1995,
1997 and 1999 epidemics (Table 3), prior to which, in

1995, the severest dengue outbreak ever reported, indicating a possibility of viruses escaping human immunity
by recombination following epidemic. However, whether
the presumption makes sense or just a coincidence
remains an open question.

†

= 22 final recombination events resulting from at least two methods confirmation integrated in RDP3 package with a multiple comparison corrected P-value <
0.01 and one-by-one manual checking. Only the closest major and minor parental sequences were shown in the table. Recombinants of DENV-1 were bolded for
clarity.
* = The actual breakpoint position is undetermined (it was most likely overprinted by a subsequent recombination event).
Minor Parent = Parent contributing the smaller fraction of sequence.
Major Parent = Parent contributing the larger fraction of sequence.
Unknown = Only one parent and a recombinant need be in the alignment for a recombination event to be detectable.

Conclusions
Our study suggested that Dengue fever epidemic in
Southern China over the past 30 years presents two
important modes, 1) imported-cases-induced endemic
prevalence; 2) endogenous epidemic outbreak with natural epidemic focuses. Recombination analysis showed
that recombination plays an important role in dengue
virus evolution and adaptation.
