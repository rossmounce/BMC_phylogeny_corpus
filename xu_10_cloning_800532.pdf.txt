Cloning and phylogenetic analyses of serine/
threonine kinase class defense-related genes in
a wild fruit crop ‘chestnut rose’
Qiang Xu*, Xiuxin Deng

Abstract
Background: Chestnut rose (Rosa roxburghii Tratt) is a promising wild fruit crop in Southwest China. However,
chestnut rose suffers from several important diseases such as powdery mildew and black spot. Cloning and
phylogenetic analysis of plant immunity related genes will strengthen the evolutionary knowledge of plant
immune system and will facilitate the utilization of candidate genes in disease resistance breeding programs.
Findings: Serine/threonine kinase (STK) genes, encoding one of the important proteins for defense signal
transduction, were cloned from ‘chestnut rose’. Fifteen STK sequences were obtained by degenerate PCR.
Sequence analysis showed that nine of them have continued open reading frames, and they are separated into
five classes based on sequence analysis. Interestingly, one of the classes (STK V) showed less than 40% similarity to
any other class, possibly representing new type genes from chestnut rose. Southern blotting analysis revealed that
the new type STK V genes are single copy, while all the other genes have several copies in the genome.
Phylogenetic analysis of STK genes from chestnut rose and 21 plant species revealed that most chestnut rose
genes show close relationship with Rosaceae homologs, while the STK V genes are rather ancient and form a
unique clade distantly from plant homologs.
Conclusions: We cloned nine STK genes from a wild fruit crop ‘chestnut rose’, of which a new type of STK genes
was identified. The new type STK genes exist as single copies in the genome, and they are phylogenetically distant
to plant homologs. The polymorphic STK genes, combined with other plant immunity genes, provide plenty of
resources to be utilized to defend against pathogens attack.

Background
Chestnut rose (Rosa roxburghii Tratt), a wild fruit crop in
Southwest China, belongs to Rosaceae family Rosa genus.
It has recently been labeled as one of the three promising
new fruit crops in China due to its fruit having high content of vitamin C (2000-3000 mg/100 g FW), displaying
high levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and
therefore is believed to have senescence-retarding and
cancer-preventing effects [1]. Unfortunately, chestnut
rose crops are suffering from powdery mildew disease.
After decades of breeding, an indigenous cultivar from
Guizhou province of China, Guinong No. 6, was discovered to be highly resistant to powdery mildew [2]. This
material provides an opportunity to investigate the

mechanism underlying the generation of the powdery
mildew resistance specificity in chestnut rose.
Plants rely on their innate immune system to defend
against pathogens. The immune system is composed of
three important steps, i.e. pathogen detection, signal transduction, and defense response initiation [3-5]. The pathogen detection protein, encoded by resistance (R) genes, can
recognize pathogen-produced effectors and will produce a
defense signal; the transmission and amplification of
defense a signal requires kinase genes in the plant cell;
finally the host initiates transcription of the defenseresponse gene including the pathogenesis-related (PR) gene
that can confer local or systemic resistance [4,6].
Among the component genes of plant immune system, most researches are focusing on R genes [7]. Many
R genes have now been cloned from a wide variety of
plant species, of which the largest class is belonging to

the nucleotide-binding site–leucine-rich repeats (NBSLRR) family [7,8]. The NBS domain is highly conserved
across plant species, this characteristic facilitated the
cloning of large number of sequences homologous to R
genes, and so-called “R gene candidates (RGCs)”, from
many plant species by degenerate PCR strategy. Comprehensive analysis of plant RGCs have revealed that
several important molecular events including duplication, recombination, mutation, strong balancing selection, diversifying selection, and meiotic instability occur
on plant R genes [9-11]. Compared with R genes,
research on other component genes of the plant
immune system were rather limited.
Serine/threonine protein kinase (STK) is one of the
important proteins responsible for defense signal transduction. The STK domain is the major constituent of the
tomato Pto gene which not only interacts with the avirulence proteins from Pseudomonas syringae, but also functions as a signal transduction mediator [12]. The STK
domain is also contained in the rice Xa21 gene which
confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae [13].
STK domains are conserved across plant species, and
have been isolated in several plant species by degenerate
PCR [14-16]. Genome-level analysis of kinase genes were
mainly carried out in Arabidopsis and rice [17-21]; and
evolutionary analysis revealed that ancient diversification
and rapid evolution occur on STK genes [22-24].
A great effort was taken to understand what happens
to the immune system in parallel with the generation of
the resistance specificity in the chestnut rose powdery
mildew resistance genotype Guinong No.6 in our Lab. A
total of 38 and 37 NBS-type resistance gene candidates
(RGCs) were cloned from the resistant and susceptible
genotype, respectively. Comparative analysis showed
that the RGCs are under rapid evolution and are polymorphic between resistant and susceptible genotypes
[25]. Moreover, genes corresponding to the defense
response including pathogenesis related 2 (PR2) and PR5
gene families were cloned; sequence polymorphisms
including single nucleotide differences and small insertion/deletions (InDel) were observed in these plant
immunity genes. Through analysis of these two kinds of
plant immunity genes, we discovered some information
on the chestnut rose immune system. However, knowledge on the defense-related kinase genes is lacking. This
prompted us to clone the STK kinase genes and investigate their sequence features, genomic status, and evolutionary characteristics in the chestnut rose powdery
mildew resistance genotype.

Methods
Plant materials

Guinong No.6, a powdery mildew-resistant cultivar was
used for STK genes cloning. Genomic DNA was

Page 2 of 8

extracted from 3 g samples of young leaves using a
CTAB protocol from our Lab [26].
Isolation of STK genes

Degenerate primers were designed according to Di
Gaspero and Cipriani [15] and Vallad et al., [14] targeted
to isolate Serine/threonine kinase (STK) genes. Their
sequences were: P3, TNGGNSANGGNGKNTTYGG; P8,
AARYCNBMIAAYRTNCTICTNGAY; P2R, ACNCCRAANGARTANACRTC; P8R, TCNGGKCIAKRTAN
CCNAKNGTNCC. PCRs were performed on a PTC-200
thermal cycler in a total volume of 50 μl consisting of 50
ng DNA, 5 μl 10× buffer (Promega), 5 μl 10 mM dNTP,
4 μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 2 μl of 10 μM primers and 2 units
of Taq polymerase (Promega). The cycling conditions
were as follows: 94°C 3 min followed by 32 cycles of 94°C
1 min, 55°C 1 min, 72°C 2 min. PCR products corresponding to the expected size were excised from the gel
and purified using a gel extraction column (Omega BioTek, USA). The obtained DNA fragments were cloned
into pMD18-T vector (Takara Bio Inc.). Recombinant
plasmid DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis. Each clone
was re-amplified with M13 universal primers and then
subject to restriction analysis using three restriction
endonucleases (TaqI, HaeIII, and HinfI). Based on the
restriction patterns, representative clones of each type
were used for sequencing with the Bigdye Terminator
V3.1 cycle sequencing kit on an ABI 3730 sequencer.
Southern blotting analysis

Southern blotting was performed according to Xu et al.,
[26]. Briefly, 10 μgenomic DNA of Rosa roxburghii cv.
Guinong No.6 and R. roxburghii cv. Guinong No.5 were
digested with three different restriction endonucleases
(i.e. HindIII, BamHI, and TaqI). Digests were separated
by electrophoresis in a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham). Hybridization was done at 65°C overnight. The stringency wash
conditions were as follows: twice in 2 × SSC/0.5% SDS
for 5 min at room temperature and once in 0.1 × SSC/
0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65°C. Membranes were exposed
to x-ray film at -80°C for 2-6 d.
Phylogenetic tree construction and tree similarity analysis

Phylogenetic analyses were carried out according to Xu
et al., [25]. Sequences from other plant species were
downloaded from GenBank, and the detailed information on the representative genes can be viewed in
Table 1. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX and
manually edited in GENEDOC http://www.psc.edu/
biomed/genedoc/. Neighbor-joining trees using Kimura’s
two-parameter model and maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees were constructed and bootstrap number
were calculated by heuristic search in PAUP* 4.0

Results

Figure 1 The PCR amplification of STK genes from chestnut
rose. The figure showed two samples: Lane 1, Rosa roxburghii cv.
Guinong No.6 which is resistant to powdery mildew disease; and
Lane 2, R. roxburghii cv. Guinong No.5 which is susceptible to
powdery mildew disease.

The cloning of serine/threonine kinase genes

With degenerate primer P3 and P2R pair, a band of
the predicted size (~550 bp) was observed after PCR
amplification with the DNA of powdery mildew resistant genotype (Guinong No.6) as a template (Fig. 1).
These expected fragments were excised from agarose
gel and cloned into the plasmid vector pMD18-T. A
total of 170 positive clones were picked and used for
screening by endonuclease restriction pattern. Thirty
unique clones were chosen for DNA sequencing, of
which 15 clones contained the primer sites. BLAST
analysis against GenBank database revealed that the 15
genes are highly homologous to serine/threonine
kinase (STK) genes (Table 1). Conceptual translations
of the above 15 sequences revealed the presence of
premature stop codons in six clones. These sequences

with in-frame stop codons are regarded as
pseudogenes. The remained nine sequences (named as
STK1-STK9 under Genbank accession number
AY583621-AY583629) were regarded as STK genes by
the presence of continue open reading frame (ORF)
and by characteristic motifs such as VYKGVL and
DVYSFG (Fig. 2).
For these nine sequences, nucleotide identity among
each clone pair was determined. The identity ranged from
34-99%, with the highest occurred between STK3 and
STK4. The similarity of the deduced amino-acid of these
nine sequences was also calculated (Table 2). Clones with
greater than 85% similarity were grouped into a single
class, and this resulted the nine sequences into five classes

(designated as STK-I, STK-II, STK-III, STK-IV and
STK-V). Amino-acid similarity among the classes ranged
from 26% (STKI vs STKV) to 79% (STKII vs STKIV).
It is surprising that STKV class (including STK3 and
STK4 clones) showed less than 40% similarity to any
other class. BLAST analysis of the STK3 and STK4
clones against GenBank database revealed that they are
homologous to STK kinase gene with E-values < e × 10-21,
also the primer sites were contained in the two clones,
assuring that they are STK kinase genes. The low similarity may suggest that STKV class is a new type of STK
genes in chestnut rose genome.

Southern blotting of chestnut rose STK genes

Southern analysis of the chestnut rose STK genes
revealed that the copy number of different genes varied
greatly (Fig. 3). A number of copies were observed for
STK1 and STK5 genes; while STK3, the new type of
STK gene in chestnut rose genome, only had a single
copy in the chestnut rose genome. Furthermore, no
polymorphisms were detected between the powdery mildew resistant/susceptible genotypes using 3 probed
genes (STK1, STK3, and STK5), as revealed by Fig. 3.
This data indicated that different STK genes have different hybridization pattern but each STK gene was conserved among chestnut rose genotypes.
Phylogenetic profile of chestnut rose STK genes

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using PAUP software according to Xu et al., [25]. The phylogenetic tree
showed that chestnut rose nine STK genes were separated into five distinct clades (STKI-STKV), consistent
with the similarity based amino-acid sequence analysis
as described previously (Fig. 4).

Page 5 of 8

Evolutionary relationship among chestnut rose STK
genes and other known STK genes was further evaluated
by phylogenetic analysis. Amino acid sequences of
chestnut rose STK genes were used as a query in
BLASTp searches against GenBank database for possible
homologues in other plants species. The top 100
sequences were selected, and highly homologous
sequences (> 85% identity) within a plant species were
used to choose a representative sequence for further
analysis. A total of 30 STK genes from 21 plant species
were used in this study. The phylogenetic tree indicated
that chestnut rose STK genes distributed in four clades;
one was near to Platanus × acerifolia homolog, the second was neighbor to Vitis vinifera, the third was neighbor to Fragaria, and the final formed a distinct clade far
from plant species but closely related with drosophila
homolog gene (Fig. 5). These data suggested that the
STK genes in chestnut rose are ancient with multiorigins.

Discussion
Defense against pathogens involves three important
steps: pathogen detection, signal transduction, and
initiation defense response [4]. Most of the previous
molecular studies focus on the pathogen detection R
gene [10,11,27]. In this study, we characterized STK
genes which encode kinase proteins responsible for the
signal transduction during defense response. The genes
from the relative wild fruit tree ‘chestnut rose’ showed
close phylogenetic relationship to those from Rosaceae
homologs after phylogenetic analysis of the STK genes
from 21 plant species; however, some genes are a new
type from chestnut rose. For example, STK3 and STK4
formed a unique clade which cannot be clustered with
homolog genes from plants (Fig. 5). This indicates that
from this wild fruit tree most of the STK genes are
ancient and conserved, but with few plant-specific genes.

with HindIII. DNA size markers (ë/HindIII) are indicated to the left of
the image.

A total of 15 STK sequences were obtained from chestnut rose, of them nine have continue open reading
frame. The nine genes have been separated into five
classes based on both sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses. Four of the five classes were belonging to
known STK kinases, while the remained one class
(STKV) represents a new type. The STK3 and STK4
genes (member of STKV class) showed less than 40%
similarity to any other gene, and phylogenetic analysis
showed that STKV class formed a unique clade which is
more related with drosophila pelle gene than plant species STK genes. The low similarity observed among
STKV class with other four STK classes is not rare case
for plant immunity genes. For example, resistance (R)
gene, the other component of plant immune system,

sometimes showed low sequence similarities. Resistance
gene candidates (RGCs) sequence similarity ranged from
27 to 50% in Zingiber [28] and 19-44% in lettuce [29].
These data suggests that STK gene, as well as R genes,
may exist in the genome long history and have diversified greatly during the long history evolution.
Defense system in chestnut rose and its evolution

From a powdery mildew resistant genotype of chestnut
rose, the component gene of immune system, i.e. R-like
gene, kinase genes, PR genes, are all cloned [25,26,30].
In this study, we observed that STK2 and STK8 genes
showed a close relationship with Pto Resistance gene,
possibly indicated that they are candidate genes involved
in the defense system in chestnut rose. When considering with the previous studies together, we found that for
each plant immunity component gene many polymorphic members exist in the chestnut rose genome.
This suggests that in the chestnut rose genome there is
a sufficient resource of immunity genes utilized by
plants to defend against pathogen attacks. Evolutionary
analysis of these immunity genes also provided some
clues on the complexity of plant immune system. Diversifying selection has been detected on RGC genes [25];
and for PR2 genes diversifying selection is predominant
[30] in chestnut rose. The genes under diversifying

selection are believed to have strong function in the
defense, suggesting that in chestnut rose PR2 and R
genes are actively involved in the immune responses
which also require kinase gene for defense signaling.
However, the immune system located in the plant cell is
more complex than we can imagine. For example, there
are more than 300 defensin-like genes in Arabidopsis
[31]; many kinase genes such as Calmodulin-like domain
protein kinases (CDPKs), and MAP kinases (MAPKs)
were reported to be involved in defense activities [3,32].
Thus, plants can utilize enough strategies to defend
against a pathogen invasion during the long time
history.

Conclusions
From a wild fruit crop ‘chestnut rose’, serine/threonine
kinase (STK) genes were cloned by degenerate PCR. Fifteen STK sequences were isolated, and nine of them
have continued to open reading frames, and they are
separated into five classes based on sequence analysis.
One of the classes (STK V) showed less than 40% similarity to any other new type of STK genes, and these
new type STK genes exist as single copies in the genome, and they are phylogenetically related with animal
homologs rather than plant homologs. The polymorphic
STK genes, combined with other plant immunity genes,
