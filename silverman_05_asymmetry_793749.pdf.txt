Abstract
Background: The histone fold is a common structural motif of proteins involved in the chromatin
packaging of DNA and in transcription regulation. This single chain fold is stabilized by either homoor hetero-dimer formation in archaea and eukarya. X-ray structures at atomic resolution have
shown the eukaryotic nucleosome core particle to consist of a central tetramer of two bound H3H4 dimers flanked by two H2A-H2B dimers. The c-terminal region of the H3 histone fold involved
in coupling the two eukaryotic dimers of the tetramer, through a four-fold helical bundle, had
previously been shown to be a region of reduced burial of hydrophobic residues within the dimers,
and thereby provide a rationale for the observed reduced stability of the H3-H4 dimer compared
with that of the H2A-H2B dimer. Furthermore, comparison between eukaryal and archaeal
histones had suggested that this asymmetry in the distribution of hydrophobic residues along the
H3 histone chains could be due to selective evolution that enhanced the coupling between the
eukaryotic dimers of the tetramer.
Results and discussion: The present work describes calculations utilizing the X-ray structures
at atomic resolution of a hyperthermophile from Methanopyrus kandleri (HMk) and a eukaryotic
transcription factor from Drosophila melanogaster (DRm), that are structurally homologous to the
eukaryotic (H3-H4)2 tetramer. The results for several other related structures are also described.
Reduced burial of hydrophobic residues, at the homologous H3 c-terminal regions of these
structures, is found to parallel the burial at the c-terminal regions of the H3 histones and is,
thereby, expected to affect dimer stability and the processes involving histone structural
rearrangement. Significantly different sequence homology between the two histones of the HMk
doublet with other archaeal sequences is observed, and how this might have occurred during
selection to enhance tetramer stability is described.

Background
The histone fold [1] is a commonly conserved structural
motif found in proteins that interact with DNA [2-6]. This
monomeric fold consists of a helix-strand-helix motif stabilized by dimer formation. X-ray structures at atomic resolution, in either the absence [1] or presence of DNA [7],

have shown the octamer of the eukaryotic nucleosome to
be composed of histone dimers in a "handshake conformation" [1], with the H3-H4 dimers coupled forming a
central tetramer flanked by two H2A-H2B dimers.

The dimers of the tetramer are bound by a tenuous fourfold helical bundle that involves residues over the c-terminal regions of the H3 histone folds. Consequently, side
chain orientations in these regions while contributing to
tetramer stability do not contribute to the stability of the
dimers in the tetramer conformation by optimally burying residues within the dimer interiors. Such orientations,
if comparably maintained in the isolated dimers would,
therefore, reduce dimer stability relative to that of dimers
that are not required to perform such dual role of hydrophobic burial, namely, burial with respect to the interface
between dimers as well as with respect to the dimer interiors. This has been proposed [8] as a rationale for the
observed [9] reduced stability of the H3-H4 dimer compared with that of the H2A-H2B dimer.
X-ray structures at atomic resolution of an ancestral
nuclear protein histone of the hyperthermophile, HMk,
from Methanopyrus kandleri [10] and of the amino-terminal portions of the TFIID transcription factor TATA boxbinding associated factors (TAFIIs), dTAFII42 and
dTAFII62, from Drosophila, DRm [11], have been found to
be structurally homologous to the eukaryotic (H3-H4)2
tetramer. Since the unusual fold of the hyperthermophile
contains two histone fold motifs arranged in tandem
within a single chain [10,12], its structure, homologous to
the eukaryotic tetramer, is a dimer. The coupling of the
HMk monomers and TFIID dimers that yield the higherorder dimeric and tetrameric structures, respectively,
involves a four-fold helical bundle as does the (H3-H4)2
tetramer. Since the c-terminal region of the H3 histone
fold involved in coupling the two eukaryotic nucleosomal
dimers of the tetramer through the four-fold helical bundle had previously been shown [8] to be a region of
reduced burial of hydrophobic residues within the H3-H4
dimers, it is of interest to investigate the burial of hydrophobic residues over the homologous c-terminal regions
of the HMk monomer and DRm dimer. Reduced stability
of these lower-order structures, due to the burial of hydrophobic residues within the four-fold helical bundles,
holds implications for dynamical processes involving
DNA as well for nucleosome assembly.
Calculations have, therefore, been performed for structures of the HMk monomer and DRm dimer, as performed previously for archaeal methanogens and
eukaryotic nucleosomal dimers [8]. An interesting pattern
emerges. All chains involved in the coupling of the lowerorder structures, e.g. the HMk monomers and DRm dimers that yield dimers and tetramers, respectively, exhibit a
difference in the burial of hydrophobic residues along
their length. Reduced burial in the lower-order structures
arises from the region of the coupling, namely, the region
of the four-fold helical bundle. While these results are
consistent with the difference in burial of hydrophobic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/5/20

residues from the n- to c-terminal regions of the H3 histone chains of the nucleosome, the magnitudes of the burial over the homologous c-terminal regions of the HMk
and DRm chains are found to be less than that of the H3
magnitudes. On the other hand, all eukaryotic chains that
are not involved in the helical coupling yielding the
tetramers, do not exhibit such difference in hydrophobic
burial of residues along their length.
From a structural perspective, one expects the H3 histone
to play a key role in organizing the nucleosome. From an
evolutionary perspective, the n-terminal histone of HMk
is clearly cast in that role [13]. While the archaeal n-terminal histone of HMk is found to exhibit little or no
sequence homology with other archaeal histones, BLAST2
as well as PSI-BLAST searches, show the c-terminal histone, the histone structurally homologous with the H4
eukaryotic histone, to exhibit significant homology with
other archaeal histones. How selection, involving the nterminal histone of HMk, to enhance tetramer stability
could have evolved within the context of such dichotomy
is described.
Early recognition of the homology between the sequences
of the Drosophila transcription factor and the eukaryotic
H3 and H4 histones had suggested [14] the presence of a
histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID that
would interact with DNA in a manner similar to that of
the histone octamer. Subsequent investigations [15,16]
have provided chromatographic evidence suggesting the
presence of a TAF octamer within the TFIID initiation
complex. Comparisons of the structural and sequence
homology between the tetramers of HMk, DRm and the
eukaryotic H3 and H4 histones show, as expected, that the
structures and sequences of species belonging to the same
domain align more closely than those belonging to different domains. While the HMk dimer appears to be structurally homologous to the eukaryotic tetramer, a detailed
analysis highlights differences.

Methods
Calculations have been performed utilizing the PDB structures of the histone monomer and dimer of the ancestral
hyperthermophile from Methanopyrus kandleri, HMk [10]
(PDB id 1F1E) and the eukaryotic transcription TATA boxbinding associated factors (TAFIIs) dTAFII42 and dTAFII62
from Drosophila melanogaster, DRm [11] (PDB id 1TAF),
respectively. Only the structural segments with histone
fold motifs, i.e., the helix-strand-helix-strand-helix substructure segments as defined by the PDB files are
extracted and used in the calculations. The HMk single
chain is thus clipped in the middle and the HMk structure
then appears as a histone dimer. The histone nearest the
n-terminal end of the HMk monomer will be simply
called the "first histone". The histone nearest the c-termi-

BMC Structural Biology 2005, 5:20

nal end of the monomer will be called the "second histone". Consequently the n-terminal region of the HMk
monomer may be referred to as the n-terminal region of
the first histone and the c-terminal region of the HMk
monomer referred to as the c-terminal region of the second histone. Dependent upon the context of discussion,
the HMk monomer may be referred to as an HMk dimer
and the dimer referred to as a tetramer. This terminology
supplements that used previously [10] enabling a more
unequivocal and parallel description of the histone
homologies between HMk and other species. The "c-terminal region" of the first HMk histone is then the region
involved in the four-fold helical coupling that binds the
HMk dimers of the tetramer. This region is structurally
homologous with the c-terminal region of the H3 eukaryotic histone. One might have been tempted to label the
two segments of HMk, domain1 and domain2. Since this
protein nomenclature is usually reserved for units that
appear to fold independently and the histone fold is stabilized by dimerization, we have not used this terminology. The dimer of the eukaryotic Drosophila melanogaster
transcription factors, dTAFII42 and dTAFII62 will be
referred to as the DRm dimer. Consistent with previous
usage [10], the hyperthermophile Methanopyrus kandleri
will be referred to as HMk. The HMk dimer (tetramer) and
the DRm tetramer may be referred to as the higher-order
structures, collectively.
Calculations have also been performed on the archaeal
histone dimer, HPha from Pyrococcus horikoshii [17], and
on two other histone-like transcription associated factor
(TAF) dimeric structures. One is from the hetero-trimeric
transcription factor, NF-Y [18] (PDB id 1N1J), and the
other is from the ternary complex of the negative cofactor
2, NC2 [19] (PDB id 1JFI)). The results of calculations performed on these structures for which structural homology
with the eukaryotic tetramer is not expected, are useful for
comparison with the results obtained for the HMk and
DRm structures.
The present calculations, which provide a measure of residue distance from the interior of the dimers, and consequently, correlation coefficients between these distances
and residue hydrophobicities, are based upon the residue
side-chain locations. The center-of-geometry of the ith residue, or residue centroid, ri , is calculated with inclusion
of only the backbone α – carbon atom and exclusion of
the hydrogen atoms. This distribution of points in threedimensional space enables calculation of the geometric
center of the distribution, rc , namely, the centroid of all
residue side-chain centroids of the protein. This will be
called the "center-of-the-protein".

to the protein surface.

distance from the center-of-the-protein to the residue centroid [20].
The scale of residue hydrophobicity chosen is that of Neumaier [21]. This scale provided greater correlation
between residue hydrophobicity and ellipsoidal distance
than a number of other scales initially considered. Calculations are only performed on the histone folds when in
the conformation of the dimer. Consequently the residue
distances obtained from the calculations are distances
from the center of the dimer. This enables an examination
of how the burial of residue hydrophobicity within the
four-fold helical bundle trades-off against such burial
within the interior of the dimer. The degree of such tradeoff is quantitatively mirrored by the correlation coefficient
between residue distances from the dimer interior and residue hydrophobicities.

A number of web based programs, i.e., PSI-BLAST [22],
BLAST2 [23], CE [24] and CONSURF [25] have been used
in examining the homology between the histones of HMk
and DRm with other archaeal and eukaryal sequences.

Results and discussion
This distance, which will be called the ellipsoidal distance,
is used in the calculations. It is just the value of the principal major axis of the ellipsoid upon which the residue
centroid is found. It has been shown to correlate more
closely with residue solvent accessibility than the radial

(PDB id 1EQZ) and Saccharomyces cerevisae [28] (PDB id
1ID3) species had been used in the calculations. The correlation coefficients are provided for the entire histone
chain as well as for the n- and c-terminal halves of the
chain. Figure 1 highlights the c-terminal regions of the A
and E chains of the H3 histones of the 1KX5 structure
involved in the four-fold helical coupling that binds the
dimers of the tetramer. Residues in these regions comprise
a majority of the residues of the c-terminal halves of the
chains. Table 1 shows significant reduction in correlation
coefficient between amino acid distance from the center
of the dimer and hydrophobicity over the c-terminal
halves of the H3 chains of the three species compared
with their n-terminal halves. The c-terminal regions of the
H3 histone folds are regions of reduced burial of hydrophobic residues within the dimers and thereby provide a
rationale for the observed reduced stability of the H3-H4
dimer compared with that of the H2A-H2B dimer [9].
Tables 1 and 2 also show that histones not involved in the
four-fold helical coupling yielding the higher order tetrameric structures, namely, H4, H2A, and H2B, do not
exhibit the extent of differential burial of hydrophobic
residues over their chain-lengths as found for the H3
histones.
Table 3 shows the correlation coefficients between the histone amino acid residue distances from the interior of the
dimers and their values of residue hydrophobicity for the
histones of the Gallus gallus [1] (PDB id 2HIO) nucleosomal structure in the absence of DNA. One notes that the
differential burial along the H3 chain is maintained as
well as the distinction in values between species. It would
be of interest to see if such differences are comparably
maintained for the isolated dimers. If so, this would support the contention [8] that the difference in hydrophobic
residue burial along the H3 histone chain is responsible
for the difference in stability observed between the H3-H4
and H2A-H2B dimers in solution [9]. X-ray structures at
atomic resolution have previously been obtained [29] for
the individual homodimers of the A and B histones of the
Methanothermus fervidus hyperthermophilic archaeon. In
the presence of DNA, these dimers form tetramers [30]
which are structurally homologous to the H3 and H4
eukaryotic nucleosomal tetramer.

Table 4 lists the correlation coefficients for the archaea.
This includes results obtained for the x-ray structures [29]
of the archaeal histones, HMfA (PDB id: 1B67) and HMfB
(PDB id: 1A7W) of Methanothermus Fervidus While the difference in the correlation coefficients between residue distance and hydrophobicity from the n- to c-terminal
regions of HMfA and HMfB is comparable with the difference from the n- to c-terminal regions of the eukaryotic
H3 histones, the magnitude of burial over the homologous c-terminal regions is significantly less for the
archaea. This difference in the burial of hydrophobic residues from the n- to c-terminal regions of the HMfA and
HMfB archaeal chains can also be visually discerned from
the asymmetry in values of the longer wavelength variations in hydrophobicity along the HMfA and HMfB
sequences as seen in figure 8 of reference 8. Table 4 also
lists the correlation coefficients for the histone chains of
the HMk and HPhA hyperthermophiles. The HMk chain
as well as the chain of HPhA show comparable differential
burial of residues from the n- to c-terminal regions over
their length as found for the methanogens, HMfA and
HMfB.
HMk is particulary interesting for a number of reasons.
First, the HMk monomer differs from the HMf and
eukaryotic histones by containing two histone fold motifs
in a single chain. Such anomaly is one of a number of
strange properties exhibited by this archaeon [12,31,32].
Second, this monomeric doublet forms a dimer in the
crystal [10] that appears to be structurally homologous to
the (H3-H4)2 tetramer of the eukaryotic nucleosome. Gel

also indicated that in the absence of DNA the dominant
form of HMk in solution is a stable dimer [33]. Furthermore, even though the two histones of HMk exhibit 28%
sequence identity, they are exceedingly different in one
respect. The first histone is distantly related to other
known Archaeal sequences in the Swiss-Prot database,
whereas the second histone has many close Archaeal
neighbors in this database. Figure 2 shows the results of a
BLAST2 search [23] of these two different histones.
Interestingly, the closest hits of the first histone are four
mammalian TATA box-binding proteins. The remaining
Archaeal correspondences obtained are six-orders of
magnitude greater in E-value than those obtained
between the second histone and other Archaeal proteins
in the data base. A PSI-BLAST search [22] reduces this dif-

ference to two-orders of magnitude; however, the four
mammalian TATA box-binding proteins remain as nearest
neighbors of the first histone. Figure 3 illustrates the segregated alignments of the two histones. The BLAST2
search [23] has been performed for the entire sequence of
the doublet histone monomer. The color coded matches
are shown along the full sequence. The four most distant
correspondences of the ten shown are between the TATA
box-binding proteins and the first histone.
Perhaps the most dramatic way to exhibit this difference
between the two HMk histones is achieved by displaying
the conservation of their amino acid residues. This is simply provided by a CONSURF analysis [25]. CONSURF
accepts a PDB file (in the present case, the 1F1E PDB file),

performs a PSI-BLAST sequence analysis and uses the
results to assign an integer amino acid conservation score
for each residue. The integer score is assigned a color
which can be used to paint the atoms of the PDB structure
and provide a visual display of amino acid conservation.
The greatest integers, 9 (maroon) and 8 (magenta), are
reserved for the most highly conserved residues. Figure 4

Early analyses of the 16S rRNA sequence of HMk placed it
close to the root of the Euryarchaeotic tree [31] while
more recent studies based on more extensive sets of
sequences [12,32] have grouped HMk with other archaeal
methanogens. From this latter observation, it thus comes as
a surprise that its genome appears to contain large numbers of
genes not present in the genomes of any of the other sequenced

archaeal methanogens and it contains the largest fraction of
genes for which function cannot automatically be assigned
based on sequence similarity [34]. Such equivocacy justifies
speculation regarding the phylogeny of the HMk monomer within the context of two very different scenarios; one
in which the HMk monomer evolved from a grouping
with other methanogenic histones and one from a lineage
in which it bore little resemblance to other archaeal
histones.
In the former scenario, the unique structural feature of
HMk, namely, the tandem repeat of two histones in a single chain may have been the result of gene fusion. This, as
well as other HMk unique protein fusions and splittings
have been observed [12,31,32,34,35]. Reduced sequence
homology between the first histone and other archaeal
and eukaryotic H3 histones, from that observed with the
HMf methanogens, may have resulted from gene duplication and subfunctionalization involving the n-terminal
HMk histone. Relaxed constraints [13] combined with the
selective pressures exerted by the extreme environment of
the HMk organism could have enhanced tetramer stability
at the cost of sequence homology with other methanogens. This is not inconsistent with the general observation
that structurally related proteins need not be related in
sequence. Significant modifications in sequence are, also,
consistent with the high evolutionary rate inferred for this
archaeon by a phylogenetic analysis of HMk's transcription apparatus [32]. Sequence homology between the cterminal or second histone of HMk with the other
archaeal histones would be relatively maintained. Figure
5 shows the close ClustalW alignment [36] between the
sequence of the second histone and that of the methanogen, HMfA. The second HMk histone also aligns most
closely with the H4 histones, which is consistent with

H4's role of remaining constant throughout eukaryotic
evolution.
For the second scenario, the ancestral HMk histones
would have had little resemblance to other archaeal histones and differences between the first HMk histone and
other archaeal histones would thereby be accounted for.
Selection, however, would still have yielded the helices
and structures required to wrap DNA and to bury the
appropriate hydrophobic residues required to couple the
monomers yielding structurally homologous dimers to
the eukaryotic tetramers. Homology between the
sequence of the second histone and other archaeal
sequences as well as with the H4 eukaryotic histone would
now require explanation. This homology could have been
the result of lateral gene transfer (LGT). Such transfers
have been found to occur; for example, the RNA polymerase subunit H of HMk has been apparently replaced by a
protein from a distantly related protein of archaeal lineage
[32]. This particular transfer is strongly supported by the
observation of a well conserved insert of five or six amino
acid residues shared only by the RNA polymerase subunits
H from M. kandleri and Thermoplasmatales. Interestingly,
the nearest BLAST2 [23] neighbor of the second histone of
HMk is an archaeal histone of Methanobacterium formicicum. This histone and the second HMk histone share five
identical amino acids that span the fold coupling the final
two c-terminal histone helices. So, to summarize, either
phylogenetic scenario would be consistent with the differences observed between the two histone sequences of
HMk that had occurred during selection to enhance

histones are comparable. The differential asymmetry in
the burial of hydrophobic residues from the n- to c-terminal ends of the HMk and HPhA chains is also comparable.
For the HPhA dimers as for the HMf dimers, one might
expect this bias to have been a consequence of selection
that assisted in the coupling of the dimers to form tetramers while in the presence of DNA.
Table 5 lists the correlation coefficients for three histonelike dimers from the transcription factors of, TFIID [11],
NF_Y [18] (PDB id; 1N1J), and NC2 [19] (PDB id 1JFI).

The asymmetry of burial of hydrophobic residues from
the n- to c-terminal region of the A chain of the 1TAF
structure is comparable in magnitude with that found for
the Archaea. This is consistent with the role played by this
chain in binding the dimers of the tetramer. Such asymmetric burial is not observed for the B chain of the 1TAF
structure. These observations are consistent with the
homologies, originally identified [37,38] between the A
and B chain sequences of the 1TAF PDB structure with the
eukaryotic H3 and H4 histone sequences, respectively. As
had been previously noted [18,19], the A and B chains of

the histone-like structures of 1N1J and 1JFI more closely
resemble the H2A and H2B histones than the H3, and H4
histones. Consequently differential burial along the chain
lengths of these histone-like structures is not expected and
the values of their correlation coefficients listed in Table 5
support this contention.
Major interest in the1TAF and 1F1E structures is a result of
their apparent structural homology with the eukaryotic
(H3-H4)2 tetramer. Both of these histones, however, differ
in at least two respects. First, Drosophila melanogaster,
DRm, is a member of the eukaryotic domain, whereas
Methanopyrus kandleri, HMk, belongs to the archaeal
domain and consequently at a greater phylogenetic
distance from the eukaryotic structures. Secondly, the
results of sequence alignments and BLAST2 [23] searches
are very different for these two histone structures. The
sequence of the A chain of 1TAF does resemble the nucleosomal H3 sequence and a BLAST2 [23] search, in contrast with the search of the first HMk sequence, turns up
numerous related sequences. A detailed comparison of
the apparently homologous HMk and DRm tetrameric
structures is, therefore, of interest.

Figure 6 shows ribbon diagrams of the three homologous
tetrameric structures. They appear as inverted V-shaped
shaped structures. From the figure it is seen that the arms
of the V of HMk (figure 6c) are drawn together more
closely than the arms of the eukaryotic structures (figures
6a and 6b). Closing the arms of the HMk structure places
the c-terminal ends of the chains, homologous to the H4
eukaryotic chains, in close proximity. This proximity of
the amino acids at the c-terminal ends of the HMk chains
apparently contributes to the stability of the tetramer [10].
Figure 7 shows a wire diagram of the 1F1E and 1TAF αcarbon atom locations, CE [24] aligned with those of the
eukaryotic 1KX5 structure. Only chains involved in the
four-fold helical binding of the tetramer are shown. CE
alignment is achieved by coupling the pairs of chains
homologous to the H3 chains, as well as the H3 chains.
Note that the alignment between the two eukaryotic structures is within the alignment threshold for the CE chain
extension cut-off; consequently the chains are completely
aligned. The RMSD between the alpha-carbon atom coordinates over the entire chain is 2.9 Angstroms with a
sequence identity of 21 %. The CE alignment of the n-terminal histones of HMk with the H3 histones of 1KX5 is

not possible over the entire length of the two arms of the
structures, while still remaining below the CE threshold
for chain extension. The longer length of HMk chain that
is below this threshold is demarcated by the dashed line
in figure 7. Over this aligned region, the RMSD is 2.7 Angstroms with a sequence identity of 8 %. Therefore, while
the structure of the archaeal HMk dimer appears to be globally homologous with the tetrameric structure of the
eukaryotic nucleosome and transcription factor, it exhibits well defined differences in structure as well as in
sequence.

is found to be homologous to numerous other archaeal
histones in the Swiss-Prot database. How selection may
have enhanced the stability of the tetramer by modifications that would be consistent with this difference
between the two HMk histones has been described within
the context of two different phylogenetic scenarios. The
limited amount of data, however, makes these speculations tentative. It will be interesting to see how the story
evolves as further structures are determined.

Conclusion
The present investigation was predominantly motivated
by the availability of structures at atomic resolution of the
histone dimer of the archaeal hyperthermophile, HMk,
and the histone-like tetramer of the eukaryotic transcription factor of Drosophila melanogaster, DRm. The asymmetry in burial of hydrophobic residues along the lengths of
the histone chains of these structures was investigated as
well as sequence and structural homology with other
archaeal and eukaryotic, nucleosomal and transcription
factor histones. Whereas previous studies have emphasized structural similarities between the HMk histone
dimer and eukaryotic tetramers, the present study has
emphasized differences in structure as well as in sequence.
The calculations show that the histone chains of the Drosophila transcription factor involved in the helical
coupling that yield the tetramer, exhibit the asymmetry in
the burial of hydrophobic residues previously observed
for the homologous histone chains of the nucleosome.
The magnitude of the burial over the c-terminal region of
the A chain of the 1TAF structure is, however, less compared with that calculated for the chains of the
nucleosomal proteins. On the other hand, all eukaryotic
chains investigated that are not involved in such four-fold
helical coupling, whether from the histone-like structures
of transcription factors or from the histones of the
nucleosome, do not exhibit this asymmetry. Consequently, while contributing to an instability or reduction
in the binding of the lower order structures, the asymmetry may also provide a marker for the presence of higher
order multimers currently unobserved.
The archaeal HMk histones have also been shown to
exhibit the moderate asymmetry in residue burial comparable with that found for other archaeal histones and for
the histones of the 1TAF structure. On the other hand, the
histones of the HMk dimer that are involved in the fourfold helical coupling of the monomers, namely, the n-terminal histones of the monomer, have been shown to have
questionable sequence and structural homology with
archaeal and eukaryotic histones. The HMk histone not
involved in such coupling, namely the c-terminal histone,
