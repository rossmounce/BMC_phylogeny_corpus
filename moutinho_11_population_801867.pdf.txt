Population dynamics, structure and behavior of
Anopheles darlingi in a rural settlement in the
Amazon rainforest of Acre, Brazil
Paulo Rufalco Moutinho1, Luis Herman Soares Gil2, Rafael Bastos Cruz2 and Paulo Eduardo Martins Ribolla1*

Abstract
Background: Anopheles darlingi is the major vector of malaria in South America, and its behavior and distribution
has epidemiological importance to biomedical research. In Brazil, An. darlingi is found in the northern area of the
Amazon basin, where 99.5% of the disease is reported.
Methods: The study area, known as Ramal do Granada, is a rural settlement inside the Amazon basin in the state
of Acre. Population variations and density have been analysed by species behaviour, and molecular analysis has
been measured by ND4 mitochondrial gene sequencing.
Results: The results show higher density in collections near a recent settlement, suggesting that a high level of
colonization decreases the vector presence. The biting activity showed higher activity at twilight and major
numbers of mosquitos in the remaining hours of the night in months of high density. From a sample of 110
individual mosquitoes, 18 different haplotypes were presented with a diversity index of 0.895, which is higher than
that found in other Anopheles studies.
Conclusions: An. darlingi depends on forested regions for their larval and adult survival. In months with higher
population density, the presence of mosquitoes persisted in the second part of the night, increasing the vector
capacity of the species. Despite the intra-population variation in the transition to rainy season, the seasonal
distribution of haplotypes shows no change in the structure population of An. darlingi.

Background
Malaria is one of the most important tropical diseases in
the world. WHO data report a total of 106 malaria-endemic countries and 151 million estimated cases in 2009
[1]. In South America, there are a high number of disease
notifications in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Suriname and Bolivia. These countries have large tracts of
Amazon rainforest, South American biome and habitats
for many Anopheles species that have high potential to be
malaria vectors [2,3].
Brazil has the largest number of malaria cases and
malaria-related deaths in the Americas, and 15% of its
population lives in at-risk areas, which are concentrated
in the states of the Amazon Basin, with an average of 500
thousand notifications per year [4]. The strategies and

targets for malaria control include diagnosis, disease
treatment and prevention by mosquito control. Therefore, understanding the biology and behaviour of the
vector is extreme importance for efficient control of the
disease.
The main vectors of malaria in South America are: Anopheles albimanus, Anopheles darlingi and Anopheles
nuneztovari in Colombia [5,6]; An. darlingi and Anopheles
benarrochi in Peru [7,8]; An. darlingi in Bolivia [9]; An.
darlingi, Anopheles marajoara and Anopheles aquasalis in
Venezuela [10-12] and An. darling and An. aquasalis in
Brasil [13,14]. The presence of An. darlingi in the countries cited explains why it is the major target of most studies of malaria vector dynamics in the continent.
Anopheles darlingi is the major vector of malaria in
Brazil. There are two main factors that may have contributed to this ability: the species is highly susceptible to the
Plasmodium sp. that infect humans [15] and demonstrates anthropophilic behaviour [2,16]. With respect to

its biology and development, the larvae utilizes commonly water reservoirs close to houses as breeding
grounds: lakes, margin rivers, streams and flooding areas,
which are shaded or partly shaded, and mats of floating
debris and vegetation [17,18]. Human presence in the
Peruvian Amazon influences the creation of new breeding sites via impoundment and creation of large lakes for
fish farming [19].
Concerning seasonality, models differ according to the
area and their breeding pattern: riverines areas (dwelling
beside a river) with low anthropogenic action show low
An. darlingi densities during the dry season, which
increase a few months after the beginning of the rainy season, reaching their highest levels at the peak of this season.
For inland areas with high anthropogenic action, where
there is a greater presence of artificial breeding sites, the
water reserve tends to retain its capacity during the dry
seasons and the mosquito densities rise to high values by
the end of the rainy season, persisting at a high level in the
dry season [14,20-22]. Tadei [23] reported that low-lying
and flooded areas have numerous breeding sites and high
mosquito densities, and the dry and rainy seasons do not
have much effect on anopheline populations. Finally, some
studies still show that there are no correlations between
An. darlingi populations and rainfall, so this result might
be a consequence of the known variability in mosquito
abundance among localities [11,12].
The periods of biting activity are crepuscular and overnight, with peaks in the early hours of the evening; there
may be an extension of this activity during the night,
according to the season and to the vector’s population
density [3,24,25]. As for endophilic/exophilic behavior, it
is hypothesized that this feature changed because of the
introduction of control methods, which consist of the use
of indoor insecticides [26]. Early analysis of An. darlingi
showed the species to be endophilic, as after feeding on
blood, the females rested in the internal structure of the
house [27,28]. Recent studies show a behavior change,
where there was an increased presence of mosquitoes in
the peri-domicile, which is located outside the house but
close to it [3,14,25]. New prophylactic measures are
being studied, as is the use of repellents and insecticide
impregnated bed nets [29,30].
Various factors that change the habitat and performance of An. darlingi, mainly due to human interventions, have led us to research an intraspecies difference
between the populations. Forest degradation, increased
housing in the local forest and climate changes are strong
influences on Anopheles populations. Therefore, it is
necessary to obtain tools to identify and characterize the
intraspecies variability in An. darlingi.
For studies with An. darlingi, which has an extensive
geographic distribution, it is necessary that the marker
chosen provides a degree of polymorphism detectable

among individuals. The molecular marker contributes to
the understanding of the heterogeneity of the species,
clarifying the important information about the vector
and its population structure [31,32]. Wide use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing determines population structure in medical entomology [33-35]. The
mitochondrial genome consists of a small, circular molecule with conserved genetic content (only 37 genes) and
a simple genomic structure (maternal inheritance,
absence of recombination, small or absent intergenic
areas, absence of introns, repetitive DNA, pseudogenes
and transposable elements) [36]. The molecule evolves
about 5-10 times faster than the nuclear genes do
[36-38]. Constantly used in studies with Aedes aegypti
[39-41], this marker showed satisfactory results with An.
darlingi [42], which were high polymorphism and similar
indexes of nucleotide diversity from other mitochondrial
genes for neotropical anophelines [43,44].
The state of Acre is situated in the Amazon basin. In
2008, 9,410 malaria notifications were reported, with
8,595 occurring in rural settlements [4]. The study site of
this paper, the municipality of Acrelândia, represents a
risk area [45] and is the subject of several publications on
the Anopheles sp. [46-48]. The aim of this study was to
verify the behavior, distribution and population structure
of the major vector of the region, An. darlingi. The area
is subject to continually gradual changes of the geographic space, and this fact highly influences An. darlingi
dynamics.

Methods
Study Area

Acrelândia, 122 km from Rio Branco, is a small town
with approximately 12,000 inhabitants located in the
western state of Acre (Figure 1). The area has a history
of urbanization like other regions of the Amazon biome,
starting with the Rubber Boom in the early twentieth
century, followed by other extractive activities such as
the mining and lumber industries. Currently, agriculture
is the main factor responsible for the continued
deforestation.
The Ramal do Granada (Brazilian Federal Highway
364) is located in rural area of Acrelândia, and belongs to
the Pedro Peixoto Agricultural Settlement Project, a Settlement Program Directed (Programa de Assentamento
Dirigido - PAD) responsible for subdivision and land distribution in various uninhabited regions of the Brazil.
The Ramal do Granada (Figure 1) has a linear extension
of 30 km from point 0 (BR 364-highway) and includes
households along an unpaved road, with the economy
based on agriculture, mainly with livestock. The number
of homes and the degree of deforestation vary according
to the position along the road: the proportion of degradation that correlates with human actions can be assessed

via the linear distance from point 0. The tendency is this;
the farther from point 0, the lower the number of residents and the level of deforestation.
Considering this information, two sampling sites for
Anopheles adult were selected from Ramal do Granada
(Figure 1): km 24 (455ft; S09°44.542’; WO67°07.212’) and
km 30 (421 ft; S 09°41,247’; WO67°07,692). The km 24
represents the area with more degradation and higher
numbers of houses, and km 30 represents the area with
more recent occupation. Both sites have the following:
streams and water reserves; flooded areas; similar structure of the houses; and the presence of riparian forests
and pasture near the residences (Figure 2).
Mosquito collection

Each mosquito collection consisted of indoor and outdoor capture, composed of three consecutive days; 3hour captures at first and second day (km 24 and km 30

respectively) and 12-hour capture at the third day (only
km 30). The 3-hours capture occurred between 6:00 pm
and 9:00 pm and the 12-hours capture between 6:00 pm
and 6:00 am. The interval between 6:00 pm and 9:00
pm for the 3-hour capture was decided upon by consulting the literature, which reported the twilight behaviour of An. darlingi [3,24,25,49].
The weather conditions specific to each collection day
are listed in Table 1. Temperature and RAH are the average values from two digital thermo-hydrometers ITHT2000 (Instrutemp), located indoor and outdoor capture.
The rainfall values were obtained with the State Civil
Defense of Acre. Moon phases were collected in http://
www.moon-phases.net and the climatic condition were
noted during capture day. There was a concern with the
choices of the capture day, avoid events that change the
biting activity (rain, fogs, full moon), establishing a pattern of weather conditions for the collections.

The mosquitoes was captured using human bait, performed by the own authors. Following the seasonal variation of rainfall, five collections were conducted over
ten months: May, July, September and November 2008
and February 2009. Mosquitoes were identified using a
key species of the subgenus of Nyssorhynchus [50] and
preserved in 70% isopropyl alcohol.
Extraction, Amplification and Purification of mtDNA

For the extraction of mtDNA from An. darlingi, Chelex®
Molecular Biology Grade Resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories)

was used. DNA was extracted from mosquitoes individually, following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The
extracted DNA was quantified using an ND-1000 (Nanodrop) spectrophotometer and its purity was also checked.
Amplification reactions were conducted according to the
protocol of Gorrochotegui-Escalante with modifications
[51]. Amplification was done in a final volume of 40 ul,
using 2 ul of the DNA sample, 20 uL Gotaq Colorless
Master Mix (Promega), 12 uL ultrapure water (Aster) and
6 uL of oligonucleotides specific for the ND4 gene: 3uL of
ND4-F (5’-TGATTGCCTAAGGCTCATGT-3’) and 3uL

of ND4-R (5’-TTCGGCTTCCTAGTCGTTCAT-3’) (Invitrogen). Amplification reactions were performed in a
Whatman Biometra (T Gradient) thermocycler with temperature cycles of: three cycles of 94°C/2 min, 37°C/2 min,
and 72°C/1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C/30 s, 50°C/
30 s, and 72°C/1 min, with a final extension cycle of 72°C/
5 min. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were
subjected to electrophoresis through an agarose [52]. The
specific region of the ND4 gene that was amplified corresponds to nucleotides 8.519-8.880 in Aedes albopctus
[GenBank:AY072044], and has been used in other publications by our research group [40,42].
PCR products were purified using Montage PCR Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore), following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Sequencing mtDNA and Data Analysis

The purified PCR products and an aliquot of the oligonucleotides specific for the ND4 gene (10 pmol/L) were sent
to the bio-molecular company Macrogen (Seoul, South
Korea). Sequencing was conducted under BigDye Terminator Cycling Conditions. The reaction products were
purified using ethanol precipitation and run using the
Automatic Sequencer 3730XL. ND4 gene sequences were
analysed, as was the reaction efficiency of sequencing. A
fragment of 286 base pairs was used to compare the
sequences and for further analysis. These sequences were
aligned using Clustal W [53], and misaligned nucleotides
were manually adjusted. The program MEGA [54] was
used to perform phylogenetic and molecular analysis. Distance (Neighbor Joining, NJ) and parsimony methods were
used to construct phylogenetic trees [55] using the Kimura
2 parameters distance [56]. Nucleotide sequences and

haplotype frequencies were calculated using DnaSP
version 3.5 [57]. Genetic analysis of population differentiation, haplotype diversity index, and nucleotide diversity
were calculated with Arlequin 3.0 software [58] and a haplotype map was constructed by TCS, version 1.12.

Results
Mosquito Collections

A total of 3,486 mosquitoes were collected, with 2,982
(85.5%) being An. darlingi. Others Anopheles species
were also collected: Anopheles deaneorum, Anopheles
rangeli, Anopheles albitarsis, Anopheles braziliensis,
Anopheles triannulatus and Anopheles argyritarsis.
Table 2 depicts the distribution of An. darlingi, only
for the 3-hour capture. The collections show significant quantitative differences between the sites: km 24
showed a lower density of An. darlingi compared to
30 km, and the outdoor capture had the major number
of mosquitoes collected. The low value of the sample
at km 24, compared to 30 km, was observed for all of
the months.

The 12-hour captures shows a higher concentration of
An. darlingi at the first part of the night, with biting
activity starting at sunset. Figure 3 shows a pattern of
biting activity that alternates according the population
density. May 2008 indoor capture displayed a classic
bimodal cycle. For the May, July, September and
November outdoor captures, the occurrence is predominantly in the first part of the night. February 2009,
month with the highest population density, registered

biting activity until the early morning hours in both captures. 1,899 An. darlingi were collected in the twelvehour capture, with 73.6% being outdoor captures.

three days (3-hour capture at km 24, 3-hour capture at
km 30 and 12-hour capture) and shows the variation of
mosquitoes according to the study period. It is important to note this change; May to July 2008 there was an
observed decrease of precipitation, which followed the
decrease of An. darlingi; opening of the dry season and
diminution of temperature. September 2008 is the

month that best illustrates how the mosquito density
decreases during the dry season.
With the increase in precipitation and the rise in temperature marking the beginning of the rainy season.
November 2008 reflects this transition with a significant
increase of An. darlingi in relation to September. Lastly,

population until February. Pair-a-pair Fst comparisons
between populations (Table 4) shows that November
and February (Fst = 0,05, P < 0,01) is the only significant result.

Sequencing analysis of mtDNA

One hundred ten mosquitoes were sequenced: 30 from
July, 12 from September, 33 from November and 35
from February. Only An. darlingi indoor and outdoor
from km 30, the collection site that shows higher density, were chosen, thereby obtaining significant values
for the seasonal variation of species. The alignment of
these sequences showed the presence of 20 polymorphic
sites representing 18 different haplotypes. The populations showed an index of nucleotide diversity of π =
0.0127, and a haplotype diversity Hd = 0.895. A total of
20 mutations were identified, with 16 synonymous
mutations.
Analysis of sequences and the map of haplotypes by
TCS (Figure 5), indicate the occurrence of two major
groups, separated by two mutational steps. Table 3
aggregates the sazonal variation of haplotypes with samples numbers, between July, 2008 and February, 2009.
There is a difference between the haplotype frequencies
in each month: five exclusive haplotypes in November
2008 (H3, H8, H16, H17 and H18) are not found in the
collection for February, 2009, the month that had the
highest density of An. darling. The haplotypes with the
highest numbers of mosquitoes (H4, H5, H9, H11 and
H12) are present in all months of collection, except H6,
with only six samples. September, 2008, the month with
the lowest density and all An. darlingi collected were
analyzed, presented seven haplotypes. Six of these are
found in the previous month and remained in the

Discussion
The results presented here show variations in the density of mosquitoes between both sampling sites, showing
a relationship between local anophelines and degraded
natural areas. These changes result in several consequences for the mosquitoes fauna, establishing different
models of population dynamics of malaria vectors. Some
studies shows that modifications in natural environments promote succession of faunas and changes the
species adaptability in urban landscapes [59-61] and
these are important factors in the epidemiology of tropical diseases, being that settlement areas have growth in
the Amazon basin [62].
The species diversity and the total amount of anophelines show km 30 to have major abundance and population density, while km 24 reports low density. The choice
of these two sampling sites in Ramal do Granada was
justified by similar forms of human occupation, but with
different degrees of deforestation and human actions.
The landscape features of km 30 are newly deforested
areas with recent occupation, with a great presence of
burn forest residues in pastures, and significant coverage
of the Amazon rainforest. The distributions of houses in
this site are similar: all are close to the road, however distant from each other, as a consequence of a lower number of residences. Unlike at km 30, the km 24 location
has residences that are more aggregated and that have
been occupied for longer. Collections and reserves of
water are similar in both sites, with streams and artificial
ponds used for raising cattle. Thus, in comparing the five
3-hour captures, it appears that differences between both
sampling sites influence the development of the respective Anopheles population. The forest is directly related
to the biology of An. darlingi, and this difference is linked
with the ecology of the species in the environment of
each site [21,63]. Studies in rural settlements in Rondônia
reported, using the degree of urbanization, environment
and economic activity, highest malaria risk in areas are
around and next to forests [64].
The influence of human actions on populations of An.
darlingi in Ramal do Granada shows that a significant
level of degradation decreases the presence of this vector.
The area of the most recent occupation and closer to
undisturbed forest, the km 30, shows an increase in the
abundance of anopheline mosquitoes compared to km 24.
Epidemiological data of malaria in Ramal do Granada
indicate that km 30 is the locality with the most susceptible hosts and the highest incidence rate of disease, associating the observations that newcomers tend to settle in

forest fringes and tend to have no malaria immunity
[65,66]. Malaria prevalence in Granada is similar to that
described in peri-urban and rural populations in the State
of Rondônia; this area consists predominantly of migrants
who settled there at least a decade previously [67].
An. darlingi depends on the regions with forests for
their larval and adult survivorship, and profound
changes in their habitat may restrict their presence
[68,69]. Environmental analysis and characterization of
the breeding sites of both sampling sites has produced
more data for this argument [19]. However, differences
in the vectors’ densities along the same line of a rural
settlement can be affirmed analyzing these results; this
is an effective tool to indicate where case monitoring
and vector control should be directed [70].
The night biting activity seen in the 12-hour capture
reports the trend observed in other An. darlingi studies
in Amazon Basin; beginning at twilight, with peaks concentrated in the first part of the night [3,8]. May and
July, the biting activity starts at 6:00 pm, while the

others months starts after one hour (7:00 pm). The
main variations verified during each sampling month
were related to anopheline density; in the months with
higher densities, the presence of An. darlingi persisted
through the second part of the night until dawn, as
shown in February. The outdoor capture in May show
two peaks in the first part of the night, and indoor capture displays a bimodal pattern. The presence of more
than one peak during the twilight hours is reported in
outdoor capture in July, transition between the rainy
and dry season, and outdoor capture in November, transition between the dry to rainy season. July density concentrated in the first part of the night, and November
peaked later (11:00 pm), with activity until 5:00 pm.
This variations showed that though An. darlingi is most
active at twilight, a prolongation of biting activity is
common outside the standard time range, which
increases the vector capacity of the species. The 12-hour
capture also showed a high difference between indoor
and outdoor mosquitoes.

The seasonality data is linked with the presence and
types of breeding sites in the region, and is consequence
of the extent of landscape changes. Analyzing Figure 4,
indicates that the density of An. darlingi from May, 2008
to July, 2008 is in decline, showing a probable relationship with the decrease of rainfall and the beginning of
dry season [71]. One can speculate that the decrease in
precipitation left the breeding sites still able to support
breeding, but not enough to maintain high densities of
the vector. This prominent decrease in rain level was
reflected in minimal rates for mosquito populations in
September, 2008. With the transition to the rainy season,
there was a considerable density increase in November,
2008, followed by a large growth in February 2009, 61%
of the total An. darlingi collected during the all study.
Similar data in two villages located in Maroni River (Suriname and French Guiana frontier) shows after heavy
rainfall providing temporary breeding places for the A.
darlingi, which explains the rapid increase in population
densities after the rain [30]. It is also important to mention that the numbers of An. darlingi listed in Figure 4
are the three captures aggregate (3-hour capture km 24,
3-hour capture km 30 and 12-hour capture), so that a
greater proportion of these mosquitoes belong km 30.
Therefore, we can assume that the natural breeding site’s
capacity is maximized during the rainy season [14]. However, to support this hypothesis, there is the need to perform a larval study on the breeding sites in the area and
to correlate this with abundance of An. darlingi and river
levels [12].
The choice of samples for the molecular analysis was
based on two criteria: comparison between indoor and
outdoor mosquitoes, and variability and seasonal distribution of haplotypes. For this, a sample selection was
made, covering a significant portion of An. darlingi of all
times in 12-hours captures. In the final methodology,
were not processed A. darlingi from km 24 sampling site
and from May, 2008. No significant variability was
observed between the indoor and outdoor populations
(P = 0.265), despite the fact that Forattini [72] postulated
that exophilic and endophilic behavior could be a possible characteristic of distinct populations. Both collections, 3-hour and 12-hour capture, showed a prevalence
of outdoor mosquitoes. The Ramal do Granada, as in
other regions of the Amazon rainforest, has utilized control measures for malaria vectors, consisting of the use of
indoor insecticides [26]. House-spraying by SESACRE
(Acre State Secretariat of Health and Sanitation) is common; periodically, at three month intervals and immediately after a positive case is notified (called Bloqueio).
Spraying occurs in the homes of patients, ridding the
inside of their residence of the vectors. Quantitative data
show that there is a difference between the populations
of An. darlingi that feed in the home and those outside,

Page 10 of 12

as a consequence of the constant use of house spraying.
However, we can observe a significant increase in biting
activity in the intra-domicile region during the rainy
season.
The variability in seasonal distribution of haplotypes
shows monthly changes in population structure of
An. darlingi. Were defined as exclusive haplotypes the
strains found only one month of the study, and common
haplotype found in two months or more. The haplotypes
reported are representative samples from 12-hour capture;
July, September, November 2008 and February 2009.
Analyzing Figure 5 and Table 3, the two major groups,
separated by two mutational steps, have the same proportion of haplotypes exclusive and common. The first group,
H1 to H10 (58 samples) have four common haplotypes
(51 samples) and six exclusive haplotypes (7 samples). The
second group, H11 to H18 (52 samples), have three common haplotypes (44 samples) and five exclusive haplotypes
(8 samples). November, transition to the rainy season and
growing of An. darlingi population, have the greatest haplotype variability compared to other months of study.
ND4 polymorphism shows a intra-population variation
regulated by environmental (rainfall, temperature,
weather conditions) and anthropic factors (fogs, insecticides, forrest degradation). The Fst is significant only
between November and February and reveals two distinct
moments of the An. darlingi; the transition to the rains,
having a population growth and filling of vacant niches
in November and the population reaching the high density in February. This shows variation during population
dynamics in transition to the rains, however suggest no
shifting population structural; 84 samples from exclusive
haplotypes found in July are also reported in February,
which represents 76.36% of the total samples. The seasonal distribution of haplotypes shows no change in the
population of An. darlingi in Ramal do Granada.
This feature of the local anopheline population is relevant because frequent changes of the landscape can affect
population dynamics, allowing for the spread of groups of
genes related to malaria transmission, which enhance the
mosquitoes’ status as vectors [31]. It is also important to
mention that the Plasmodium vivax populations circulating in the Ramal do Granada are extraordinarily diverse,
factor that contributes to malaria transmission in endemic regions [73].

Conclusions
At the outset, An. darlingi is the major vector found in
this study area. Their distribution is related to forests
areas, and their abundance occurs in areas of recent colonization. An. darlingi behavior was similar to that
described in the scientific literature: activity at twilight
that persisted until halfway through the night and was
exophilic. Prolongation of the biting activity was reported

Moutinho et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:174
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/174

in months with higher densities. Variation of the population size is related to rainfall, and is a consequence of the
anthropogenic factors in the region. A high density of
species was reported during the rainy season. Sequencing
analysis of the mitochondrial gene ND4 shows that the
seasonal variability haplotype indicates a stable population, without the insertion of new strains in transition
between the dry and rainy seasons.
