Abstract
Background: The male-specific region of the mouse Y chromosome long arm (MSYq) contains
three known highly multi-copy X-Y homologous gene families, Ssty1/2, Sly and Asty. Deletions on
MSYq lead to teratozoospermia and subfertility or infertility, with a sex ratio skew in the offspring
of subfertile MSYqdel males
Results: We report the highly unusual genomic structure of a novel MSYq locus, Orly, and a diverse
set of spermatid-specific transcripts arising from copies of this locus. Orly is composed of partial
copies of Ssty1, Asty and Sly arranged in sequence. The Ssty1- and Sly-derived segments are in
antisense orientation relative to each other, leading to bi-directional transcription of Orly. Genome
search and phylogenetic tree analysis is used to determine the order of events in mouse Yq
evolution. We find that Orly is the most recent gene to arise on Yq, and that subsequently there
was massive expansion in copy number of all Yq-linked genes.
Conclusion: Orly has an unprecedented chimeric structure, and generates both "forward" (Orly)
and "reverse" (Orlyos) transcripts arising from the promoters at each end of the locus. The region
of overlap of known Orly and Orlyos transcripts is homologous to Sly intron 2. We propose that Orly
may be involved in an intragenomic conflict between mouse X and Y chromosomes, and that this
process underlies the massive expansion in copy number of the genes on MSYq and their X
homologues.

Background
The mammalian Y chromosome is constitutively haploid,
restricted to males, and subject to ongoing genetic deterioration due to lack of recombinational exchange with a
homologous partner. Set against this, however, there is
strong evolutionary drive to preserve the function of malebenefit genes on the Y chromosome, and to acquire novel
male-benefit genes on the Y [1-7]. These opposing effects
lead to a heterogeneous structure of Y chromosomal DNA,
with functional genes (often male specific, sometimes

highly amplified) set among a sea of degenerate pseudogenes, repetitive sequence, and parasitic transposable elements.
The long arm of the mouse Y chromosome is a spectacular
example of this process, being highly repetitive, transcriptionally silent in the majority of cell types, and yet indispensable for normal spermatogenesis [8-14]. Deletions
on mouse Yq lead to teratozoospermia and reduced fertility. The severity of the phenotypes varies according to the

extent of the deletion, with large deletions (> = 9/10 of
Yq) resulting in complete infertility [8,13], while smaller
deletions (~2/3 of Yq) result in reduced fertility and a less
severe sperm shape abnormality [9,11,14]. Intriguingly,
the offspring of males with 2/3 Yq deletions show an
approximately 60:40 sex ratio skew in favour of females
[9], and this is due to reduced efficiency of Y-bearing
sperm [15].
Recently, we have made considerable progress in defining
the gene content of mouse Yq, identifying two new repeat
gene families (Sly, Asty)[16] in addition to the one family
previously known (Ssty1/2). During this work, we
observed novel "recombinant" transcripts arising from
loci that contain exons from both Ssty1 and Asty, and
termed this new transcript Asty(rec) [16]. Here, we
describe the detailed genomic arrangement of this rearranged locus and show expression of a large variety of
transcriptional variants arising from these rearranged loci.
These variant transcripts are differentially regulated during testis development.
We were also interested to know how these rearranged
loci arose, and whether there were further examples of
such "exon shuffling" on mouse Yq. We therefore compared the genomic organisation of the loci encoding all
known Yq genes to each other and to their X-linked
homologues, in order to more clearly delineate the composition of the novel rearranged loci, the differences
between each of the Yq genes and their X-linked relatives,
and the sequence of events involved in the genesis and
amplification of these genes.
Finally, we investigated the wider genomic context of the
rearranged loci by in silico mapping of the location of all
known MSYq genes within the currently-released draft Y
chromosome sequence contigs. The MSYq gene copies
located by the mapping project were used to construct
phylogenetic trees elucidating the sequence of events in
MSYq evolution

Results
A rearranged locus formed by chimerism between three
Yq-specific genes
While we previously reported the presence of both Ssty1
and Asty exons within the locus encoding Asty(rec) [16],
further analysis of public genome sequence data shows
this locus to be entirely composed of regions with high
sequence similarity (greater than 90% across all regions)
to members of all three known Yq-linked gene families.
The structure of this novel locus is shown in Figure 1A. It
comprises sequence homologous to exons 1, 2 and partial
exon 3 of Ssty1, followed by exons 2–4 of Asty, followed
by exons 1–2 (and partial intron 2) of Sly in the opposite
orientation. Since the locus contains segments of all three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/171

Yq-linked gene families, we feel the designation Asty(rec)
is no longer appropriate. Given its highly unusual composition, and the fact that it is transcribed in both directions,
we propose the name Orly (Oppositely-transcribed, rearranged locus on the Y).
As previously detailed [16], a search of the nr database
revealed two full-length cDNAs arising from Orly, both
originating from the relict Ssty1 promoter. In this article
we will refer to these transcripts as Orly_v1 (accession
number [GenBank:AK015935]) and Orly_v2 ([Genbank:AK016790], referred to in our previous work as
Asty(rec)). The splicing patterns of Orly_v1 and Orly_v2
are shown in Figure 1B.
Orly generates a wide diversity of alternative splice
variants
The existence of the Orly_v1 and Orly_v2 transcripts indicates differential splicing of the central exons in Orly. We
performed a screen using primers from the various exons
present in Orly_v2 (locations indicated in Figure 1C,
sequences in Table 1) in order to see what further Orly
splice variants were expressed. All primer pairs that gave
an RT-PCR product from adult testis were tested using a
range of normal mouse testis RNAs from different ages
post partum in order to resolve the developmental onset of
expression for each splice variant form (Figure 2). Primer
pairs S1.f2/N2.r2 and N1.f/N2.r2 were also tested against
a range of tissues to check tissue specificity of expression,
and proved to be testis specific (Figure 3).

When using primer pairs directed at the outermost exons
(S1 and N2), a single major band corresponding to
Orly_v1 is observed, suggesting that this is the most abundant Orly transcript. Two faint larger bands were also
detected by the S1.f2/N2.r2 primer pair (arrowed in Figure 3), however, we were unable to obtain sequence for
these products. These upper bands are likely to represent
transcripts including portions of Ssty1 exons 2/3 or Asty
exons 2–4, as detected in the other reactions (see below).
No larger bands were seen in the S1.f1/N2.r1 reaction. It
is possible that the larger bands detected by the S1.f2/
N2.r2 primer pair arises from copies of the Orly locus
where the exon S1.f1 and/or N2.r1 primer binding sites
are mutated.
Using primer pairs directed at the other Orly_v2 exons
gave a wide variety of bands. Many of the products generated from RT-PCR on adult testis were gel purified and
sequenced to confirm which regions of Orly are included
in each detected transcript. Unfortunately we were unable
to generate clean sequence for the products produced by
the S3a.f/A3.r primer pair. This is likely due to the presence of a large number of similarly-sized transcripts which
cannot be separated on a gel. The resulting partial tran-

scriptional map for Orly is shown in Figure 1D. In most
cases, the sequenced bands correspond to spliced transcripts, however, the majority of the products do not conform to the splicing pattern of Orly_v1 or Orly_v2. It
appears that there is a plethora of different Orly isoforms
expressed at low levels, which are only detected when specific primers are used.
We investigated whether any of the detected Orly isoforms
had any significant coding potential. The Ssty1 open reading frame is encoded by exon 3 of Ssty1, which is not fully
included in any Orly transcriptional variant (though two

shorter forms of this exon are variably included). Orly
transcripts thus do not encode the SSTY1 protein. The Sly
portion of the locus is in antisense, thus Orly transcripts
cannot encode any portion of SLY. Finally, Asty does not
contain any open reading frame, thus the Asty-related portion of Orly also has no coding potential. Further electronic searching of the various Orly transcriptional
variants revealed no significant open reading frames other
than a partial degenerate retroviral pol sequence (see
below).

band in each case.

Orly retains potential promoter sequence from both Ssty1
and Sly
The regions of high sequence identity between Orly and its
various progenitor loci extend a further 5 kb into the
upstream region of Ssty, and 3 kb into the upstream region
of Sly, indicating that the rearranged locus has retained the
proximal upstream promoter regions of both genes, in
antisense orientation relative to each other (Additional
File 1). Orly_v1 and Orly_v2 are known to be transcribed
from the relict Ssty1 promoter [16], which is thus shown
to be functional.

Turning to the relict Sly promoter region, we conducted a
search for transcription factor binding sites using
TFSEARCH [17]. This showed that of the 42 predicted
transcription factor binding located between -600 and
+10 of the reference Sly sequence, 35 were present at the
corresponding site in Orly, indicating retention of potentially functional promoter elements (Additional File 2).
Overall sequence identity between Sly and Orly across this

region is 95.7%. Significantly, the conserved elements
include a GCCAAT box at position -161 of the reference
Sly locus. This motif is a strong transcriptional signal, and
is known to be present in other spermatid specific TATAless promoters such as the Pgk-2 promoter [18].
Both of the promoters at opposite ends of Orly are
functional
This electronic promoter analysis suggested to us that the
relict Sly promoter at the 3' end of the Orly locus may have
retained functionality, and be able to generate oppositestrand transcripts. We designate such opposite-strand
transcripts as Orlyos. No Orlyos transcripts were present in
the nr or dbEST databases. We used strand-specific RTPCR to determine whether any of the bands shown in Figure 2 corresponded to Orlyos transcripts.

Importantly, of the three bands obtained using the N1.f/
N2.r2 primer pair, the lower band corresponds to a forward orientation (Orly) transcript, while the upper band

(Orly) transcripts (data not shown). This is unsurprising
as the primers were designed against the forward transcript Orly_v2. Orlyos transcripts must necessarily have different exon boundaries, which presumably do not include
the majority of the primer locations included in our
screen.
The terminal exons of Orly derive from a retrovirus and
are in antisense to Sly and Orlyos
Both of the known Orly transcripts terminate with two
novel exons with antisense homology to intron 2 of Sly
(see Figure 1A, exons N1 and N2). As discussed above,
this section of Orly is also transcribed in the opposite orientation, generating Orlyos transcripts. Thus there is the
potential for Orly transcripts to form dsRNA either by pairing with Orlyos transcripts or with nascent Sly transcripts.

Sequencing confirmed that this RT-PCR product shows
99% identity to the reference Orly genomic sequence over
622 nt, and only 91% identity to Sly over 464 nt. This
demonstrates that this transcript arises from an Orly locus
rather than from Sly, and constitutes a true Orlyos transcript. The middle band seen in this reaction is not always
detected by RT-PCR, and we were unable to determine the
direction of transcription of this band.
Of the other splice variants shown in Figure 2, all were
confirmed by strand-specific RT-PCR to be "forward"

Exons N1 and N2 derive from a partial degenerate retrovirus belonging to the MuRVY lineage of mouse Y chromosome specific repeats [19], which is embedded in this
intron of Sly (see below). Orly-F transcripts terminate at
the transcription stop site of this MuRVY-related element.
We therefore deduce that although the MuRVY element is
degenerate and does not encode a functional retrovirus,
its transcriptional termination site has remained functional and become co-opted to form the transcriptional
termination site for Orly forward transcripts. None of the
known Orly transcripts contain any large open reading
frames, however, Orly_v1 contains a short ORF running
from bases 117–284. This ORF has 63% identity and 75%
similarity over 49aa to a partial pol gene (data not shown),
further demonstrating the retroviral origin of the terminal
exons of Orly.
Tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of
Orly isoforms
Orly transcripts are under tight transcriptional control. All
variant forms (both forward and reverse) are only
observed after day 19 of postnatal life, and thus are
deduced to be spermatid-specific. This is to be expected as
both Ssty1 and Sly promoters are spermatid specific
[9,13,16]. The age of first appearance for each band varied
from day 19 to 23, indicating differential regulation of
Orly isoforms in successive spermatid stages. This variation was observed both between different primer pairs
(e.g. the majority of S1.f1/A4.r bands appear at 23 dpp,
while the majority of S1.f1/A3.r bands appear at 21 dpp),
and between different bands detected by the same primer
pair (e.g. the upper, lower and middle bands in the N1.f/
N2.r2 reaction appear at 19, 21 and 23 days respectively).
This differential regulation may be due to spermatid stage
dependent splicing of transcripts, or may represent varying subsets of transcripts arising from different copies of
Orly with subtly different promoter activities. It is unfortunately not possible to use in situ or Northern blot data

locus as a whole. The coding region is conserved (barring
the final 5 amino acids of Ssty1), and lies entirely within
exon 3. Sequence identity within the coding region is
86.4%. The splice site at the end of the first exon is conserved. Ssty2 does not incorporate sequence corresponding to exon 2 of Ssty1. The splice site at the start of the
terminal exon is located differently in Ssty1 and Ssty2, the
latter thus having a longer terminal exon which in part
matches intronic sequence from Ssty1. The 5'UTRs of the
two gene transcripts are thus very different despite the
high sequence identity between the loci. An X-linked
member of this gene family (Sstx) is known, however, the
similarity at the nucleotide level is low except for a small
segment at the start of the coding region (76% over 135
bp) [Paul Burgoyne, personal communication].

to confirm the detailed cellular expression patterns of
these transcripts, since there is no portion of any of them
which is not also part of a different Y-linked gene or retrovirus with a confounding expression pattern.
Genomic comparisons of Orly, its progenitor loci, and
their X homologues
We carried out a detailed comparison of the genomic loci
encoding Orly, the other MSYq genes and their X counterparts, in order to better delineate the sequence of events
during MSYq evolution.
Genomic comparison of Ssty1 and Ssty2
The structure of the reference genomic loci encoding
Ssty1/2 is shown in Figure 5 (see Additional File 3 for ClustalW alignment). Sequence identity is 82.7% across the

Genomic comparison of Xmr and Xlr
The structure of the reference genomic loci for Xmr and Xlr
is shown in Figure 6. Xmr has two transcriptional variants
arising from alternative transcription start sites, as indicated in this figure. The structure of Xlr is similar to the
shorter transcriptional variant of Xmr, however, there is
considerable sequence divergence in exon 4 of Xlr. In particular, the 3' portion of Xlr exon 5 does not match any
Xmr sequence. The longer transcript derived from the Xmr
locus contains 4 additional 5' exons which do not show
sequence similarity to the upstream region of the Xlr
locus. These exons thus represent either novel sequence
acquired by Xmr following Xmr/Xlr divergence, or deletion
of the 5' portion of the Xlr locus.

There are two partial degenerate LINE elements within the
Xmr locus, the first lying in the second intron of the longer
isoform, and the second lying in the sixth intron (and thus
also present in the fourth intron of Xlr). In addition to
these degenerate LINEs, Xmr also contains a full-length
LINE element from the L1MD-A2 lineage, which includes
upstream monomer repeats and thus is potentially transcriptionally active [20]. The element lies in intron 7 of
Xmr but is not found in the corresponding location
(intron 6) of Xlr, indicating that the LINE insertion
occurred subsequent to Xmr/Xlr divergence.

indicates the position and orientation of LINE elements. Xmr contains a LINE
insertion in intron 7 that is not present in Xlr and presumably postdates Xmr/Xlr divergence. There are two transcriptional variants of Xmr, neither of which splice in an exon corresponding to Xlr exon 5. This exon encodes the nuclear localisation signal,
thus Xmr has lost the ancestral nuclear pattern of expression. The longer Xmr isoforms has 4 unique 5' exons.

Sly arose as a chimeric gene via fusion of Xmr and Xlr
Sly, the Yq-linked member of the family, is a chimeric
gene formed by fusion of the 5' portion of Xmr to the 3'
portion of Xlr. Figure 7 shows the structure of Sly together
with the homologous regions of Xmr and Xlr.

The origin of the 5' end of Sly is demonstrated by exons
1–4, which match the 4 additional exons uniquely present

in the longer Xmr isoform. The origin of the 3' end of Sly
is demonstrated by exons 7–10, which match the final
exons of Xlr including the Xlr-specific portion of exon 5.
Sly lacks the L1MD-A2 element present in Xmr intron 7,
further confirming the chimeric nature of this gene as an
Xmr/Xlr hybrid. Exons 5–6 of Sly arose via duplication of
exons 3–4 and show 88/102 nucleotide identity to these
exons. There are degenerate LINE elements at the borders

of this duplication event, and also at the border between
the Xmr-derived and Xlr-derived segments of Sly, thus it is
likely that recombination between LINE elements was
responsible for the creation of Sly.
The LINE element present in intron 2 of Sly is interrupted
by a stretch of DNA with distant sequence similarity to the
mouse MSYq-specific retrovirus, MuRVY. This LINE element is uninterrupted in the progenitor Xmr, thus we conclude that the MuRVY insertion occurred subsequent to
the creation of Sly. The MuRVY-related sequence is
inserted in antisense orientation relative to Sly itself. The
extent of the MuRVY-related stretch of DNA varies
between Sly copies (see phylogenetic tree analysis below),
but in all cases the terminal portion (including MuRVY
transcription termination site) is retained. RepeatMasker
analysis [21] of the insert shows 13.1% divergence, 13.1%
deletion and 3.2% insertion relative to the consensus
MuRVY LTR sequence, and 32.5% divergence for non-LTR
portions of the insert. As discussed above, the MuRVYrelated sequence in Sly intron 2 forms the source for the
terminal Orly exons.
Recent work has shown that both Xmr encodes a cytoplasmic protein, in contrast to the protein encoded by Xlr,
which is nuclear[22]. The KRKR nuclear localisation signal in Xlr, which is conserved from the autosomal progenitor gene SCP3, is located in exon 5. Xmr does not include
this exon, suggesting that this is the reason for the altered
protein localisation. Interestingly, this signal is mutated to
KRKW in the corresponding portion of Sly.
Genomic comparison of Asty/Astx
As reported previously [16], Asty and Astx have an identical genomic organisation, and share ~95% sequence identity across introns and exons.
The genomic context of Orly
We used BLAST comparison to search for all copies of each
Yq-linked gene (Ssty1/2, Asty, Sly, Orly) in the currentlyreleased draft sequence contigs [Mouse Chromosome Y
Mapping Project (Jessica E. Alfoldi, Helen Skaletsky, Steve
Rozen, and David C. Page at the Whitehead Institute for
Biomedical Research, Cambridge MA, and the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center, St. Louis
MO)].

We then used this information to generate a "fingerprint"
for each available Yq contig, noting the order and orientation of the various copies of each gene present in each
contig (see Additional File 4). Interestingly, we found that
Orly always has the same genomic context, being flanked
downstream by Ssty1 and upstream by Ssty2, with both
loci in the same orientation as Orly. The neighbouring
copies of Ssty1 all contain a SINE insertion at position

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/171

393, and form a distinct sub-group within the phylogenetic tree (see below: bootstrap support value for this
clade is 1000/1000 replicates).
Using the fingerprints as a guide, we were able to assemble
a "super-contig" containing 3 copies of Ssty1, 3 copies of
Ssty2, two copies of Asty, two copies of Sly and one copy of
Orly. In all, 13 of the 33 Yq contigs are congruent with this
super-contig ordering, and a further 4 contigs appear to be
slight variants upon it. This "super-contig" indicates the
presence on mouse Yq of a highly amplified repeat unit of
greater than 500 kb in length, which presumably corresponds to the Huge Repeat Array reported at conferences
by Alfoldi et al [23]. Sequence identity between the various contigs contributing to this "super-contig" is very high
(> 98% excluding indels), indicating substantial homogeneity between copies of the Huge Repeat.
Figure 8 shows the layout of the Huge Repeat unit, and the
contigs that match this ordering. Figure 9 is an example
Dotter alignment of two Huge Repeat contigs, [GenBank:NT_161892] and [GenBank:NT_161926], demonstrating that high sequence homology extends across the
entire contig, genic and intergenic regions included. In all,
these two contigs share 98.26% nucleotide identity over
235813 nt. The Huge Repeat is itself internally repetitive –
it can be seen in Figure 8 that there is a repeating segment
containing Ssty1, Asty and Sly in order. Figure 10 is a Dotter plot comparing [GenBank:NT_165794] to itself, demonstrating this internal repeat. The repeat region in this
contig shows 98.12% identity over 179584 nt.
However, many contigs did not fit the Huge Repeat consensus ordering. Two further classes of Yq contig were
identified (see Table 2): Ssty/Asty-enriched contigs (n = 7)
and Sly /Asty-enriched contigs (n = 5), while 4 contigs
remained unclassifiable. These non Huge Repeat contigs
were also highly internally repetitive. Figure 11 is an
example Dotter plot comparing [GenBank:NT_161904]
to itself. The structure is of a tandem repeat unit of ~120
kb embedded inside a larger tandem repeat of ~210 kb. In
all, the repeated segment in NT_161904 shows 97.78%
identity over 204851 nt.
Dynamics of Yq gene family expansion
A key question is whether these four gene families (Ssty1/
2, Asty, Sly and Orly) were amplified separately on Yq during mouse evolution, or whether there was a single period
of amplification increasing the copy number of all genes
simultaneously.

We constructed a set of phylogenetic trees using the neighbour-joining method of Saitou & Nei [24], comparing
Ssty1-, Asty- and Sly-derived regions of Orly to the corresponding regions of the progenitor loci (Figures 12, 13,

Schematic diagram showing the layout of the Huge Repeat Array repeat unit on mouse Yq. Order and orientation of Yq gene
copies is shown, with individual contigs represented as line segments below. The size range of the interval between each gene
locus is shown. The repeat unit is at least 500 kb in length, but our current analysis is unable to define the complete extent of
the repeat. The Ssty1 copies within the repeat can be distinguished from each other based on the presence or absence of a
SINE insertion, and by a deletion removing exons 1–2 of one copy of Ssty1 (see also Figure 10).

14). For the Asty- and Sly-related trees, we were able to use
the X-linked homologue as an outgroup to root the tree,
however, for the Ssty-related tree this is not possible owing
to much greater divergence of the X homologue which
precludes accurate alignment. For this tree, the Ssty2 clade
was used as the outgroup to root the tree. Bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates was used to establish the robustness of all three trees.
From this phylogenetic analysis we observe:
• In all three cases, Orly sequences form a discrete clade
(bootstrap support value of 1000/1000 replicates for all
three trees).
• Gene copies lying within the Huge Repeat contigs also
form distinct clades in all three trees (bootstrap support of
960/100 to 1000/1000 in all cases). Note that each copy
of the Huge Repeat unit contains several copies of Ssty1,

Ssty2 and Asty. These three genes thus give rise to several
Huge Repeat-associated clades in each tree. Each of these
clades contains the gene copies from matching locations
within the Huge Repeat unit.
• A final set of contigs forms a distinct clade in both the
Ssty and Asty-related trees. This clade contains a group of
Ssty1 /Asty-enriched contigs, [GenBank:NT_161904],
GenBank:NT_161906, GenBank:NT_161911] (bootstrap
values 969/1000 to 1000/1000 in the two trees). At
slightly lower confidence levels, this clade also includes
[GenBank:NT_165795] (bootstrap values 902/1000 to
989/1000 in the two trees).
• At the time of Orly divergence, the Ssty family was
already moderately amplified on the Y, with ~8 Ssty1 lineages and ~13 Ssty2 lineages present. By contrast, at the
time of Orly divergence, there were only ~4 Asty lineages
and 1 Sly lineage present on the Y

identity between copies of the Huge Repeat. Locations of gene loci within the contigs are indicated. The homology between
Orly and its component loci is clearly visible as three short internal repeat sections within the contigs (ringed).

• In all three cases, there was a massive amplification of
gene copy number subsequent to Orly divergence. This
amplification occurred predominantly in branches of the

phylogenetic tree corresponding to Huge Repeat contigs,
however, there was also amplification of a Ssty1 /Astyenriched clade subsequent to divergence of the Orly clade.

Dot plot comparing [GenBank:NT_165794] to itself, in order to demonstrate the nested repeat structure of the Huge Repeat
Array. Although the repeat unit of the Huge Repeat Array spans at least 500 k (see Figure 8), it also contains an internal
repeat with a unit length of ~220k, containing copies of Ssty1, Asty and Sly. Visible (ringed) is a small deletion in one of the
repeat units, which has deleted the first two exons of the Ssty1 copy located in the region.

From these trees, we also observed that all genes within
each family showed very similar degrees of divergence
from the root of the tree in all cases. This is to be expected
as all three trees were based on noncoding sequence. The

sequence used to build the trees is thus likely to be evolving at nearly neutral rates. Given nearly neutral rates of
evolution, the degree of sequence divergence forms a
"molecular clock" indicating the timing of the various

the Orly branches of the tree (representing the date of
amplification of the Huge Repeat Array) is 0.47% for the
Ssty1-derived region, 0.41% for the Asty-derived region
and 0.43% for the Sly-derived region. While the absolute
rate of the clock cannot be determined from these data,
the numbers obtained from the three trees are in good
agreement with each other, strengthening our inferences
of the timing of events on Yq.
Conclusions of the phylogenetic study
Taken together, these results of the phylogenetic tree analysis and locus fingerprinting of Yq contigs indicate that
events on Yq occurred in the following sequence.

1) Sstx/Ssty divergence (too long ago to be addressed by
nucleotide sequence analysis)
2)Ssty1/Ssty2 divergence
3) Generation of Sly by chimerism between Xmr and Xlr
4) Moderate amplification of Ssty1, Ssty2 and Asty
5) Generation of Orly by chimerism between Ssty1, Asty
and Sly
6) Massive amplification of two familes of large-scale
repeat on Yq. The first repeat family contains representatives of all Yq genes including Orly and constitutes the
Huge Repeat Array, while the second specifically contains
Ssty1 and Asty.
At present unresolved is the question of when the MuRVY
retrovirus arrived on Yq. The presence of MuRVY-related
sequence within intron 2 of every copy of Sly indicates
that Sly acquired its MuRVY-derived insert in intron 2
some time between stages (3) and (6), however, the origin
of MuRVY itself cannot be placed in the above sequence
from available evidence.

Discussion
We report here on the genomic locus Orly and the wide
variety of alternatively spliced transcripts arising from it.
Orly has a complex and unusual genomic structure, being
derived from partial copies of three other Yq-linked genes.
Intriguingly, we also found Sly to be derived by combination of existing genes, in this case a fusion of the 5' region
of Xmr with the 3' region of Xlr, together with an internal
duplication of exons 3–4 of the Xmr-derived segment.
This may indicate that chimerism and "exon shuffling" are
a general feature of novel Y chromosome gene creation.
Significantly, the two outermost partial gene loci contributing to Orly are in antisense orientation relative to each
other, and retain their upstream promoter regions. We
detected Orlyos transcripts in addition to Orly transcripts,
and thus deduce that both promoters have retained their
activity. In particular, exons N1, N2 and the intervening
intron are transcribed in both directions. This region
derives from a MuRVY retroviral insertion into intron 2 of
Sly.
There is an intriguing parallel to be drawn with the Stellate
system in Drosophila melanogaster, where there is a sense/
antisense regulatory loop between X-encoded Stellate and
Y-encoded Su(Ste) repeat genes [25]. In the case of Stellate,
the Y gene arose from the X gene by insertion of a transposon (with active promoter) in reverse orientation [26,27].
Antisense Su(Ste) transcripts primed from the transposon
promoter act to regulate both sense Su(Ste) and Stellate
transcript levels via an RNAi mechanism [25,28]. Similarly, Orly and Orlyos transcripts could potentially regulate
each other and also Sly. A key avenue of future work is to
determine the full length sequence of Orlyos, in particular
whether it contains any Ssty1- or Asty-derived regions
which may in turn regulate these genes.
The comparison to Stellate is especially interesting given
the sex ratio skewing in male mice bearing partial Yq deletions. Partial deletions of the repressor Su(Ste) on Drosophila Y chromosome lead to sex ratio skewing or
infertility dependent upon the X chromosomal Stellate
haplotype present [29]. Stellate was hypothesised to be a

meiotic drive gene [30,31], although this is now disputed
[32]. In male mice, partial deletions of Yq lead to mild teratozoospermia and sex ratio skewing [9,11,14], with
reduced effectiveness of Y-bearing sperm [15]. Larger deletions lead to severe teratozoospermia and infertility
[8,13]. The mice with partial deletions show normal fertility and fecundity (in terms of number of successful matings and number of offspring per litter), thus the only
effect of the decrease in Yq gene copy number appears to
be the sex ratio skew.
It should be understood that the sex ratio skew in mouse
with Yq deletions does not constitute meiotic drive in the
classical sense, since equal numbers of X- and Y-bearing
gametes are generated at meiosis [15]. Nevertheless, the
presence of Yq-encoded genes affecting sex ratio indicates
the potential for a conflict between these Yq-encoded
genes and other interacting X- or autosomally-encoded
factors. Given that Yq deletion also leads to a spermatid-

specific derepression of X transcripts [33], with increasing
X gene expression correlated with the extent of the deletion, we have suggested that there may indeed be an ongoing genomic conflict between the mouse X and Y
chromosomes, with X-linked sex ratio distorter genes acting to favour generation of female offspring, and Yqlinked repressor genes acting to restore a normal 50:50 sex
ratio. Such an intragenomic conflict is expected to lead to
massive amplification of gene number on both chromosomes due to an "arms race" between the conflicting genes
[34]. Intriguingly, the hybrid sterility seen in Mus musculus
musculus/Mus musculus molossinus consomic strains is Xdependent [35].
Whether genomic conflict is involved or not, the fact that
Yq-encoded genes are necessary for normal levels of Y
chromosome transmission necessarily leads to a strong
and direct evolutionary pressure to maintain the function
of these genes. This may be one of the factors behind the

recent and highly unusual gene amplification seen on
mouse Yq. Orly, being composed of portions of all the
other known MSYq-linked genes, must also necessarily be
the most recent known addition to MSYq gene content.

Conclusion
Orly is a novel chimeric locus on mouse chromosome Yq
which is bidirectionally transcribed, giving rise to Orly
and Orlyos transcripts. These transcripts may potentially
form dsRNA in partnership with each other, or with the
progenitor loci Ssty1,Asty and Sly. A phylogenetic tree
analysis of Yq genes indicates that Orly arose shortly prior
to a massive expansion in copy number of all the Yqlinked genes. Also, potentially significantly, copies of Orly
are only found in the context of the Huge Repeat Array
that distinguishes MSYq – a particular segment of around
500 kb that appears to have been amplified en bloc. Taking
the above evidence together, we propose that the emergence of Orly may have been one of the triggers that led to
massive amplification of Yq sequence. Further analysis of
the genomic complement of MSYq, and the copy number
of the corresponding X genes, in a range of different
mouse subspecies should help date these events more precisely, and establish whether X-Y genomic competition is
a contributing factor to the gene amplifications.

Methods
Sequence comparison and detection of copies of Yq-linked
genes
Nucleotide sequence alignment was performed using
BLAST and ClustalW. Copies of Yq-linked genes were
located within the currently-released draft sequence contigs [Mouse Chromosome Y Mapping Project (Jessica E.
Alfoldi, Helen Skaletsky, Steve Rozen, and David C. Page
at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge MA, and the Washington University Genome
Sequencing Center, St. Louis MO)] by pairwise alignment
of reference gene sequences to each contig. All full-length
hits were recorded, thus this study does not distinguish
between genes and pseudogenes in each family. For Ssty1,
Ssty2, Asty and Orly, a window size of 40 nt was used,
while for Sly a window size of 100 nt was used. Additional
File 4 is a complete record of all loci detected in the course
of this study. The reference sequences used for this search
were as follows.

Orly:

ref|NT_161926.2|MmY_159634_36:179263-

The reference sequences for Ssty1, Ssty2 and Sly are drawn
from the Gene database of the NCBI [36]. The reference
sequence for Asty was selected as the hit with the highest
percentage identity to the known partial cDNA sequence
[GenBank:DQ874391]. In the case of Orly, we define the
locus as extending from the transcriptional start site (TSS)
of the relict Ssty1 partial sequence to the TSS of the relict
Sly partial sequence. The locus chosen as a reference is that
encoding the known transcript Orly_v1 ([GenBank:AK015935]). Note that both the reference genome
sequence and the reference gene sequences are from the
C57/Bl6 strain. Dot plots of selected contigs and gene loci
were generated using JDotter [37], with grey scale values
set to highlight the appropriate homologies.
Phylogenetic tree analysis
All full-length copies of Ssty1/2, Sly, Asty and Orly identified by the contig search were used to build these trees.
The reference sequences for Xmr and Astx were included in
the appropriate trees in order to determine the timing of
MSYq events relative to the split between X and Y homologues, however, the high degree of nucleotide sequence
divergence between Sstx and Ssty precluded the inclusion
of the X-linked gene for this tree.

For each gene family, a region excluding known proteincoding sequence was selected for alignment, thus nearly
neutral rates of evolution can be assumed. Since Asty
appears to be non-coding, the full length of all detected
Asty sequences (~2.1 k) was used for the Astx/Asty/Orly
tree, together with the homologous regions of Astx and
Orly. For the Ssty1/Ssty2/Orly and for Xmr/Sly/Orly trees,
the aligned region comprises the 3' UTR and all introns
within the 3' UTR. This is ~1.5 kb for the Ssty1/Ssty2/Orly
tree and 1.4 k for the Xmr/Sly/Orly tree.
Interestingly, the opening ATG codon was conserved in all
detected copies of both families, including conservation
of this codon at both ends of all copies of Orly. The significance of this observation is unclear. Alignment of the
gene copies was performed using ClustalW via the EBI
website [38], and ClustalX used to generate each tree using
the Saitou/Nei NJ algorithm. 1000 bootstrap replicates
were used to assess the robustness of each tree. Additional
File 8 contains the three NJ trees and the ClustalW files
used to generate each tree. JalView [39] was used to generate the figures included in this manuscript.
RT-PCR

the RNAse free DNAse set (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed using the One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Briefly,
