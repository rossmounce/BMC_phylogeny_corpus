Abstract
Background: Oomycetes of the genus Phytophthora are pathogens that infect a wide range of plant species. For dicot
hosts such as tomato, potato and soybean, Phytophthora is even the most important pathogen. Previous analyses of
Phytophthora genomes uncovered many genes, large gene families and large genome sizes that can partially be
explained by significant repeat expansion patterns.
Results: Analysis of the complete genomes of three different Phytophthora species, using a newly developed
approach, unveiled a large number of small duplicated blocks, mainly consisting of two or three consecutive genes.
Further analysis of these duplicated genes and comparison with the known gene and genome duplication history of
ten other eukaryotes including parasites, algae, plants, fungi, vertebrates and invertebrates, suggests that the ancestor
of P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum most likely underwent a whole genome duplication (WGD). Genes that have
survived in duplicate are mainly genes that are known to be preferentially retained following WGDs, but also genes
important for pathogenicity and infection of the different hosts seem to have been retained in excess. As a result, the
WGD might have contributed to the evolutionary and pathogenic success of Phytophthora.
Conclusions: The fact that we find many small blocks of duplicated genes indicates that the genomes of Phytophthora
species have been heavily rearranged following the WGD. Most likely, the high repeat content in these genomes have
played an important role in this rearrangement process. As a consequence, the paucity of retained larger duplicated
blocks has greatly complicated previous attempts to detect remnants of a large-scale duplication event in
Phytophthora. However, as we show here, our newly developed strategy to identify very small duplicated blocks might
be a useful approach to uncover ancient polyploidy events, in particular for heavily rearranged genomes.
Background
Oomycetes or water molds form a diverse group of
eukaryotic micro-organisms that have originally been
classified as Fungi because of their similarity in growth
morphology, propagation through spores and weaponry
to infect host organisms [1]. Furthermore, they occupy
similar ecological niches and share many cell wall degrading enzymes to weaken host tissues [2,3]. However, biochemical and molecular data have shown that oomycetes
have little affinity with "true" fungi but are instead more
closely related to heterokont algae and diatoms [4,5],
belonging to the assemblage chromalveolates, which also
include organisms such as ciliates, apicomplexans and

dinoflagellates [6,7]. Also in contrast to fungi, oomycetes
are diploid organisms that lack a free haploid life stage.
Members of the genus Phytophthora cause devastating
diseases on a wide range of plants, and are the most
important pathogens of dicots. For instance, Phytophthora infestans, responsible for severe damage in the
food production worldwide by infecting tomato and
potato [8], was the infective agent of the so-called potato
blight that caused the Irish famine between 1845 and
1849, during which approximately one million people
died and another million emigrated [9,10]. Another species, P. sojae, causes root and stem rot in soybean resulting in huge annual production losses [11].
So far, three Phytophthora species have been fully
sequenced and annotated, namely P. sojae, P. ramorum
and P. infestans. Breakouts of the 'sudden oak death' disease caused by P. ramorum led to the first Phytophthora
genome project. Since there were no close relatives

sequenced yet, a second genome, the one of Phytophthora
sojae, was sequenced simultaneously. P. sojae and P.
ramorum have a genome size of 95 Mb and 65 Mb,
respectively [12]. P. infestans, of which the genome
sequence has been determined recently as well, has an
estimated genome size of 240 Mb [13]. In comparison to
other plant pathogens, the Phytophthora genomes are
quite large. Bacterial genomes are often smaller than 10
Mb and fungal genomes rarely exceed 40 Mb [14]. The
larger size of the P. sojae genome compared to P. ramorum is not only because of the higher number of predicted genes (16.988 and 14.451, respectively [13]) but
also because of larger intergenic regions and different retrotransposon expansion patterns [12,15]. In P. infestans,
which has 17.797 predicted genes [13], the intergenic
regions are even larger than in P. sojae and the number of
different types of transposons is overwhelming [13,1618]. The P. infestans genome is by far the largest chromalveolate genome sequenced and Haas and colleagues
(2009) have shown that its expansion results from a proliferation of repetitive DNA accounting for ~74% of the
genome [13]. Comparison of the three Phytophthora
genomes also revealed an unusual genome organization;
i.e. regions with conserved gene order, high gene density
and lower repeat content are separated by regions with
non-conserved gene order, low gene density and high
repeat content [13].
In a previous study, we observed that Phytophthora
species have many more genes than most other chromalveolate species for which the complete genome sequence
has been determined [19]. Also the average gene family
size is larger than for the other chromalveolates, except
for the ciliates Paramecium tetraurelia, which has undergone three whole genome duplication events [20] and
Tetrahymena thermophila, which has undergone an
extensive number of tandem duplications [21]. Furthermore, in particular genes important for the interaction
with their hosts, such as genes encoding cell wall degrading enzymes, often seem to have been duplicated in Phytophthora species [19,22]. Here, we have tried to unravel
the duplication past of the three Phytophthora species
and conclude that many of the duplicated genes are likely
the result of a shared ancient large-scale or even whole
genome duplication event.

Results
Duplicated regions in the Phytophthora genome

If an organism has undergone a large-scale or whole
genome duplication (WGD) in its evolutionary past,
there is a reasonable chance to find remnants of this
event. For instance, such remnants can be detected by the
identification of genomic segments sharing a set of
homologous genes [23]. When also the order of the

Page 2 of 16

homologous genes (sometimes referred to as anchor
points or anchors) on the chromosomes is still conserved,
the evidence for a block duplication is strengthened. To
define homologous gene pairs within each of the Phytophthora species and reference organisms, the proteomes were grouped into gene families based on
sequence similarity and Markov clustering (see Methods). Gene families with more than 100 members were
omitted from the analysis since these gene families are
often artefacts of the gene family clustering methods, i.e.
artificial clustering of different families into superfamilies. Also gene pairs with a KS-value lower than 0.1 and/or
lying on a small scaffold (i.e. fewer than 6 genes) were
omitted from the analysis (see Methods).
Using our previously developed software i-ADHoRe
[24], we identified blocks of homologous genes in the
Phytophthora genomes. In brief, the i-ADHoRe algorithm
detects homologous (duplicated) regions in a genome by
identifying diagonals in a gene homology matrix, after
which the longest diagonal or duplicated region is
reported. The whole procedure is controlled by a set of
parameters including gap size, which describes the maximal number of intervening, non-homologous genes tolerated between two homologous genes within a collinear
segment, and a parameter determining to what extent the
elements of a cluster fit on a diagonal line. Because of its
specific development and implementation, the algorithm
can only detect clusters of at least three homologous gene
pairs [23,25].
To our surprise, the large majority of duplicated blocks
in P. infestans consist of only three homologous gene
pairs (only one block of five duplicated genes and seven
blocks of four genes could be detected; data not shown).
The same is observed for both other Phytophthora species, namely P. sojae and P. ramorum (data not shown).
For all duplicated blocks, we also counted the number of
intervening (non-homologous) genes. Strikingly, the
average number of intervening genes is extremely small
and in most cases the duplicated genes in these small
blocks are located directly next to each other.
The fact that Phytophthora species, especially P. infestans and P. sojae, have a large number of genes and many
multicopy gene families [19], as well as many duplicated
blocks of three homologs, raised the question whether
these blocks could be the remnants of a large-scale gene
or even entire genome duplication event. Furthermore,
the presence of a high number of very small duplicated
blocks could point to an ancient duplication event followed by a large number of genome rearrangements
breaking up larger blocks. If this were true, we would
expect to find even more blocks with only two homologous genes.

Finding small duplicated blocks of genes

Since i-ADHoRe and most other methods for duplicated
block detection have been developed specifically to
report large homologous segments between or within
genomes [23], we developed a new approach to detect
small duplicated blocks of only two or three homologous
genes, referred to as 2HOM and 3HOM blocks, respectively (see Methods and Figure 1, Panel A and B). As can
be seen in Figure 1 (Panel B), 2HOM blocks can be part of
a 3HOM block, which is different from for example iADHoRe or related software reporting only the longest
blocks. Similarly, our 3HOM blocks can be part of a block
with more than three homologous genes. A genome that
has been recently duplicated and did not undergo extensive genome rearrangements will have almost no blocks
of only two or three anchor points using the i-ADHoRe
approach because most of them will be part of a larger
block. However, in our new strategy such a genome will
count numerous 2HOM and 3HOM blocks, indicative of
a large-scale duplication event. In this respect, we can
compare the distribution of 2HOM and 3HOM blocks
between duplicated and non-duplicated genomes, trying
to reduce the effect of genome rearrangements and the
breaking up of larger duplicated blocks. It should be
noted that blocks comprised of gene families with more
than 100 members were discarded from all further analyses.
Because we are looking at very small duplicated blocks,
the possibility of finding some of those by chance is
greater than for larger blocks. Therefore, in our block
detection method, we have chosen to be more stringent
by not allowing any intervening genes. Moreover, to compare our observation with what could be expected by
chance, we ran 1000 simulations for every genome, i.e.
every genome was shuffled 1000 times and for each random genome the number of 2HOM and 3HOM blocks
was counted. The results for the 2HOM block detection
in the three different Phytophthora species are shown in
Figure 2A, where the pink triangle shows the number of
blocks found in the real genome, while the distributions
shown in blue represent the results for random data, i.e.
the output of the 1000 simulations. If the number of
blocks found in the real data is clearly different from the
number of blocks found in the randomizations, the number of blocks in this species is highly significant, meaning
that we find more blocks than we would expect by chance
alone. As can be seen in Figure 2A, the number of 2HOM
blocks detected in all three Phytophthora species is significantly different from what would be expected by chance
alone. The same is true for the 3HOM blocks (Figure 2B),
where we can also see that 3HOM blocks without intervening genes are extremely rare in randomized genomes.
Moreover, as expected, in all three Phytophthora

Page 3 of 16

genomes the number of 2HOM blocks is much higher
than the number of 3HOM blocks (Table 1).
Because the number of small duplicated blocks in Phytophthora genomes seems unexpectedly high, we compared them with the number of blocks found in other
genomes, which we will further refer to as the reference
genomes. We distinguished three types of reference
genomes, i.e. those of organisms that (i) underwent at
least one WGD in their evolutionary past (Arabidopsis
thaliana [26,27], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [28,29], Homo
sapiens [30], and T. nigroviridis [31,32]), (ii) underwent
segmental duplications (C. elegans [33-36], P. falciparum
[37] and K. lactis [38,39]), (iii) most likely have not been
duplicated (P. tricornutum, D. melanogaster and A. gambiae). For all organisms, we applied the same detection
strategy. The results for the detection of 2HOM and
3HOM blocks are shown in Table 1.
Figure 3A shows the results of the 2HOM block simulation analyses for all genomes (for a detailed overview, see
Additional file 1). Again, the colored triangles represent
the number of blocks that we find in the real genomes,
while the corresponding distributions represent the 1000
simulations for every genome. As can be observed, there
are three clusters of organisms that can be discerned: one
formed by the reference species that have not undergone
large-scale gene duplication events, one by the three Phytophthora species, human and C. elegans, and one by Arabidopsis and Tetraodon. These latter two organisms show
an extremely high number of 2HOM blocks, which is
explained by the fact that both Arabidopsis and Tetraodon have undergone multiple rounds of WGDs. For
instance, it has been shown recently that the Arabidopsis
genome has undergone at least three WGD events, two of
which have occurred during the last 70 or so my [26,27].
Ray-finned fishes, such as Tetraodon, have undergone a
WGD about 300 mya, after their divergence from the
land vertebrates [31,32]. On top of that, they share two
rounds of earlier genome duplications with the other vertebrates [40]. So, all organisms for which it has been
clearly demonstrated that they have doubled their
genome during their evolutionary past show a very high
number of 2HOM duplicated blocks. The only exception
is the yeast S. cerevisiae, which has undergone a WGD
100 mya [28,31]. However, when we correct for the number of genes in the genome, this discrepancy disappears
(see further).
Table 1 summarizes the results of the detection of the
3HOM blocks in the Phytophthora and reference
genomes (for a detailed overview, see Additional file 2).
Next to A. thaliana, P. infestans has the highest number
of 3HOM blocks. The number of 3HOM blocks in the
other two Phytophthora species is much lower, but still
higher than in S. cerevisiae.

2HOM block detection

3HOM block detection

There is no evidence that the genome of C. elegans has
been duplicated. However, it has been shown that this
genome has undergone segmental duplication [33-36],
which explains its relatively large number of 2- and
3HOM blocks. To investigate whether many small blocks
in the Phytophthora genomes could also be explained by a
few segmental or chromosomal duplications, we calculated the percentage of genomic scaffolds containing at
least one small duplicated block. After removal of large
gene families, 66, 67 and 61% of the P. infestans, P. sojae
and P. ramorum scaffolds, respectively, contain at least
one block. When we count the number of scaffolds with
two up to 60 duplicated blocks, the number of scaffolds in
all three Phytophthora species gradually decreases when
the number of detected blocks increases (see Additional

file 3). Moreover, we observed that the number of blocks
detected on a scaffold is linearly correlated with the size
of the scaffold, expressed in the number of genes (see
Additional file 4). Finally, in order to make sure that the
small duplicated blocks are not operon-like structures,
we considered functional clustering and intergenic distances within the duplicated blocks (see Additional file 5).
The results of these analyses rejected the operon-hypothesis (see Additional file 5 and Additional file 6).
Dating the block duplications

The identification of many segmental duplications is usually considered strong evidence for a WGD, although it is
hard to rule out that they are the result of many independent segmental duplications. However, if one can show

that most gene duplicates have been created at about the
same time, this provides additional evidence for a single
duplication event [23]. Therefore, we have tried to date
the Phytophthora paranomes based on third codon or
synonymous substitution rates (or Ks-estimation, see
Methods). Because most substitutions in third-codon
positions do not result in amino-acid replacements, the
rate of fixation of these substitutions is expected to be relatively constant in different protein-coding genes [41]
and, therefore, to reflect the overall mutation rate [42].
As can be seen in Figure 4 (grey line), the most recent
speciation event is the divergence between P. ramorum
and P. sojae. Prior to this event, P. infestans diverged from
the common ancestor of P. sojae and P. ramorum (grey
dotted line), which is in accordance with phylogenetic
data [43]. Because of the fact that we only find small

duplicated blocks, possibly because of many genome
rearrangements (see further), many paralogs that arose
through this large-scale duplication event will no longer
lie in duplicated blocks. Therefore, we not only dated the
homologous gene pairs still residing in duplicated blocks
(Figure 4, dark blue shading), but also dated the whole
paranome of the three species (Figure 4, light blue shading). As shown in Figure 4, both distributions have the
same shape (it should be noted that the absolute values of
the 'paranome' distribution are of course much higher). It
is clear that in all three species there is a peak around KSvalues of 1.5-2.0. Although we are aware that higher values of KS should be interpreted with caution due to saturation effects, it is clear that many paralogs arose around
the same time in the three species and prior to two speciation events, and must thus have occurred in their com-

sojae and P. ramorum still share 24 2HOM blocks (i.e.,
11.6% resp. 18.8% of the total number of P. sojae resp. P.
ramorum 2HOM blocks). P. sojae and P. ramorum also

We also studied gene orientation conservation in the Phytophthora and reference genomes. To this end, we have
applied the strategy shown in Figure 1 (Panel C and D). In
Panel C, the possible situations are shown where the orientation of the genes in 2HOM blocks is completely conserved. Since it is possible that during a WGD whole
regions are being inverted, the different possibilities
shown in Panel D are also considered conserved. All the
other cases, where only one gene is inverted and the other
one not etc., we define as the orientation not to be conserved. We have applied this strategy to all the genomes
in our dataset and again ran 1000 simulations for every
species. As can be seen in Figure 2C, 77% of the 2HOM
blocks in P. infestans have a conserved gene orientation
(pink triangle), whereas the conserved orientation in the
reshuffled genomes is much smaller (blue line). In P. sojae
and P. ramorum the conservation percentage is slightly
lower, but still higher than in random data. In A. thaliana,
T. nigroviridis and H. sapiens, again the situation is similar as in Phytophthora, although in human and Tetraodon
the percentages are a bit higher (see Additional file 7). In
C. elegans and D. melanogaster the conservation percentages are just below 50 and at the tail of the simulation
curve. Also in A. gambiae the conservation percentage is
at the tail of the random curve. For the other genomes it
is difficult to conclude anything because there are too few
data points. This is also the reason why this simulation
analysis was not performed on the 3HOM blocks.
The fact that the blocks in the Phytophthora species
have a conserved orientation provides further support for
the homologous gene pairs to have been duplicated in
concert. If the homologous gene pairs would have been
duplicated separately and afterwards assembled into gene
clusters for example, then the genes within the block
could have easily been inverted, resulting in a non-conserved gene orientation within the block. Also Cavalcanti
and colleagues showed that in yeast the number of blocks
with the same gene order was similar to the number of
blocks with the same gene order and gene orientation,
while in C. elegans the number of blocks dropped substantially after imposing the orientation criterion [44].
Gene retention following duplication in Phytophthora

Besides block duplicates, also the number of tandem
duplicates is large in the Phytophthora genomes. In
pathogenic species, it is well-known that genes related to
pathogenesis are often located in tandem arrays (for
example [19,45-47]. In a previous study, this was for
example observed for P. falciparum, but also for both P.
sojae and P. ramorum [19]. To see whether there is a simi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/353

lar bias in gene function for genes retained in the 2- and
3HOM blocks, we calculated GO Slim enrichments (see
Methods) for both the tandem and block duplicate datasets. Table 2 shows the GO Slim labels that are significantly (Q-value < 0.05) enriched in (i) tandem duplicates,
(ii) block duplicates, and (iii) in both tandem and duplicates.
As expected, and previously shown [19], tandem duplicates are enriched in genes related to pathogenesis, such
as genes involved in symbiosis and genes with specific
kinase activity. Moreover, 25% of all genes annotated with
the GO-term "symbiosis" are part of tandem gene clusters
(see Table 2). When we consider the GO-tree Cellular
Component (C), we observe that tandem genes are often
expressed in lysosomes, vacuoles, the external encapsulating structures, the cell wall and the extracellular
region, which refers to the outermost structure of a cell
(or the host cell environment in the case of an intracellular parasite).
The block duplicates are specifically enriched in the
processes cell communication and signal transduction
and in the functions actin binding and calcium ion binding, signal transducer activity, transcription regulator
activity and receptor activity. Many of these functions,
such as signal transduction and transcription but also calcium binding have been shown in several studies to be
preferentially retained after a whole genome duplication
because of gene dosage and gene balance effects [48-53].
Therefore, the specific retention of these genes in the
small duplicated blocks in Phytophthora provides additional evidence for a WGD, rather than individual segmental duplications, where we would expect the opposite
[51]. Additionally, the retention of calcium binding, signal
transduction and cell communication proteins may also
have been important in the infection process of the plant
pathogen. It has been shown that the plant pathogen Phytophthora parasitica forms, at the site of infection, biofilms that contribute to disease development [54]. These
biofilms protect the pathogen against plant defence
responses and fungicidal treatments and use cell-cell
communication to promote the exchange of signals and
nutrients between, among others, sessile and planktonic
zoospores [54]. Calcium, for example, is one of the candidate substances responsible for the chemotaxis of zoospores toward previously encysted zoospores [55-57].
Furthermore, the encystment of zoospores and the germination of cysts to form hyphae is also stimulated by
nutrients and calcium (reviewed in [58]). Regarding the
GO-tree cellular component, we see no preference of
expression in the extracellular regions.
It is clear that both tandem and block duplicates are
enriched in genes that play a role in pathogenesis. Additionally, both types of duplicates are enriched in genes
that are important in the response to external, biotic and

abiotic stimulus and stress. Also genes with hydrolase,
transporter and catalytic activity, of which many are
linked to pathogenesis, are enriched in both categories of
duplicates. For example, genes of the glycosyl hydrolase
family encode extracellular enzymes capable of hydrolyzing the xyloglucan component of the host cell wall,
thereby facilitating the pathogen physical penetration
process [59]. Although the large majority of these wellknown pathogenicity genes [12,13] have clearly evolved
through a continuous process of tandem duplications, we
have now identified some of them as remainders of an
older large-scale duplication event.

Discussion
All three Phytophthora genomes contain many more
small duplicated blocks than would be expected by
chance alone. Furthermore, when we compare the number of duplicated blocks with those of organisms that
have most probably not undergone large scale duplication
events (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster or Phaeodactylum
tricornutum), the difference is obvious (see Figure 3 and
Table 1). Moreover, we also observed a clear difference
with organisms that did undergo some segmental duplications, but no WGD. For example, Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe human malaria,
carries multiple segmental duplications in the otherwise
highly variable subtelomeres of its chromosomes [37].
However, the number of 2HOM and 3HOM blocks
detected is still much smaller than in Phytophthora. Also
in K. lactis, a yeast species that has not undergone a
WGD, but for which eight segmental duplications have
been documented, on top of some segmental duplications
at the subtelomeres [39], the number of detected small
duplicated blocks is much less than in Phytophthora [38].
On the other hand, the number of 2HOM blocks in C.
elegans, which has undergone a few segmental duplications [36], is higher than in P. ramorum, but still considerably lower than in P. infestans and P. sojae. The number of
3HOM blocks on the other hand is higher than in P.
ramorum and P. sojae but still lower than in P. infestans.
However, it should be noted that the large number of
2HOM and 3HOM blocks in C. elegans is mainly due to a
few larger segmental duplications involving between 10
and 26 genes [36]. It is also important to note that the
duplicated blocks in all three Phytophthora species are
spread over more than 60 percent of the number of scaffolds and we did not observe a bias to certain scaffolds,
only a correlation between the size of the scaffold and the
number of duplicated blocks, something we would expect
for a WGD event. On the other hand, in C. elegans, 70%
of the segmental duplications are intrachromosomal [36].
Because the number of blocks is directly correlated
with, among other things, (i) the number of genes, (ii) the
extent of genome rearrangements, and (iii) the quality of

the genome assembly, we have to take these issues into
account. For example, as stated before, the number of
blocks in the paleopolyploid S. cerevisiae was lower than
expected. However, this is explained by the fact that,
compared to the other genomes used in this study, yeast
has much fewer genes. On top of that, S. cerevisiae has
undergone many rearrangements [28,38,60]. Figure 3B
shows the percentage of 2HOM blocks for the different
genomes analyzed, taking into account the number of
blocks that theoretically can be found if the whole
genome would have been duplicated and there would
have been no genome rearrangements (translocation,
loss, ...). In practice, if a complete chromosome (or scaffold in our case) with x genes has been duplicated, we
would expect to find (x-1) 2HOM and (x-2) 3HOM
blocks, provided none of the duplicated genes would have
been translocated or lost nor other genes inserted. By
dividing the number of identified blocks by the number
of possible blocks, we obtain the relative number of
duplicated blocks for all genomes (see Figure 3B and
Table 1). Regarding 2HOM blocks, all genomes that have

not undergone a large-scale duplication event, have values below 0.5%. The same is true for Plasmodium falciparum and Kluyveromyces lactis, which have only
undergone some segmental duplications. For the other
species, except S. cerevisiae, which are known to have
undergone at least one genome duplication, the percentages are all > 1.5%, including P. infestans (2.17%) and P.
sojae (1.91%). P. ramorum is just < 1.5% (1.47%), but there
are no non-duplicated or segmentally duplicated
genomes with a value larger than 1%. It should also be
noted that, when taking the number of genes into
account, the difference in the number of 2HOM blocks
between S. cerevisiae and the non-duplicated organisms
becomes larger. Also the percentage of blocks in all three
Phytophthora species is now greater than in C. elegans.
Moreover, the relative number of blocks in H. sapiens is
smaller than in P. infestans and P. sojae, and similar to P.
ramorum. Both Tetraodon and Arabidopsis still have the
highest relative number of blocks.
For the 3HOM blocks, the difference between organisms that have undergone large-scale duplications and

Martens and Van de Peer BMC Genomics 2010, 11:353
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/353

those that have not is even more pronounced (also see
Table 1). For all non-duplicated genomes, the percentages
are below 0.05%. When we consider the other genomes,
the relative number of 3HOM blocks in P. infestans is the
highest. For P. sojae and P. ramorum however, the percentages are lower than for Arabidopsis and Tetraodon,
similar to S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens and C. elegans, and
higher than for the other reference organisms.
It is important to realize that the genomes of all three
Phytophthora's still consist of scaffolds, whereas most
other genomes discussed here have already been assembled into chromosomes. If the majority of scaffolds are
rather small, it is obvious that it is much harder to detect
large duplicated regions than for genomes that are well
assembled (e.g. Arabidopsis, human, Tetraodon, Drosophila, ...). Therefore, we considered the distribution of
scaffold sizes (i.e. number of genes on an annotated scaffold) in the different Phytophthora species and compared
them with the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, a
genome that is also not yet assembled into chromosomes
(see Figure 5). For every size bin, we counted the percentage of genes of the corresponding genome located on a
scaffold of that size. In P. ramorum (blue histogram), we
observed that the percentage of genes lying on a small
scaffold (i.e. between 1 and 25 genes) is greater than for
the other genomes. Also when we consider the cumulative percentage (blue line), we see that all genes (i.e.
100%) are found on scaffolds with a size smaller than 400
genes, whereas in Phaeodactylum we have scaffolds with
more than 900 genes and in P. infestans with more than
1000 genes. The situation in P. sojae is similar to that of P.
ramorum, although slightly better. In Phaeodactylum, the
number of genes on small scaffolds is the lowest. Therefore because in Phaeodactylum the average scaffold sizes
are larger, it should be easier to detect larger duplicated
blocks. The fact that we could hardly find any duplicated
blocks in Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Table 1 and Additional file 8), whereas we do find many in P. infestans and
a considerable number in P. ramorum and P. sojae again
provides support for Phytophthora species having undergone a large-scale or even entire genome duplication
event. In addition, since the number of blocks found in
the three species is linearly correlated with the assembly
quality, it is likely that in P. ramorum and P. sojae the
duplication signal would be more similar to P. infestans
after improving the genome assembly.

Conclusion
Analyses of the Phytophthora genomes seem to suggest
that these organisms have undergone a large-scale gene
duplication or WGD in their evolutionary past. Likely,
this event has been shared by all three Phytophthora species, P. infestans, P. ramorum, and P. sojae and thus
occurred before their speciation. Although we cannot

Page 12 of 16

exclude that the many small duplicated blocks have been
created through many independent small block duplications, we do consider this less likely. First, when we calculate the age of the duplicated blocks a large fraction seems
to have originated at the same time and they seem to be
very old. If the many small blocks observed in the different Phytophthora genomes would have been created by a
continuous mode of segmental duplications, we would
expect to see an exponential decrease when plotting the
age of the duplicated blocks against their frequency (i.e.,
many young blocks, few old ones), which is not what we
observe [23,51]. It could still be that a majority of segmental duplications occurred in a short time interval in
the common ancestor of all three Phytophthora species,
but this scenario is certainly much less parsimonious than
a single WGD. Furthermore, the specific enrichment of
regulatory genes in the duplicated blocks provides additional support for a WGD, rather than many smaller segmental duplication events, after which where we would
expect strong selection against retention of such genes
[50-53,61-64].
Second, polyploids have already been identified within
several species of Phytophthora [65-69] and other oomycetes [70] providing additional support that P. infestans
could indeed be an ancient polyploid (with a now diploidized genome). The findings of Sansome (1977) suggested that P. infestans may exist in nature in the
tetraploid condition and that this tetraploid might be better adapted, for instance to cooler conditions [65]. The
author also claimed that the discovery of many pathogenic races of P. infestans [71] may be related to polyploidy in P. infestans [65]. The fact that we also find many
genes related to pathogenesis in our set of retained duplicates might actually confirm this hypothesis.
Therefore, we conclude that Phytophthora is most likely
an ancient polyploid. The fact that many small blocks are
found suggests that its genome has been heavily rearranged following the duplication event. Furthermore, the
observation that the Phytophthora genomes have a high
repeat content, and that the gene order conservation
between the genomes drops when the repeat content
increases [13], further suggests that those repeats have
played an important role in the rearrangement process.
Haas and colleagues (2009) also suggested that the high
rate of transposon activity must have occurred more
recently [13], supporting our hypothesis that the WGD
event has preceded the rearrangement processes. As a
consequence, after tens of millions of years of evolution,
and in particular for fast evolving genomes of pathogens,
the paucity of a considerable number of retained homologous gene pairs in close proximity makes it almost impossible to detect statistically significant collinear regions.
This might explain why no evidence has been found previously for WGD or large-scale segmental duplications in

the Phytophthora species [12,13]. However, our newly
developed strategy to look for large numbers of small
duplicated blocks and compare these with genomes of
other organisms for which the duplication past is better
known, might still unveil ancient polyploidy events.

Methods
Construction of the datasets and defining homologs

The predicted protein sequences of three Phytophthora
species, namely Phytophthora sojae (JGI, v1.1), Phytophthora ramorum (JGI, v1.1) and Phytophthora infestans (v1, http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/
phytophthora_infestans/) were downloaded, as well as
the predicted protein sets of Phaeodactylum tricornutum
(JGI, v1.0), Plasmodium falciparum (Plasmodb), Arabidopsis thaliana (TIGR, Release 5), Kluyveromyces lactis
(NCBI), Saccharomyces cerevisiae http://www.yeastgenome.org, Anopheles gambiae (Ensembl, Release 52),
Caenorhabditis elegans (Ensembl, Release 31.140), Drosophila melanogaster (Ensembl, Release 31.3e), Homo sapiens (Ensembl, Release 35) and Tetraodon nigroviridis
(Ensembl, Release 53).
If alternative splice variants were detected for one gene,
only the longest transcript was used. Also transposon-like
genes were removed based on homology with known trans-

posons retrieved from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence
Bank http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/ and the Swiss-Prot Protein KnowledgeBase http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/. To
identify homologous genes, a similarity search was performed for every genome (BLASTP [72]; E-value cutoff
E-10). Next, gene families were built with MCLBLASTLINE (Inflation Factor of 2.0; http://micans.org/mcl/,
[73,74].
Dating of paralogous and orthologous gene pairs

The fraction of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (KS) is used to estimate the time of duplication
or speciation between two paralogous resp. orthologous
sequences. All pairwise alignments of the paralogous or
orthologous nucleotide sequences belonging to a gene
family were made by using CLUSTALW [75]. Gaps and
adjacent divergent positions in the alignments were
removed. KS estimates were obtained with the CODEML
program [76] of the PAML package [77]. Calculations
were repeated ten times to avoid incorrect KS estimations
because of suboptimal local maxima. To exclude gene
pairs that can be the result of redundancy instead of
duplication, only gene pairs with a KS estimate higher
than 0.1 were considered for further evaluation.

Detection of (large) duplicated regions (> 2 genes)

Validation of small duplicated blocks

Duplicated regions in the Phytophthora and reference
genomes were identified with the i-ADHoRe software
[24]. Homologous gene pairs, defined by MCLBLASTLINE, served as an input for the i-ADHoRe algorithm.
Gene pairs of gene families with more than 100 members
were omitted from the analysis. The following parameters were used: gap size of 10 genes; cluster gap of 20
genes; P-value of 0,001; Q-value of 0.9 and a minimum of
three homologs to define a duplicated block.

To examine if the number of blocks that we observe is different from what we would expect by chance only, we ran
1000 simulations for every genome. In brief, in every
genome the tandem duplicates were remapped to the first
gene and the gene families with more than 100 genes
were removed. Next, every genome was shuffled 1000
times and each time the number of detected 2HOM and
3HOM blocks was counted. If the number of detected
blocks is greater in the real data than in random data, we
can conclude that the number of blocks found is significantly higher than we could expect by chance only.

Detection of tandem genes and small duplicated blocks (<
4 genes)

Based on the MCLBLASTLINE-output, the order of proteins on a scaffold was converted into an order of gene
families A, B, C, ..., while keeping track of the original
protein IDs (see Figure 1, Panel A). Scaffolds with fewer
than 6 genes were omitted from further analyses. To
define all existing gene family pairs that occur next to
each other in the genome, a window size of two was used
to scan every scaffold. Tandem gene family pairs were
excluded. Thus, in a string of, for example, A-B-C-C-B-A
we define AB (BA is remapped to AB) and BC (CB is
remapped to BC) as gene family pairs. CC is a tandempair so this pair was discarded for the block analysis and
analyzed separately. With the gene pairs identified this
way, we again scan every scaffold to count how many
times this gene pair was found. The search is also done
with a window size of 1 but when a pair is found, we move
with a window size of two for the next search step only, to
prevent that we would count AB two times in the example ABACD (remember that BA is remapped to AB).
Therefore, when we detect AB, we jump one window further to take AC as the next pair instead of BA. When a
pair is found more than once, we call it a block with two
homologs (or 2HOM block). Finally, for all gene pairs that
are detected more than once, a unique block ID is
defined. In a post-processing step, duplicated blocks
where at least one of the homologous gene pairs is a
member of a large gene family (> 100 genes) were omitted
from the analysis. Also duplicated blocks where one of
the gene pairs has a KS estimate lower than 0.1 were
removed to reduce the effect of redundancy. The gene
IDs and coordinates of the gene pairs located in 2HOM
blocks can be found in Additional file 8.
A similar strategy was applied to detect blocks with
three homologous genes or 3HOM Blocks (Figure 1,
Panel B). So ABC, ABB...BBBC and CBA are all remapped
to ABC. However, BAC is not remapped to ABC. Also
note that 2HOM blocks mean that there must be at least
two successive homologs, so in the set of 3HOM blocks,
the 2HOM blocks are also included. The gene IDs and
coordinates of the gene pairs located in 3HOM blocks
can be found in Additional file 9.

Conservation of gene orientation

For all 2HOM blocks, we compared the order of gene orientation between both homologous segments. If the gene
orientation and gene order were conserved between both
homologous segments (see Figure 1, Panel C) then we
concluded that the orientation is conserved. If the gene
order is inverted together with the orientation (see Figure
1, Panel D), then we also conclude that the orientation in
this block is conserved. In all other cases, we consider the
orientation as not conserved. The same analysis was done
on all randomized (shuffled) genomes created for the
block detection strategy.
GO annotation and GO enrichment

The proteins of all Phytophthora genomes were annotated using Gene Ontology (GO) [78]. In a first step, all
genes were annotated for protein function using InterProScan [79]. Next, the resulting InterPro annotation was
converted into GO annotation. Proteins mapped to a particular GO category were also explicitly included into all
parental categories. All GO categories were also mapped
into the GO Slim categories. The statistical significance
of functional GO Slim enrichment was evaluated by using
the hypergeometric distribution, whereas multiple
hypotheses testing was done by using FDR [80].
