Abstract
Background: Macrohaplogroups 'M' and 'N' have evolved almost in parallel from a founder
haplogroup L3. Macrohaplogroup N in India has already been defined in previous studies and
recently the macrohaplogroup M among the Indian populations has been characterized. In this
study, we attempted to reconstruct and re-evaluate the phylogeny of Macrohaplogroup M, which
harbors more than 60% of the Indian mtDNA lineage, and to shed light on the origin of its deep
rooting haplogroups.
Results: Using 11 whole mtDNA and 2231 partial coding sequence of Indian M lineage selected
from 8670 HVS1 sequences across India, we have reconstructed the tree including Andamanesespecific lineage M31 and calculated the time depth of all the nodes. We defined one novel
haplogroup M41, and revised the classification of haplogroups M3, M18, and M31.
Conclusion: Our result indicates that the Indian mtDNA pool consists of several deep rooting
lineages of macrohaplogroup 'M' suggesting in-situ origin of these haplogroups in South Asia, most
likely in the India. These deep rooting lineages are not language specific and spread over all the
language groups in India. Moreover, our reanalysis of the Andamanese-specific lineage M31 suggests
population specific two clear-cut subclades (M31a1 and M31a2). Onge and Jarwa share M31a1
branch while M31a2 clade is present in only Great Andamanese individuals. Overall our study
supported the one wave, rapid dispersal theory of modern humans along the Asian coast.

Background
Variability in human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) offers
valuable information to trace the genetic history of
humans, because of the high rate of mutation and absence
of recombination. Analyses of the frequency of variation
and distribution of mtDNA haplogroups have been used
to evaluate current models concerning the process of col-

onization of world. South Asia, particularly India, lies on
the path of the earliest human dispersal from Africa [1,2]
and hence this holds an important site of information on
early human migrations.

mtDNA studies based on HVS I in Indian populations
have been carried out, and some information have been
made available about the genetic structure of Indian gene
pool [3-9]. Macrohaplogroup N in India has already been
defined [10], and recently the macrohaplogroup M
among the Indian populations has also been characterized [11].
The origin of mtDNA macrohaplogroup M has been an
issue of controversy. Macrohaplogroup M is found mainly
in Asia, and its various clades makeup the great majority
of Indian and Mongoloid lineages. It was hypothesized
that its high frequency and diversity in Ethiopia may indicate an African origin for the entire M [14]. Nevertheless,
M is geographically limited to Africa, while it is prevalent
in Asia. If M originated in Africa, then it must have
occurred at an ancient time, since it had to spread
throughout Asia and the New World. However, it is paradoxical that M crossed such a vast distance and failed to
accomplish other populations of Africa, except Ethiopians
and few Egyptians. The lack of time depth and classification of subhalogroups in the case of most of the lineages
in the recent paper [11] tends us to reconstruct the phylogeny of macrohaplogroup M, which harbors more than
60% of the Indian mtDNA lineage [1,3-9].

Results and discussion
In this study we defined one novel haplogroup M41, and
revised the classification of haplogroups M3, M18, and
M31. The remaining haplogroups are also classified into
subhaplogroups (M3a, M4a, M6b, M33a, M34a, M37a
and M40a) by including our complete sequence information (Fig. 1 and also see Additional file 1). The geographical distributions of these samples with their haplogroup
affiliation are given in Fig. 2 and the populations and their
linguistic affiliations are described in Table 1.
We have revised the classification of haplogroup M3 that
was previously characterized by a coding region mutation
4580 and two control region substitutions 482 and
16126. In our survey of >5000 samples across India, we
found a considerable number of samples that have mutations at nps 482 and 16126 but don't have mutation at
4580 (our unpublished data). This suggests that 482 and
16126 are the basal mutations of this haplogroup, and
4580 might have originated later and this represent subhaplogroup M3a. Haplogroup, M18 was previously characterized by only the HVS I mutation (16318T), but now
we have defined this haplogroup by two coding region
mutations (12498 and 15942), and an additional control
region mutation (194) (Fig. 1 and also see Additional file
1).
Further, we have defined several subhaplogroups based
on the sharing mutations between our own and Sun et al.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/151

[11] data [see Additional file 1]. Subhaplogroup M3a
defined by a coding region mutation at 4580, M4a
defined by two coding (6620 and 7859) and three control
region (152, 16145 and 16261) mutations. Subhaplogroup M6b defined by two coding region mutations
(3486 and 5585). M33a defined by two coding substitution (8562 and 15908); and M34a by six coding region
(3447-8404-10361-11992-12311-14094) and three control region (146, 16095 and 16359) mutations. M37a
defined by a single coding (7853) and two control region
(151-152) mutations. M40a defined by a coding (13542)
and three control region (200, 16179 and 16294) mutations. Interestingly, haplogroups M4, M18, M30, M37 and
M38 shared a common coding region mutation (12007)
from the root of haplogroup M (superhaplogroup M4'30)
and later differentiated by coding and control region
mutations (Fig. 1 and also see Additional file 1). We have
defined one novel haplogroup, designated as M41, by six
coding (870-6297-12398-12469-13656-15601) and
three control (375, 16327 and 16330) region mutations
with the T159 sequence of Sun et al. [11] (Fig. 1 and also
see Additional file 1). M41 has also been tentatively classified in three subhaplogroups M41a, M41b and M41c.
One complete sequence O9 from Andamanese specific
haplogroup M31a has also been included here that
defines subhaplogroup M31a1 by a single coding (13710)
as well as a control region (200) substitution. Our reanalysis of this lineage suggests population-specific two clearcut subclades of M31a in this island. M31a1 specific
mutations 200 and 13710 are exclusively present in Onge
and Jarwa populations while 9617 defining M31a2 clade
is present in only Greater Andamanese individuals [see
Additional file 1]. All the coding region diagnostic mutations of macrohaplogroup M subhaplogroups are listed in
Table 2.
We have also calculated the age estimates for all M
branches (Fig. 1) both by using the estimated mutation
calibration rate of Mishmar et al. [16], which has been
recently applied in most of the mtDNA studies [1,2,17],
and ρ (the averaged distance to a specified founder haplotype) and a mutation rate of one transition per 20,180
years between nps 16090–16365 [18]. Standard errors for
coalescence time calculation were calculated following
Saillard et al [19]. We found some conflict between the
age estimated by both of the methods. Since, the complete
sequences do not reflect the actual population size and
geographical distribution, former method [18] has been
used for colescent time estimation. The detailed coalescent time list is given in Additional file 2.
It is interesting to note that most of the new M lineages are
deep rooting, and more likely arose in situ in the Indian
subcontinent just after the arrival of the anatomically
modern humans (Fig. 1). As shown in the figure 1, it is

apparent that all the autochthonous lineages under analysis emerge directly from the root of the macrohaplogroup M. There is no intermediate lineage shared by any
two haplogroups, except for haplogroup M4'30 (Fig. 1).
The star-like and non-overlapping pattern (Fig. 1) indicates that all the lineages have originated independently
from the root of the macrohaplogroup M, thus supporting
a rapid dispersal of modern humans along the Asian coast
after they left Africa, followed by a long period of isolation
[2].

Conclusion
In summary, based on well-resolved mtDNA macrohaplogroup M phylogeny, it can be confirmed with the recent
studies [1,2] that a rapid dispersal of modern human took
place in one wave along the Asian coast. The deep roots of
M phylogeny clearly ascertain the relic of Indian lineages
as compared to other M sub lineages suggesting 'in-situ'
origin of these sub-haplogroups in South Asia, most likely
in India. These deep rooting lineages are not language specific and spread over all the language groups in India.

Moreover, our reanalysis of Andamanese-specific lineage
M31 suggests population specific two clear-cut subclades.
Onge and Jarwa share M31a1 branch while M31a2 clade

Methods
A phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the data of Sun et
al [11] including our complete sequence information of
11 complete sequences and 2231 partial Indian samples
possessing M selected from 8670 HVS sequences across
India to resolve some of the anomalies arising due to

recurrent mutations in the control region. The geographical distributions of the samples that are used for the complete sequencing of mtDNA are given in table 2. We
followed the experimental procedures, quality control
measures and haplogroup nomenclature described in our
previous study [1]. We have made the parsimonious tree
by using our own data and data published elsewhere [1113,15,21,22]. The maximum parsimonious tree obtained
by this procedure is shown in the figure 1 and Additional
file 1.
