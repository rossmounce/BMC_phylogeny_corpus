Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a worldwide health problem with no vaccine and the only approved therapy is
Interferon-based plus Ribavarin. Response prediction to treatment has health and economic impacts, and is a multifactorial problem including both host and viral factors (e.g: age, sex, ethnicity, pre-treatment viral load, and dynamics of
the HCV non-structural protein NS5A quasispecies). We implement a novel approach for extracting features including
informative markers from mutations in the non-structural 5A protein (NS5A), specifically its Interferon sensitivity
determining region (ISDR) and V3 regions, and use a novel bioinformatics approach for pattern recognition on the
NS5A protein and its motifs to find biomarkers for response prediction using class association rules and comparing the
predictability of the different features.
Results: A total of 58 sequences from sustained responders and 94 from non-responders were downloaded from the
HCV LANL database. Site-specific signatures for response prediction from the NS5A protein were extracted from the
alignments. Class association rules were generated (e.g.: sustained response is associated with position A2368T in
subtype 1a (support 100% and confidence 52.19%); in subtype 1b, response is associated with E2356G/D/K (support
76.3% and confidence 67.3%).
Conclusion: The V3 region was a more accurate biomarker than the ISDR region. Subtype-specific class association
rules gave better support and confidence than profile hidden Markov models HMMs scores, genetic distances or
number of variable sites, and would thus aid in the prediction of prognostic biomarkers and improve the accuracy of
prognosis. Sites-specific class association rules in the V3 region of the NS5A protein have given the best support and
confidence.
Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive single stranded
enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It causes a persistent infection in immune-competent
individuals [1]. Its major sequel is chronic active Hepatitis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
It is a major concern for the future world health and
development as it infects ~3% of the world population,
and has no vaccine [2]. The only approved combined
therapy of pegylated Interferon plus Ribavarin has limited

success (80% for genotypes 2 & 3 and 50% in genotypes 1
& 4). Factors influencing response can be classified into
viral, e.g. the baseline viral load, the genotype, and the
viral quasispecies heterogeneity [3,4], and host which can
be further divided into general parameters like age, sex,
contamination period, liver fibrosis and cellular factors
including genetic polymorphisms in cellular immunological proteins [5].
The NS5A is a multidomain phosphoprotein [6]; an
integral part of the virus replicase complex[7]. It is
involved in protein interactions with cellular proteins
including cytokines, growth factors, oncoproteins, and
signalling proteins, for a review see (Macdonald and Har-

ris, 2004; and Reyes, 2002) [8,9]. NS5A also antagonizes
numerous cellular pathways, including the antiviral interferon-α response pathway [10], and the jack stat pathway
as part of the counter attack mechanisms employed by
the virus [6]. Site-specific substitutions, higher genetic
distances, and number of variable sites in the ISDR and
the V3 regions as well as dynamics of the NS5A quasispecies after 4 weeks of therapy all showed correlation with
favorable response to treatment [3,11,12]. This indicates
the superiority of viral factors in determining the
response result [13]. Genetic markers from the virus proteins are important to consider in view of the immunological nature of the Hepatitis C virus disease and the
many reports confirming the importance of virusimmune system interactions for determining response
outcome. But, first, some general comments on bioinformatics and data mining are necessary.
Data mining has been defined as the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from data. Classification is a classic data
mining task, with roots in machine learning. Associative
classification aims to detect relationships between categorical variables and large datasets. This enables identification of hidden patterns in large databases. Associative
classification aims to discover a small set of rules in the
database, called class association rules, to form an accurate classifier. The accuracy of the rules is measured by
their support (relative frequency of the body or head of
the rule) and confidence (conditional probability of the
body given the head of the rule). Several algorithms have
been implemented in association rule mining including
the A-priori algorithm, the frequent item set mining algorithm (COFI) [14].
Bioinformatics as a subdescipline of data mining aims
to improve our current knowledge and understanding of
biological and molecular entities. Pattern recognition and
representation of motifs is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics and bioinformatics for diseases. The need
arises for methods that can find discriminative patterns
between closely related set of sequences that exhibit different phenotypes such as virulence, drug resistance, etc.
It is important to capture very subtle variations, which
are discriminatively powerful, and leave out unimportant
statistically insignificant variations between the sets of
sequences. Different approaches for pattern representations from sequence data include regular expressions,
position weighted matrices, sequence logos, profile hidden Markov models, etc. All these have been used in several motif databases (e.g.: PFAM [15]).
In silico approaches for motif identifications and representations have tremendously helped to guide in vitro
and in vivo experiments. DNA and protein motifs that
were discovered in silico could be verified as signatures

for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment for
several pathogens and cancer.
In this work, we apply a novel bioinformatics approach
for signature extraction, feature selection and classification; mining NS5A sequences from the HCV LANL database for response biomarker prediction. Informative class
association rules with a certain threshold of support and
confidence were generated to improve prognosis prediction. Pattern and variability analysis on the NS5A protein,
and specifically on its most important motifs for IFNtherapy response, namely the ISDR and V3 regions are
performed. The rational was that new molecular markers
are needed to improve current criteria for IFN-therapy
inclusion and prognostic prediction. An efficient comparison of the ISDR and V3 regions, and the three studied
subtypes (1a, 1b, and 3a) was also due. Finally, a comparison between the results of the applied techniques is conducted.
Prognosis prediction will help in personalising the
treatment for HCV patients, reducing the side-effects
and high costs associated with IFN treatment therapy
choice in view of the number of specifically targeted antiviral treatment (STAT-C) inhibitors that will be available
soon. Up to our knowledge, pattern analysis and classification modelling in the study of response to IFN based
treatment for HCV has not been done before. Our workflow for finding markers for response to IFN is composed
of sequence collection and sorting, multiple sequence
alignments, informative site identification and feature
selection by using relative Shanon entropy, comparative
sequence logos, and viral epidemiology signature pattern
analysis (VESPA) for positional enumeration of amino
acids in each group followed by generation of class association rules followed by selection of the best set of rules.

Materials and Methods
Sequence Collection and Analysis

We downloaded all available annotated HCV NS5A
sequences from subtypes 1a, 1b, and 3a from the HCV
LANL database [16] (See Table 1). Factors affecting the
response to therapy like sex, age, basal viral load are randomly distributed. The sequences were annotated with
information about genotype, country, and outcome of
IFN therapy [17]. Sequence manipulations were performed using JALVIEW [18], and BIOEDIT [19]. They
were grouped according to response type and subtype
and the ISDR and V3 regions extracted. These regions
were studied due to their significant correlations for
response to therapy. Multiple sequence alignmnets were
performed using MUMMALS [20] and sequences were
compared against their consensus.

The number of sequences in each genotype and response group is shown; variable sites and mean genetic distance are calculated. The number
of variable sites was extracted from the alignments, and mean genetic distances within and between groups were calculated using the MEGA
program.

Variability and Phylogeny Analysis

Tree reconstruction for each subtype and region was
done using the PROTDIST from the PHYLIP package
[21], and the MEGA 4.0 software [22]. Genetic distances
within and between groups were also calculated using the
MEGA 4.0 program.
Pattern Discovery and Feature Selection

Detecting the most statistically significant differences
between the responder and non- responder groups was
done using the VESPA [23] available from the HCV database which gave the most variable positions and their frequencies between responders and non-responders. Class
association rules were generated from these tables. Relative Shanon entropy was calculated using the tool from
the great facilities available from the HCV LANL database. Statistically significant variations were calculated
with a threshold of P = 0.05.
The two Sample sequence logo [24] server was also
used to identify and confirm significant variations
between the two groups for each subtype and statistical
significance assessed.
Profile HMMs for the responder and the nonresponder groups were performed using the
HMMBUILD program from the HMMER package
[25,26]. Class association rules were generated for the
sites with statistically significant variations between the

two groups in both the comparative sequence logo and
the relative Shanon entropy and those whose support and
confidence are above 50% were retained.
The association rules were tested on a 10% subset of the
sequences. The HMM search tool available from the
HMMER package was also used to score the test
sequences against a profile HMM and the prediction
accuracy noted. The threshold genetic distances scores,
HMM scores, and number of variable sites used for rule
generation were inferred and class association rules were
generated.

Results
Patients' Sequences and Variability Analysis

A total of 58 sequences from sustained responder
patients (R) and 94 sequences from non-responder
patients (NR) were downloaded (Table 1). Protein multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for sequences ofrespondersand non-responders were performed together
and then sequences of the ISDR and V3 regions were
extracted. The resulting MSAs are the corner stone for
subsequent analysis and for building the classifier. Figure
(1) shows the ISDR and V3 region alignments and conserved positions for subtype 1b. The resulting MSAs are
the corner stone for subsequent analysis and for building
the classifier. Distance based trees for each genotype and
region are shown in additional file 1- figureS1. The trees

show no clear clustering based on response, and the longer branches are mingled within both groups as previously deduced in similar studies[27]. There were no
statistically significant correlation between the number of
variable sites, genetic distances between responders and
non-responders. For example, for the V3 region, there
were 19 number of variable sites inresponders compared
to 17 in non-responders (P = 0.86). In subtype 1a, the
mean genetic distances are 0.249 in responders compared
to 0.193 in non-responders (P = 0.35); while in subtype
1b, the mean genetic distances are 0.272 in responders
compared to 0.166 in non-responders (P = 0.09). The
number of variable sites and genetic distances in the V3
region were always higher than in the ISDR region (Table
1). Also, there was no statistical significance in number of
variable sites, or genetic distances in the ISDR region and
in the NS5A protein as a whole.
Patterns Discovery and Recognition

Positional variations in the ISDR and V3 regions were
compared using a number of tools: VESPA, Relative Shanon entropy, and comparative sequence logos (see methods for elaboration). Signatures for response prediction
were extracted from the MSAs using the VESPA tool (see
additional file 1 -table S1and S2). Results reveal that in
the ISDR region, the variations are small between the two
groups of responders and non-responders. The relative
entropy tool provided a different insight: The variations
between the two groups are compared at every position,
giving high scores for positions which are relatively variable in one group than the other. Results show that the
variability in positions swings between the two response
groups (sites with statistically significant variations (P <
0.05) are indicated with red in figure 2). Furthermore, the
higher variability in the positions of the V3 region compared to the ISDR region can be deduced.
Comparative sequence logos confirm the results of
VESPA and the relative Shanon entropy tool. The graphical motif representation enables a quick identification of
positions that are clearly different by their length, and can
therefore be incorporated in the classifier.
For the ISDR region: Subtype 1b showed the largest
number of variations, which all clustered in the responders group (10 positions are indicated in Figure 2). Four
positions coincided with the sequence logo results and
statistically significant (2217, 2227, 2228 & 2247) (Figure
3). Thus, these positions are confirmed. Position 2228 is
statistically significant in both subtypes 1a & 1b. For subtype 1a, there were 4 variable positions, 3 of them confirmed by the sequence logo (2228, 2234 & 2248) (Figure
3). There were no significant sites for subtype 3a.
In the V3 region, the following can be noted about site
considerable variations between the two groups of
responders and non-responders: There were four statisti-

cally significant sites (2356, 2358, 2374 and 2378) in the
V3 region of subtype 1b which were confirmed by filtering results of both the relative Shanon entropy (Figure 2)
and the comparative sequence logo (Figure 3). Similar
analysis showed that there was no confirmed marker in
subtype 3a and there were 4 positions in subtype 1a
(2365, 2367, 2376,2379). Position 2378 was significantly
variable between responders and non-responders in subtypes 1b and 3a.
There were 3 statistically significant variations in the
IRRDR regions (2326, 2342 and 2349 in subtype 1a; 2332,
2348 and 2383 in subtype 3a).
For the whole of the NS5A protein, discriminative variations clustered in the IRRDR region and its flanking
parts only.
No observable variations were present in other parts of
the NS5A protein, and in the 2'5' OAS binding region.
Comparing genotypes 1 & 3, the number of variable
sites, genetic distances, and statistically significant positions were lower in subtype 3a than 1a & b. The higher
variability in subtype 1b could also be attributed to the
diverse countries from which the patients came from.
Evaluation and Comparison of Different Biomarkers

The class association rules for each subtype were generated from the VESPA, relative Shanon entropy, and comparative sequence logos results. The support and
confidence of the class association rules have been calculated. The most informative rules with highest support
and confidence are: In the V3 region, sustained response
is associated with E2356G/D/K in subtype 1b (support
76.3% and confidence 67.3%), A2368T in subtype 1a (support 100% and confidence 52.19%). In subtype 1b, nonresponse is associated with wild type 2378T (support 50%
and confidence 69%). In the ISDR region: In subtype 1a,
non-response is associated with wild type 2248S (support
47.5% and confidence 95%).
We evaluated the genotype specific profile HMM models using responders and non-responders sequences.
Similar scores for responder and non-responder
sequences showed HMMs are not suitable for this kind of
problem. The comparison of the different approaches for
biomarker discovery is shown in Table 2. The table shows
the higher accuracy of site-specific class association rules
over other parameters.

Discussion
Our objective was to extract patterns that can discriminate between two sets of phylogenetically close but functionally different sets of sequences. According to our
results it is evident that variability is present in both
groups; there were red lines and long letters in both
response groups (Figures 2 and 3). Accordingly, an accurate measure which depends only on the variability would

not be efficient in separating responders from nonresponders. That's also why the profile HMMs, as maximum entropy models, didn't perform well.
The approach using class association rules extracted
from the VESPA results (see additional file 1- table S1 and

S2) and confirmed by relative Shanon entropy calculations and comparative sequence logos can help increase
the sensitivity and specificity of genetic biomarker discovery in general. These class association rules, which are
position and amino acid specific, proved more appropri-

ate and gave high support and confidence. The associative classification technique was chosen because it builds
more accurate and easily interpretable set of rules than
traditional classification approaches [28,29]. Analysis of
the genetic distance variations, VESPA, and relative Shanon entropy (Table 1, Figure 2 and Additional files 2 and
3) indicates the discriminative superiority of the V3
region over the ISDR region as a biomarker in the
response to therapy problem. This was also confirmed by

recent studies [30]. Subtype 3a showed lower overall variability and more homogeneity in both regions, with no
statistically significant variations, thus indicating its
higher rate for response. We correlated specific residues
in the V3 region whose support and confidence exceeded
both 50%. The previous structural and functional analysis
[6] showed that the V3 region is 100% exposed, and contains a hot loop region, therefore highly ranking it as a
protein binding motif. These mutations could limit the

In conclusion, prognostic biomarkers have been
extracted using this approach that would enhance prediction of response to IFN therapy in Chronic Hepatitis C
patients.

efficacy of the NS5A protein-host immune system proteins interactions in its counter attack mechanisms. Also,
non-response was associated with specific amino acids in
the V3 region which could be potential binding sites with
the immune system proteins. Analysis of variability failed
to accurately distinguish the response groups as these
disordered proteins are inherently variable, with little
effect by amino acid substitutions [31]. All three methods, VESPA, Shanon entropy, and comparative sequence
logos, coincided in their results for the most important
statistically significant variable positions between the two
sets. An automated pipeline of analysis that incorporates
these methods for signature extraction would aid in rapid
sequence biomarker discovery in general. This can help
physicians in drug type assessment as has been done with
HIV drug resistance [32].

Conclusions
We conclude that the IRRDR region is a better biomarker
for therapy response than the ISDR region. Indicative
biomarkers were extracted from subtypes 1a, 1b, and 3a,
which showed significant variation between the two
groups using a multi- bioinformatics approach for pattern
analysis. Subtype 3a showed lower overall variability and
more homogeneity in both regions, with no statistically
significant variations, thus indicating its higher rate for
response. Finally, comparing the results from pattern
based approaches to analysis of variability, it is evident
