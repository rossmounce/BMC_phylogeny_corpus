Abstract
Background: bZIPs are transcription factors that are found throughout the eukarya from fungi to
flowering plants and mammals. They contain highly conserved basic region (BR) and leucine zipper
(LZ) domains and often function as environmental sensors. Specifically, bZIPs frequently have a role
in mediating the response to oxidative stress, a crucial environmental signal that needs to be
transduced to the gene regulatory network.
Results: Based on sequence comparisons and experimental data on a number of important bZIP
transcription factors, we predict which bZIPs are under redox control and which are regulated via
protein phosphorylation. By integrating genomic, phylogenetic and functional data from the
literature, we then propose a link between oxidative stress and the choice of interaction partners
for the bZIP proteins.
Conclusion: This integration permits the bZIP dimerization network to be interpreted in
functional terms, especially in the context of the role of bZIP proteins in the response to
environmental stress. This analysis demonstrates the importance of abiotic factors in shaping
regulatory networks.

Background
Control of gene expression at the transcriptional level is
vital and several mechanisms exist that may regulate the
DNA binding of a transcription factor (TF). These include
differential heterodimer formation, methylation of the
DNA target site [1], phosphorylation in the TF DNA-binding domain (DBD) [2], reduction/oxidation (redox) of
the DBD [3], the concentration of cations (particularly
magnesium) in the nuclear environment [4]. A combination of differential heterodimer formation together with

the phosphorylation and the redox mechanisms may
yield complex behaviours that determine the expression
or inhibition of downstream targets. We are particularly
interested in the complex behaviour that these 3 mechanisms create in the bZIPs, since these TFs are involved in
cell proliferation and apoptosis.
bZIPs are eukaryotic TFs, found in fungi, plants and animals. They are named for the highly conserved basic
region (BR) and leucine zipper (LZ) domains, found in all

these proteins. Specifically, the bZIP domain is responsible for dimerization mediated by the LZ region and DNAbinding is mediated by the BR, which is N-terminal to the
LZ. Two mechanisms that control DNA binding by bZIP
dimers are phosphorylation and redox. This control is
mediated by specific and conserved amino acids in the BR
of the protein. Serine and cysteine residues mediate phosphorylation and redox, respectively, at position 19 of the
BR domain (Figure 1). We designate these residues as S19
and C19, respectively. Crystallographic analysis of various
bZIP proteins, like JUN-FOS, GCN4, PAP1 and C/EBPα,
has shown that the amino acids at this position make contacts with the DNA [5], [6].
Phosphorylation of S19 in BATF [7] and C/EBP [2] proteins has been shown to add a negative charge to the positive BR and inhibit binding with the negatively charged
DNA. Phosphorylation of only one of the two S19 residues in a heterodimer is sufficient to block DNA binding,
thus having a dominant effect (Figure 2). It has also been
postulated that the corresponding tyrosine residue (Y19)
in ATF4 could potentially be phosphorylated [7].
Another mechanism of switching on or off DNA binding
is the reduction/oxidation of the cysteine residue in position 19 of the BR of bZIPs (C19) [3], [8]. Oxidation of
C19 blocks DNA binding, and this mechanism has been
shown to operate for the AP1 proteins. Several mechanisms have been proposed or predicted for the oxidation
of C19, such as reversible formation of sulphenic acid, a
disulphide bond [9], S-glutathiolation [10], or S-cystenyl

Figure alignment of the DNA-binding BR of human bZIPs
Multiple1
Multiple alignment of the DNA-binding BR of human
bZIPs. Each protein sequence is a representative of a bZIP
family. The first part of the protein name designates the family, while the second part designates the specific protein. The
sequences are coloured by residue, using the default colouring scheme of ClustalX.

cystenylation [11]. Furthermore, C19 can either be protected from oxidation by the MBF1 co-activator [11], or it
can be switched back from its oxidised to its reduced state
by the ref-1 protein [8].
The importance of these two signalling mechanisms
(redox versus phosphorylation) is stressed by the conservation of the cysteine or serine at this position. Deppmann et al. [7] report 55% and 35% occurrence of cysteine
and serine, respectively, in position 19 in an alignment of
human bZIPs. Here, we provide a more detailed phylogenetic analysis using several vertebrate and invertebrate
species and highlight the level of conservation of these
amino acids, strongly suggesting functional conservation.
In addition to conservation at the sequence level, the
same cysteine residue and the redox mechanism have
been demonstrated experimentally in both human and
Drosophila AP1 proteins [3], [11], [12]. For the phosphorylation mechanism, the importance of S19 has been
shown experimentally for BATF and C/EBP proteins [2],
[7], [14]. In addition, mutation of the cysteine or serine in
position 19 does not affect heterodimerization properties
or DNA-binding recognition [3], [7], [12]. This mutation
appears to affect the selection of the signal (phosphorylation or oxidative stress) that turns on or off the DNA-binding ability of the dimer. Therefore, the conservation of the
amino acids in position 19, and the report of functional
conservation across different families, strongly indicates
that the same mechanism is preserved from Drosophila to
humans across many divergent evolutionary lineages.
In this work, we provide a visualization of the bZIP dimerization network and show the level of conservation of
C19 and S19 residues across different phylogenetic lineages. It has yet to be established experimentally, for all
bZIP proteins, whether they are under redox or phosphorylation control. However, given that all bZIP DNA-binding regions around the C19 and S19 residues have
fundamentally similar properties, and extrapolating from
experiments on JUN, FOS, C/EBP and BATF proteins, we
predict the bZIP proteins in which the redox and phosphorylation mechanisms are utilised. Based on these predictions, we propose that the control mechanism is linked
to the evolutionary history of the bZIP families. Interestingly, certain dimerization types are over-represented,
while others are under-represented – suggesting strong
preference for particular interaction patterns. Specifically,
C19 monomers tend to dimerize with other C19 monomers, probably in order to retain redox control and rarely
interact with other monomers. While dimerization with
other monomer types can occur, such dimers usually have
a repression function, so as to avoid inappropriate gene
expression.

Representation of the phosphorylation and redox control of DNA binding in bZIP dimers
Representation of the phosphorylation and redox control of DNA binding in bZIP dimers. Red-dotted monomers
contain C19, whereas blue-dotted monomers contain either S19 or Y19. C-C type dimers are very sensitive to oxidative stress
and cannot bind to DNA under these conditions. C-S and C-Y dimers are moderately sensitive to oxidative stress. Furthermore, C-S and C-Y dimers can be phosphorylated at S19 or Y19 to totally abolish DNA binding. S-S and S-Y dimers also totally
abolish DNA binding when phosphorylated at any of the S19 or Y19 residues. Phosphorylation behaves dominantly. To simplify
the graph, we excluded A19 monomers and dimers. A-A type dimers are neither controlled by redox nor by phosphorylation.
S-A type dimers are controlled by phosphorylation. No C-A or Y-A type dimers have been observed, see [19].

Results and discussion
The C19 residue of the BR alignment (Figure 1) is strikingly conserved in all vertebrates and invertebrates in the
ATF2, ATF3, NFE2, BACH, CREB, FOS, JUN, L-MAF, SMAF families (for a complete alignment of the BR
domains of all bZIP proteins, see Additional file 1). S19 is
also strikingly conserved in the ATF6, BATF, C/EBP, C/
EBP-γ, E4BP4, OASIS, OASIS-B and PAR families. Y19,
which could potentially be phosphorylated, is conserved
in the ATF4 family. The XBP1 family is the only family

that has a serine residue in the arthropods; this has been
mutated to an alanine residue in chordates, suggesting
loss of phosphorylation control in the BR. Interestingly,
we see the presence of serine and cysteine residues in fungal bZIPs as well as the presence of phenylalanine (F19),
which is restricted to the fungal lineage (Figure 3). This
phenylalanine is necessary for recognition of the yap
DNA-binding motif by the Yap proteins in fungi [15].
Nevertheless, the DNA-recognition property of this phenylalanine does not necessarily extend to the serine and

cysteine residues, since they have no aromatic ring that
can get stuck in the DNA. The presence of these particular
serine and cysteine residues in both metazoan and fungal
proteins emphasises the ancient nature of phosphorylation and redox control in bZIPs.
It appears that the highly conserved nature of these amino
acids is due to functional reasons (phosphorylation,
redox) and not due to size restrictions at the protein-DNA
interface. While cysteine, serine and alanine are all very
small amino acids, the presence of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the same position shows clearly that residue size
is not a major constraint. Cysteine and serine are only one
point mutation apart in the genetic code and so, if size
was the only constraint, we might expect these two amino
acids to occur with equal frequency at this site, even
within families. Thus, the conservation of the same amino
acid across all the family members, from vertebrates to
invertebrates (with the exception of only the XBP1 family)
strongly suggests that biochemical function is involved.

Phylogenetic analysis of the BR (Figure 3 &4) indicates
that the use of phosphorylation or redox control has
emerged several times, as the various bZIP families
emerged in early metazoan evolution. Therefore, it is
impossible to determine conclusively whether phosphorylation or redox control is the ancestral state at position
19.
The bZIP network is visualised in Figure 5. The bZIP
dimerization network does not have the same statistical
properties as all the other protein interaction networks
studied to date [16]. Unlike them, it is not described by a
power-law distribution (see figure 5), where the number
of genes with k interactions should decay exponentially.
We have previously described a network [17] of similar
magnitude (the bHLH dimerization network) that followed a power-law distribution and which seems to work
as a multi-switch [18]. In the case of the bHLH network,
the majority of the proteins need to heterodimerize with
one of the ubiquitously expressed hub proteins (eg. E2A,

ARNT) in order to form functional dimers. In contrast, in
the bZIP network, a large number of proteins can form
homodimers. Therefore, if the bZIP network is different,
what are its purposes and functions?
Integration of protein interaction data with sequence
analysis reveals the different types of dimers and how
many of them are formed in humans (Table 1). DNA
binding of all dimers that contain at least one S19 is prob-

ably controlled by phosphorylation. The same may also
happen for dimers that contain Y19, since this tyrosine
can potentially be phosphorylated [7]. All the dimers that
contain at least two C19 residues are probably controlled
by the redox mechanism. Dimers that contain only one
C19 should be deficient in redox control, according to
[12].

The bZIP dimerization network, integrating phosphorylation and redox information
The bZIP dimerization network, integrating phosphorylation and redox information. Circles, diamonds and rectangles represent proteins that can homodimerize, cannot homodimerize, or for which no interaction data are available
respectively. Proteins that contain C19 are coloured red, proteins that contain S19 or Y19 are coloured blue and proteins that
contain A19 are coloured black. Interactions (vertices) that form C-C type dimers are coloured red, interactions that form CX type dimers are coloured green, interactions that form S-S, S-Y or S-A type dimers are coloured blue. The bottom left diagram depicts the distribution of connectivity for the bZIP network, which does not appear to decay in a power-law.

The immediate question is whether there is a pattern to
the dimerization partners that is related to the phosphorylation and redox mechanisms. To test whether the distribution of different types of dimers is significantly
different from random (null hypothesis), a Chi-squared
test was used (Table 2). According to the null hypothesis,
the same number of proteins with the same frequency of
serine and cysteine residues could dimerize randomly.
Note, this statistical analysis must be treated with caution
since differential gene expression and protein expression
could distort the null hypothesis. By using the frequency
of each amino acid in the 43 human bZIPs for which
interaction data are available [19], we looked for all the
types of bZIP dimers that could potentially form if all
potential pairs were co-expressed. We were particularly
interested in the redox control and therefore focused on
the presence of C19-bearing dimers. We observed biases,
particularly an over-representation of C-C type dimers
that also resulted in an under-representation of C-X dim-

ers (dimers that contain only one C19) and vice versa
(Table 2).
It is conceivable that this under-representation of C-X
dimers is an artefact and this could have arisen in two different ways. Firstly, we explored the possibility that C19bearing proteins tend to homodimerize more than the
others. Secondly, we explored the possibility that C19bearing proteins tend to dimerize more with their closest
homologues, that is proteins of the same family that also
have a cysteine at position 19. In order to exclude biases
created by these two options, we also performed the chisquared test for heterodimers only, and for heterodimers
that are not close paralogues (Table 2). In both cases, the
over-representation of C-C and under-representation of
C-X dimers is statistically significant.
In the above statistical tests, we used all the paralogues of
each family. Nevertheless, most paralogues have similar
dimerization patterns. If position 19 is not actually linked

to the dimerization pattern, but is only responsible for
family-specific DNA core-site recognition, then gene
duplication (within a protein family) could have caused
an artefactual connection. In order to exclude this possibility, all the paralogues of each family were collapsed
into one such that the network was then composed of
interacting families. We retained the structure of the network among the families, but we shuffled the amino acids
of position 19 across the various families 10,000 times.
This model showed clearly that, in less than 2% of the
shuffled networks, did we obtain an under-representation
of C-X family dimers similar to that observed in the data
(11 or fewer families forming C-X dimer types) (see also
Additional file 2). Furthermore, we performed the same
analysis in other positions of the BR alignment (positions
9, 13, 15, 16, 23) that are also strongly conserved within
each family, but we did not observe any under/over-representation of amino acid combinations at a cut-off level of
5% (see also Additional file 2), in contrast to what we
observed for position 19. It should also be stressed that
the experimental evidence from [20] shows that mutation
of C19 did not affect DNA binding, DNA element recognition, or dimerization of the Zta bZIP protein.
Interestingly, it is apparent that the C-X heterodimer type
is not favoured. This can be explained by the dominant
nature of phosphorylation over redox control. The presence of only one S19 residue would be sufficient to place
the DNA-binding properties of the dimer under phosphorylation control. The loss or decrease of the redox mecha-

nism in the BR is known to increase the transforming
activity of the JUN-FOS heterodimer [12], [13]. Thus, it is
presumably important to retain the redox mechanism and
avoid heterodimerizing with other types (see Figures 4
&5).
What is the function of the C-type bZIPs that actually
dimerize with other types (X-types), thus forming C-X
type dimers and exhibiting insufficient redox control? By
examining the activation/inhibition activity of the X-type
partners in general, it appears that E4BP4 [21], p21-SNTF
[22] and BATF [7] have an inhibitory effect when dimerizing with other factors. In the case of E4BP4, this is due to
the active repression domain that it possesses. The cases of
ATF4, C/EBP-β and C/EBP-γ are more complex because
they can exhibit activating or inhibiting effects, depending
on post-translational modification [23], alternative splicing [24], or the cell type in which they are expressed [25].
Nevertheless, they do have the ability to function as inhibitors. It is reasonable to assume that, for C-type molecules,
it is generally acceptable to escape from the redox control,
as long as they dimerize with an inhibitor, or if the new
heterodimer cannot recognise and bind to promoters of
downstream targets that need to be controlled by the
redox mechanism – thus preventing uncontrolled activation of downstream targets.
Dimerization is an important mechanism for generating
complex behaviour with a limited number of protein
"building blocks". Work on other dimerizing TF families,

like the bHLH, has revealed a dimerization network with
a hub-based structure [17] that seems to work as a multiswitch [18], especially in development and the cell cycle.
A very different network structure was found for the bZIP
proteins, despite the fact that they share a similar crystal
structure with the bHLH proteins. Interestingly, there
seems to be a pattern in the formation of dimers in the
bZIPs (Figures 4 &5). These results indicate that environmental signals (and, particularly, oxidative stress) could
have imposed some selective pressure on the dimerizing
properties of these proteins. Alternatively, the dimerizing
properties of each monomer could have imposed some
pressure on the presence of cysteine or serine in position
19 of the BR. The redox mechanism has been implicated
in the regulation of DNA binding in other TF proteins:
p53, Sp1, NFI, NF-κB, PEBP2/CBF, the nuclear receptor
proteins (oestrogen and glucocorticoid receptors) and the
bHLH protein, USF (reviewed in [26]). When cells
undergo oxidative stress, the cell cycle is affected and it
seems that the redox control of cysteine residues in the
DNA-binding domain of various TFs is a simple (but very
efficient) mechanism of transducing environmental signals to the transcriptional machinery. In addition, oxidative stress has been implicated in the aetiology of several
human diseases, like cancer, ischemia, atherosclerosis,
neurodegenerative disorders and ageing (reviewed in
[27]). It will be of great interest to further enhance our
understanding of how this mechanism works and affects
other dimerizing TF families, like the bHLH and nuclear
receptors, determining whether this pattern is global or
restricted to the bZIPs.

Conclusion
The integration of genomic, phylogenetic and functional
data reveals a preference in the interaction partners of
bZIP proteins that is linked to oxidative stress. Specifically, bZIP proteins whose DNA binding is controlled by
redox tend to dimerize, with a frequency more than that
expected by chance, with other bZIP proteins that are also
controlled by redox. These results demonstrate that abiotic factors may play a major role in shaping regulatory
networks. While the dimerization networks of bHLH proteins and nuclear receptors are hub-based, that of the bZIP
proteins is not. Nevertheless we have demonstrated that
this network is not random. It follows a logic which
strongly links its structure with the network's functional
role in environmental sensing.

zation is represented by two different symmetrical (across
the diagonal) points in an interaction matrix. We considered an interaction as valid if its Z-score was greater than
2.5 in both directions, where the Z-score is a measure of
the signal-to-noise ratio [19].
bZIP sequences were obtained by genome-wide scanning
using custom-made HMMs [28]. The training of the HMM
models was based on protein sequences annotated as
bZIPs in the TRANSFAC database (version 4) [29]. Four
vertebrate (Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus, Takifugu rubripes,
Danio rerio), four invertebrate (Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster, Apis melifera, Anopheles gambiae) and
six fungal (Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Yarrowia lipolytica,
Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Candida glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genomes were scanned for
bZIP sequences. In addition, cnidarian bZIP sequences
were retrieved, using a keyword search, from the NCBI
protein database. The inclusion of a sequence as a bZIP
'hit' required both the presence of an LZ and a typical
DNA-binding region, as defined by [30] and the 2ZIP program [31]. This strict criterion was imposed because LZ
domains may appear by chance, due to abundance of the
leucine residue and the short length of the domain [32].
Multiple sequence alignments were performed for family
members with T-COFFEE [33] (Notredame et al., 2000)
and among different families using CLUSTALW [34]
(Thompson et al., 1994). The alignment was based on the
BR and LZ domain. Phylogenetic analysis (neighbourjoining) of the BR was performed by the PHYLIP package
[35], using the PROTDIST and NEIGHBOUR programs,
using the JTT model of amino acid replacement. The
neighbour-joining tree was visualised with TreeEdit [36].
Classification of bZIPs in protein families
We classified the 51 human bZIPs into 19 families, based
on the neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis of the BRLZ domain, combined with the distribution of orthologues and the domain architecture of the whole sequence
(G. D. Amoutzias, PhD Thesis, The University of Manchester, 2005). Specifically, the designations of our analysis were based on the presence of invertebrate orthologues
and distinct domain architectures for each family. The
new designations are: (1) the split of the OASIS family
into OASIS and OASIS-B, (2) the split of CNC family into
NFE2 and BACH, and (3) the split of the C/EBP family
into C/EBP and C/EBP-γ.

Methods
Protein-protein interaction data for all the human bZIPs
were taken from [19]. In that study, the coiled-coils of 43
out of the 51 human bZIPs that we had identified were
checked for the presence of an interaction with any of the
other bZIP coiled-coils. Each protein was used both as a
surface-bait and a probe. Therefore, a given heterodimeri-
