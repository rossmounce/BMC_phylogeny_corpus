Abstract
Background: The family of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) plays important roles in embryonic
development and in cellular responses to stress. Toxic metals and their compounds are potent
activators of JNK in mammalian cells. The mechanism of mammalian JNK activation by cadmium
and sodium arsenite involves toxicant-induced oxidative stress. The study of mammalian signaling
pathways to JNK is complicated by the significant degree of redundancy among upstream JNK
regulators, especially at the level of JNK kinase kinases (JNKKK).
Results: Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, we demonstrate here that cadmium and arsenite
activate Drosophila JNK (D-JNK) via oxidative stress as well, thus providing a simpler model system
to study JNK signaling. To elucidate the signaling pathways that lead to activation of D-JNK in
response to cadmium or arsenite, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down thirteen
upstream regulators of D-JNK, either singly or in combinations of up to seven at a time.
Conclusion: D-MEKK1, the fly orthologue of mammalian MEKK4/MTK1, and Hemipterous/DMKK7 mediate the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite.

Background
Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are involved in
fundamental biological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and death, as well as in
various aspects of embryonic development, morphogenesis, inflammation, wound healing, and cellular responses
to stress [1-11]. The mammalian MAPK superfamily
encompasses the extracellular signal-regulated kinases
(ERK1 and ERK2), the p38 MAP kinases (p38α, β, γ, and
δ), the big MAP kinase (BMK1/ERK5), and the c-Jun NH2terminal kinases (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) [1-7]. The JNK
family of kinases is of particular importance for cellular

responses to stress [8-11]. Most somatic cells express JNK1
and JNK2, the expression of JNK3 being restricted predominantly to the brain [12,13]. While the single
homozygous deletions of either jnk1 or jnk2 in the mouse
revealed a significant functional redundancy between
JNK1 and JNK2, the compound jnk1-/-/jnk2-/- mutant mice
die before birth, thus revealing the non-redundant role of
the JNK family as a whole in development [14]. In addition to development, JNKs play important roles in mediating cellular responses to oxidative, genotoxic, ribotoxic,
and hyperosmotic stresses [3,15,16]. JNKs are activated
via phosphorylation by two upstream JNK kinases

as Rho, Rac, cdc42, Ras, and Ral) [22-25]. Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms of activation of JNK by a stressor
of interest necessarily involves the identification of
GTPase(s) and JNKKK relaying a stress-generated signal to
JNKK and JNK.
Toxic metals and their compounds (e.g. cadmium and
arsenite) are among the most potent activators of JNK [2628]. Antioxidants prevent or reduce the activation of JNK
by both cadmium and arsenite, suggesting that toxicantinduced oxidative stress is operative in the activation of
JNK by these agents [28]. However, the identification of
specific mammalian JNKKK-JNKK modules involved in
the activation of JNK by cadmium and arsenite has been
difficult due to the complexity and potential redundancy
of mammalian JNKKK.

on 6-well plates 2 days before treatments. Cells were left
untreated (Co) or received 10 µM or 100 µM CdCl2 (A), or
50 µM or 200 µM NaAsO2 (B). Treatments were done in
duplicates. Cells were harvested at the indicated times after

(JNKK), MKK4 and MKK7 [8,17]. In turn, JNKK are activated via phosphorylation by JNK kinase kinases
(JNKKK). To date, at least 13 mammalian JNKKK have
been identified, namely: (i) the MEK kinase (MEKK) family, containing 4 members, MEKK1, 2, 3, and 4 [18], (ii)
the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) [19], (iii)
the transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1
(TAK1) [20], and (iv) the family of mixed lineage kinases
(MLK), containing three subfamilies, namely the MLK
subfamily (MLK 1, 2, 3, and 4), the dual-leucine-zipperbearing kinase subfamily (DLK and LZK), and the zipper
sterile-α-motif kinase (ZAK) [21]. Clearly, the complexity
and specificity of JNK activation is executed mainly at the
level of JNKKK, as the number of different JNKKK exceeds
by far the number of JNKK. Upstream of JNKKK, the regulation of the JNK pathways is thought to be dependent on
the activity of various small GTP-binding proteins (such

The genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster possesses all JNKKK, JNKK, and JNK families present in the
mammalian genome, but represented, typically, by fewer
genes. For instance, the mammalian MEKK family is represented in Drosophila by a single member, mekk1/DMEKK1 [29]. The mammalian MLK family is represented
in Drosophila by 2 members, slpr/D-MLK and CG8789/DDLK [29]. The fruit fly orthologues of mammalian ASK1
and TAK1 are pk92B/D-ASK and tak1/D-TAK1, respectively [29]. The fruit fly orthologues of MKK4 and MKK7
are mkk4/D-MKK4 and hep/D-MKK7, respectively [29].
Finally, Drosophila contains only one JNK gene, bsk/DJNK [29]. This evolutionary conservation of JNK signal
transduction pathways among metazoans underscores the
fundamental importance of JNK in mediating inducible
stress responses.
With the above rationale in mind, we employed Drosophila S2 cells and the RNA interference (RNAi) technique (also known as "knock down" technique) for gene
silencing [30,31] to investigate the signal transduction
pathways mediating the activation of D-JNK by cadmium
and arsenite. We knocked down 13 upstream regulators of
D-JNK, either singly or in combinations of up to 7 at a
time. As a result of this approach, we demonstrate the
involvement of D-MEKK1 and D-MKK7 in the activation
of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite.

Results
Cadmium and arsenite activate D-JNK, D-p38 MAPK, and
D-ERK in Drosophila S2 cells
To elucidate the responses of Drosophila MAP kinases to
toxic metals, we employed S2 cells, an immortalized cell
line of larval hemolymph origin. Activation of MAP
kinases was assessed in immunoblot assays using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of D-JNK, Dp38 MAPK, and D-ERK. As shown in Fig. 1, both cadmium
and arsenite triggered the phosphorylation of D-JNK, D-

tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox®), a watersoluble derivative of vitamin E with antioxidant properties (not shown). We concluded, therefore, that as in
mammalian cells [28], cadmium and arsenite activate
Drosophila MAP kinases via ROS-dependent oxidative
stress. These findings underscore the usefulness of the fly
model to investigate cellular responses to environmental
pollutants of relevance to human cells.

Four million cells were plated in 1 ml DSFM per well on 6well plates 2 days before treatments. Cells were left

(left panel), or NaAsO2 (right panel). Twenty four hours

p38 MAPK, and D-ERK in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. As significant activation of the three MAP kinases
by either agent was achieved at relatively high doses (100
µM for cadmium and 200 µM for arsenite), we measured
the overall toxicity to S2 cells of these doses of cadmium
and arsenite. Figure 2 shows that 100 µM of cadmium triggered less than 40% cell death within 24 hours and that
200 µM of arsenite triggered ~50–55% cell death within
24 hours. Further experiments (Fig. 3) demonstrated that
both cadmium and arsenite caused detectable phosphorylation of all three MAP kinases at doses as low as 50 µM.
We concluded, therefore, that Drosophila MAP kinases
respond to concentrations of cadmium and arsenite
within and below the LD50 range of these agents.
Cadmium and arsenite activate Drosophila MAP kinases
via oxidative stress
To investigate whether reactive oxygen species (ROS)
mediate the activation of Drosophila MAP kinases by cadmium and arsenite, we employed pretreatment of S2 cells
with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a potent scavenger of
H2O2,·OH, and HOCl and a precursor for the biosynthesis of glutathione [32-37], prior to the addition of cadmium or arsenite. At physiological pH, NAC abolished
the ability of both cadmium and arsenite to trigger the
phoshorylation of D-JNK, D-p38 MAPK, and D-ERK (Fig.
3, compare lanes 2–7 to lanes 11–16), but had no effect
on the activation of D-JNK by sorbitol, an hyperosmotic
stressor (Fig. 3, compare lanes 8 and 9 to lanes 17 and 18).
Similar results were obtained using 6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-

D-MKK7 mediates the activation of D-JNK by cadmium
and arsenite
To elucidate the respective contributions of D-MKK4 and
D-MKK7 in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and
arsenite, we employed the method of RNA interference
[30,31] to "knock down" the levels of D-MKK4 and DMKK7 mRNAs either singly or in combination. Figure 4A
demonstrates that dsRNA directed against D-MKK4 and
D-MKK7 mRNAs (but not "control" dsRNA directed
against a neomycin-resistance gene not present in S2 cells)
reduced the levels of D-MKK4 and D-MKK7 mRNAs
below detection by RT-PCR. Under these conditions, the
D-MKK7 dsRNA, but not the D-MKK4 dsRNA, significantly reduced the respective abilities of cadmium and
arsenite to activate D-JNK (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 2, 5, 8,
11, and 14 for cadmium and lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 for
arsenite; Fig. 4C shows a quantification of the phosphorylation of D-JNK normalized for the levels in each lane of
D-actin). Knocking down both D-MKK4 and D-MKK7
mRNAs in combination did not result in further inhibition of the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite
(Fig. 4B, lanes 10–15). We concluded, therefore, that
MKK7 is a major mediator of the activation of D-JNK by
cadmium and arsenite.
D-MEKK1 mediates the activation of D-JNK by cadmium
and arsenite
To elucidate the roles of various JNKKK members conserved between flies and mammals, we knocked down
four JNKKK (D-ASK, D-MLK, D-MEKK1, and D-TAK),
either singly or together (see Fig. 5B for an RT-PCR detection of the respective JNKKK mRNAs under conditions of
RNAi). D-DLK was not included in the this analysis, as S2
cells have been found to be deficient in D-DLK expression
[25]. Using appropriate stimuli, we were able to demonstrate efficient desired interference with the function of
each of the chosen JNKKK. Specifically, (i) D-TAK dsRNA
blocked the activation of D-JNK by LPS (Fig. 5, lane 5), a
result consistent with the findings of Chen et al. [25]; (ii)
D-MLK dsRNA blocked the activation of D-JNK by resveratrol and ethanol (Fig. 5, lane 3 for resveratrol and not
shown for ethanol, manuscript in preparation); (iii) D-ASK
dsRNA blocked the activation of D-p38 MAP kinase by
resveratrol (Fig. 5, lane 8). Importantly, D-MEKK1 dsRNA
reduced dramatically the activation of D-JNK by both cadmium and arsenite, while not affecting the activation of

D-JNK by either resveratrol or LPS (Fig. 5, lane 4).
(Although the experiment presented in Fig. 5 appears to
demonstrate a role for D-TAK in the activation of D-JNK
by cadmium, this result was not consistently reproducible.) Knocking down all four JNKKK together reduced the
activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite more efficiently than did knocking down of D-MEKK1 alone (Fig.
5, compare lanes 4 and 6), suggesting that JNKKK other
than D-MEKK1 may contribute in a minor fashion to the
full activation of D-JNK by toxic metals. Knocking down
all four JNKKK proteins appeared to reduce the activation
of D-p38 MAPK by cadmium significantly better than
knocking down any single JNKKK (Fig. 5, lanes 7–12).
Interestingly, knocking down all four JNKKK proteins did
not reduce substantially the ability of arsenite to activate
D-p38 MAPK (Fig. 5, lanes 7–12). Furthermore, knocking
down JNKKK either singly or together did not affect the
ability of cadmium or arsenite to activate D-ERK (Fig. 5,
lanes 13–18).
Lack of apparent involvement of Rho, Ral, Rac, cdc42, and
Ras GTPases in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and
arsenite
To address the potential involvement of small GTP-binding proteins in the regulation of D-MEKK1/D-MKK7/DJNK signal transduction cascade stimulated by cadmium
and arsenite, we used dsRNA directed against D-Rho1, DRhoL, D-RalA, D-Rac1, D-Rac2, D-cdc42, and D-Ras
mRNAs. Knocking down any of these mRNAs singly had
no effect on the activation of D-JNK by either cadmium or
arsenite (not shown). We therefore undertook to knock
down all 7 GTPase mRNAs together. Figure 6A demonstrates that dsRNA directed against D-Rho1, D-RhoL, DRalA, D-Rac1, D-Rac2, D-cdc42, and D-Ras mRNAs (but
not neor dsRNA) reduced the levels of all these GTPase
mRNAs below detection by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we
could demonstrate a dramatic reduction of D-Ras protein
levels in the cells treated with dsRNA directed against DRho1, D-RhoL, D-RalA, D-Rac1, D-Rac2, D-cdc42, and DRas mRNAs (but not neor dsRNA, Fig. 6B, lanes 7–9). The
detection of D-Rho1, D-RhoL, D-RalA, D-Rac1, D-Rac2,
and D-cdc42 proteins was hampered by the lack or poor
quality of commercially available antibodies. Despite the
efficient simultaneous silencing of the seven GTPase
mRNAs (Fig. 6A), the respective abilities of cadmium or
arsenite to activate all three MAP kinases investigated were
not affected (Fig 6B, compare lanes 1–3 to 4–6 to 7–9).
Thus, the experimental evidence available cannot demonstrtate a detectable involvement of D-Rho1, D-RhoL, DRalA, D-Rac1, D-Rac2, D-cdc42, and D-Ras in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium or arsenite.

humans, we undertook a phylogeny analysis of Dro-

sophila, human, and mouse MEKKs. Our analysis identified human MEKK4/MTK1 and mouse MEKK4 to be the
closest homologues/orthologues of D-MEKK1, while the
respective human and mouse MEKK2 and MEKK3
appeared to be the furthest in divergence (Fig. 7A). In
addition to the high amino acid identity within the kinase
domains of D-MEKK1 and MEKK4/MTK1 (53% identity,
Fig. 7B), the sequence analysis revealed a substantial
degree of conservation within the N-terminal regulatory
domains of D-MEKK1 and MEKK4/MTK1 (20% identity,
Fig. 7B). On the other hand, MEKK2 and MEKK3 appear
to be furthest in divergence from D-MEKK1. It is also
interesting to note that the MEKKs display distinct rates of
divergence and selective conservation between their N-terminal regulatory domains. For instance, the N-terminal
domain of D-MEKK1 displays two identifiable protein
motifs that are present only in MEKK4/MTK1 and MEKK1:
the proline-rich motif and the pleckstrin homology
domain (Fig. 7B, [18,38]). The small GTPase-binding
motifs of mammalian MEKK1 and MEKK4/MTK1 (a Rasbinding domain in MEKK1 and a cdc42/Rac-interactive
binding motif in MEKK4/MTK1), however, are not
present in D-MEKK1 (Fig. 7B, [18,38]). This suggests that
small GTPase binding may not have been a requirement

Discussion
Investigation of toxicant-responsive signaling pathways
relevant to human health using mammalian systems is
sometimes complicated by the complex and often redundant nature of these pathways. Establishment of simpler
model systems (e.g. using organisms of lower complexity)
has proven useful in studying signaling pathways as long
as these pathways are evolutionary conserved. Toxic metals and their compounds (such as cadmium and arsenite)
are among the most ancient xenobiotic stressors affecting
all forms of life. Therefore, it is highly probable that the
cellular systems that identify and respond to toxic metals
are fairly conserved within Metazoa. The fruit fly offers
three major advantages as a model system to study cellular
stress. First, Drosophila possesses many of the stressinduced signal transduction pathways relevant to man
[25,29], the JNK pathway being one obvious example.
Second, Drosophila displays, as a rule, lesser genetic complexity and redundancy of the same signaling pathways.
For instance, the mammalian JNK family (JNK1, 2, and 3)
is represented in the fly by a single member, D-JNK. Third,
transient gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) is
technically simpler, more efficient, and more affordable
in Drosophila cells [30,31].

P-JNK (normalized for D-actin) is shown in (C). In this case,

for regulation of the ancestral MEKK by oxidative stressors
such as toxic metals and their compounds. Such a hypothesis is in agreement with the apparent lack of involvement
of D-Rho1, D-RhoL, D-RalA, D-Rac1, D-Rac2, D-cdc42,
and D-Ras in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and
arsenite in S2 cells (Fig. 6). Future mutational studies on
D-MEKK1 combined with analysis of selective conservation within the N- and C-terminal domains in its mammalian homologues would contribute to the better
understanding of the evolution of the JNK pathway signaling.

With the above rationales in mind, we undertook to identify upstream regulators of JNK that mediate the activation
of the kinase by cadmium and arsenite. The principal
novel findings we report here are that: (i) cadmium and
arsenite activate D-JNK by means of oxidative stress similar to their action in mammalian cells [28]; (ii) the action
of both cadmium and arsenite on JNK requires the
engagement of upstream kinases at the level of JNKK and
JNKKK; and (iii) D-MEKK1 is the predominant JNKKK
that appears to mediate D-JNK activation in response to
both cadmium and arsenite. We will discuss below the
possible implications of these findings to the mammalian
responses to toxic metals.
Evolutionary conservation of metal toxicity through
oxidative stress
We have reported previously that pretreatment of Rat-1
fibroblasts with NAC completely abolished the activation
of JNK by both cadmium and arsenite [28], suggesting
that oxidative stress through depletion of cellular glutathione is the modus operandi for JNK activation by these
agents in mammalian cells. The ability of NAC (Fig. 3)
and other antioxidants (such as lipoic acid and Trolox®,
not shown) to inhibit JNK activation in Drosophila S2 cells
underscores the suitability of the Drosophila model system
for heavy metal-related toxicological studies, especially in
terms of signal transduction pathways regulated by metal
toxicants.

using a mixture of dsRNAs specific for all four JNKKKs were

using primers specific for D-JNK demonstrates the lack of
non-specific interference with D-JNK mRNA.

Requirement for upstream kinases (JNKK and JNKKK) for
the activation of D-JNK by toxic metals
Over the last decade, two mechanisms have been postulated for the activation of JNK by arsenite. One mechanism suggests that active engagement, by arsenite, of
upstream kinases such as the JNKK MKK4 [28] and members of the MEKK family of JNKKK [39] is a prerequisite
for the activation of JNK by this agent. Yet Cavigelli et al.
[40] have found evidence that kinases upstream of JNK
are not activated by arsenite. The experimental data suggested rather that arsenite activated JNK by means of inactivating a JNK phosphatase, thus increasing the steadystate levels of phosphorylated JNK in arsenite-treated cells
[40]. The findings we report here lend support to the
former mechanism.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/7

In studying the regulation of JNK by cadmium, Matsuoka
et al. [41] used mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in
either MKK4 or MKK7 and concluded that both JNKKs are
required for the full activation of JNK by cadmium. However, Ding and Templeton [42] used overexpression of
dominant negative alleles of either MKK4 or MKK7 in
mesangial cells to conclude that MKK7, but not MKK4,
was responsible for the JNK activation by cadmium in
these cells. Our results clearly identify a role for hep/DMKK7 in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium (Fig. 4).
The results from the use of RNAi to knock down the
mRNA for D-MKK4 are subject, however, to more than a
single interpretation. On one hand, the results tend to
indicate the lack of apparent involvement of D-MKK4 in
the activation of D- JNK by cadmium and arsenite (Fig.
4B). However, although the levels of D-MKK4 mRNA
were brought down to levels undetectable by 30 cycles of
PCR (Fig. 4A), the unavailability of suitable antibodies for
detection of D-MKK4 precluded us from accessing the efficiency of the RNAi at the level of D-MKK4 protein. Thus,
if D-MKK4 protein has a long half-life, the remaining
amounts of D-MKK4 protein (even in the absence of available D-MKK4 mRNA) may have been sufficient to trigger
JNK activation in cadmium- or arsenite-treated S2 cells.
Further experiments are needed to clarify this point.
The need to identify the JNKKK(s) mediating the activation of JNK by cadmium and arsenite (and other oxidative
stressors in general) in the genetically-simpler Drosophila
system arises from the abundance of contradictory reports
in the literature on the regulation of mammalian JNKKK
by oxidative stress. Members of the mammalian MEKK
family have been implicated by various research groups to
mediate the activation of JNK by one or another oxidative
stressor. Using dominant-negative alleles of MEKKs, Porter et al. [39] concluded that MEKK2, 3, and 4 (but not
MEKK1) mediate the activation of JNK by arsenite. In contrast, mouse embryonic stem cell-derived from cardiac
myocytes deficient in MEKK1 displayed attenuated activation of JNK in response to H2O2, a bona fide oxidative
stressor [43]. However, in a recent report Cross & Templeton [44] described that mammalian MEKK1 is subject to
inactivation rather than activation by oxidative stressors
such as H2O2, menadione, and N-ethylmaleimide. These
researchers identified the mechanism of this inactivation,
namely the reversible glutathionylation of Cys1238 of
MEKK1 in response to oxidative stress [44]. Yet other
researchers reported that ASK1 is a mammalian JNKKK
responsive to oxidative stress [45]. In this case, the oxidation-dependent dissociation of an inhibitor of ASK1
(thioredoxin) was found to lead to the activation of ASK1,
and subsequently, of JNK [45]. In summary, it appears
that the mammalian response to oxidative stress may
involve two different mechanisms of JNK activation, one
mediated by MEKK-family member(s), and another by

dependent regulation of JNK by oxidative stressors has
emerged more recently in evolutionary history.
Based on our findings and on the available published literature, we would like to propose that the ancestral pathway of regulation of JNK by cadmium and arsenite was
dependent on the regulation of a MEKK type of JNKKK
(represented by D-MEKK1 in the fly and by the MEKK
family of kinases in mammals). In higher organisms the
regulation of JNK appears to require a more complex
modulation. This increased complexity is manifested by
the expansion of the ancestral MEKK gene into a family of
four MEKKs in mammals. Mammalian MEKK1 appears to
have also acquired a regulatory Cys1238 residue that allows
for the oxidation-triggered inactivation of this kinase [44].
Our sequence analysis of MEKKs revealed that this
cysteine residue is not present in D-MEKK1 or MEKK2, 3,
and 4 (not shown). The need for more complex regulation
of the JNK activity by oxidative stress in mammals has
resulted also in the recruitment of ASK1 as another
JNKKK. The interplay of MEKK(s) and ASK1 in mammalian cells is likely to determine the physiological outcomes (i.e. apoptosis vs. survival) of the cellular response
to oxidative stress (see also refs [44] and [46] for discussion on the topic).

dsRNA, or in the presence of 700 µg per well of dsRNA specific to neomycin resistance gene ("Neo"), or 100 µg per well
of each of dsRNAs specific to small GTP-binding proteins
from Drosophila (Rho1, RhoL, RalA, Rac1, Rac2, cdc42, and
Ras) ("All"). Four days later, cells were treated with 200 µM
CdCl2 or 200 µM NaAsO2 for 2 hours. Cell lysates were
immunoprobed with antibodies recognizing P-JNK, P-p38, PERK, and Ras (B). Expression of Rho1, RhoL, RalA, Rac1,
Rac2, cdc42, and Ras mRNAs was detected by RT-PCR using
specific primers as indicated (A). An experiment representative of 3 repetitions is shown.
ASK1. One drawback of the published reports is that a systematic parallel investigation of the roles of MEKKs and
ASK1 in the same cell type and using the same agents as
oxidative stressors has not been done. Our results identified D-MEKK1 as a major JNKKK mediating the activation
of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite (Fig. 5). Furthermore,
we did not find evidence for an involvement of D-ASK in
mediating the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite (Fig. 5). One possible implication of these results is
that the MEKK-dependent regulation of JNK by oxidative
stressors is evolutionarily more ancient, whereas the ASK-

Experimental procedures
Cell Culture
Drosophila Schneider (S2) cells (Invitrogen) were cultured
at room temperature in Drosophila serum-free medium
(DSFM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mM Lglutamine (Invitrogen) and antibiotic-antimycotic reagent (Invitrogen).
Chemicals
Cadmium chloride, sodium-m-arsenite, resveratrol, sorbitol, N-acetyl cysteine, and lipopolysacharide (LPS;
derived from E. coli 0111:B4) were from Sigma-Aldrich.
Antibodies
Phosphoepitope-specific antibodies against JNK, p38,
and ERK were from Cell Signaling Technology. These antibodies recognize the phosphorylated forms of Drosophila
MAP kinases due to the conservation of the phosphoepitopes in metazoans. The antibody against human
JNK1 (FL) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect
D-JNK. For optimal performance with Drosophila extracts,
this antibody needs to be used on naive membranes
before any other antibody hybridization. The antibody
against Ras (amino acid residues 31–43) was from Calbiochem. The epitope recognized by this antibody is completely conserved among metazoans. Drosophila actin was
detected using the JLA20 monoclonal antibody from the
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of
Iowa).

in 6-well tissue culture plates. Double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) was added and, after 1 hour of incubation, 1 ml
of Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with
10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibioticantimycotic was added. Typically, cells were used for
experiments 72 to 96 hours after the addition of dsRNA.

Cell viability
Viability studies using CellTiter-Blue™ Reagent (Promega)
were performed according to manufacturer's protocol.
RNA interference (RNAi) in S2 cells
RNAi was performed according to Dixon laboratory's protocol [31]. S2 cells (3 × 106) were plated in 1 ml of DSFM

RNA isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 S2 cells using TRIZOL® Reagent (Invitrogen) and according to manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from
total RNA using Superscript First-strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen). The same primers were used for cDNA synthesis and for detecting mRNA levels by RT-PCR. The
sequences of all primers (except for the primers for neoR,
see below) were exactly as described by Chen et al. [25]
and contained a 5' T7 RNA polymerase-binding site. As a
negative control for specificity of RNAi, we designed primers for a neomycin-resistance gene (neoR, not present in S2
cells), also with 5' T7 RNA polymerase-binding sites (forward primer: 5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCATTGAACAAGATGGATTGCACG-3', reverse primer: 5'TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGATGTTTCGCTTGGTGGTCG-3'). pcDNA3 plasmid was used as a template for
the neoR gene amplification. The following PCR program
was used: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of amplification (95°C for 1 min,
55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min) and an additional
10 min at 72°C. PCR products were cloned using TA
Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced for confirmation.
Generation of dsRNA for RNAi
Clones with confirmed correct sequences were used as
templates for PCR. PCR products (ranging from ~500 to
~700 bp) served as templates for MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) to make single stranded RNA (ssRNA).
SsRNA products were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in RNase-free water. SsRNAs were annealed by
heating to 65°C for 30 min and then slowly cooling to
room temperature to produce dsRNA. DsRNA concentration was measured by absorbance at λ260 nm and dsRNA
samples were visualized on 1% agarose gel. DsRNAs were
stored at -20°C.
Preparation of cell lysates and immunoblot analyses
To avoid potential post-lysis modifications or degradation
of proteins of interest, the cells were harvested by direct
lysis in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample-loading buffer, followed by
heat denaturation at 95°C for 5 min and ultrasonic shearing. The electrophoretic separation of proteins in SDSPAGE and electrotransfer onto PVDF membrane (Millipore) were performed using standard procedures. Immunoprobing with specific antibodies and enhanced
chemiluminescent detection (DuPont NEN Research

the respective manufacturers. For immunoblot quantification, appropriately nonsaturated film exposures were
selected and scanned, and the scanned images were
imported into IP Lab Gel (Molecular Dynamics) software
for quantification.
