Abstract
Background: Comparative genomics has become an essential approach for identifying
homologous gene candidates and their functions, and for studying genome evolution. There are
many tools available for genome comparisons. Unfortunately, most of them are not applicable for
the identification of unique genes and the inference of phylogenetic relationships in a given set of
genomes.
Results: GenomeBlast is a Web tool developed for comparative analysis of multiple small
genomes. A new parameter called "coverage" was introduced and used along with sequence
identity to evaluate global similarity between genes. With GenomeBlast, the following results can
be obtained: (1) unique genes in each genome; (2) homologous gene candidates among compared
genomes; (3) 2D plots of homologous gene candidates along the all pairwise genome comparisons;
and (4) a table of gene presence/absence information and a genome phylogeny. We demonstrated
the functions in GenomeBlast with an example of multiple herpesviral genome analysis and
illustrated how GenomeBlast is useful for small genome comparison.
Conclusion: We developed a Web tool for comparative analysis of small genomes, which allows
the user not only to identify unique genes and homologous gene candidates among multiple
genomes, but also to view their graphical distributions on genomes, and to reconstruct genome
phylogeny. GenomeBlast runs on a Linux server with 4 CPUs and 4 GB memory. The online version
of GenomeBlast is available to public by using a Web browser with the URL http://bioinfosrv1.awh.unomaha.edu/genomeblast/.

Background
With the rapidly increasing availability of complete
genome sequences, genome-wide sequence comparison
has become an essential approach for finding homologous gene candidates, for identifying gene functions, and
for studying genome evolution [1,2]. Genome comparison can be used to find genes that characterize unique features in a given organism such as specific phenotypic
variation or particular pathogenicity [3]. Meanwhile,
genome phylogenies based on gene content or gene order
shed new light on the construction of the Tree of Life
[4,5].
Currently many tools such as MUMmer and Artemis are
available for comparative genomic analysis [2,6-8]. These
tools can be used for pairwise genome alignment (e.g.,
[3,9,10]) as well as multiple genome alignment e.g.,
[11,12]). Unfortunately, most of them are not applicable
for the identification of unique genes in a given set of
genomes, since the tools were developed for homologous
gene detection in most cases. Additionally, only a few
tools can be used for the study of phylogeny from the
genomic point of view [13].
The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm
as well as other anchor-based algorithms are commonly
used for the identification of homologous gene candidates across diverse genomes [2,14]. Although the BLAST
algorithm has its pros such as fast computation and accurate results in detecting local highly-similar sequences
regions, it sustains two cons when used to identify global
sequence similarity: (1) genes that reside in local highlysimilar regions can be erroneously identified as homologue candidates; and (2) multiple local hits that happen
against the same subjective sequence need to be combined to obtain the overall aligned region between the
query and subject sequences.
In order to solve these problems, we developed a Web
tool, GenomeBlast. It performs multiple genome comparisons, identifies unique genes as well as shared (possibly
homologous) genes among the genomes, and reconstructs the genome phylogeny. Identification of homologous gene candidates is done by detecting global sequence
similarity using alignment coverage information. This
paper describes its architecture, algorithms, and implementation. We demonstrate the practical use of GenomeBlast with an example using herpesviral genomes, and
discuss its future improvement plan.

Implementation
Architecture
The architecture of GenomeBlast is illustrated in Figure 1.
In addition to input and output modules, it consists of
sequence extraction, database formatting, sequence com-

parison, output filtering, and visual presentation of
results.
The inputs to GenomeBlast are genome sequences in the
GenBank format, each in a single file. Each genome
sequence record needs to include the FEATURE table with
coding sequence (CDS) annotations. Such data can be
downloaded from public databases such as the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)[15]. Protein sequences are extracted from translation records in
the CDS annotations. The formatdb program is used to
generate protein database files from the protein dataset
for each genome. These protein database files can be used
with the blastp program. The all-against-all blasting strategy is used for genome comparison. Each of the protein
sequences from one genome is compared against protein
sequences from all other genomes. The BLAST results are
then filtered and presented in various outputs.
Three-level outputs generated from GenomeBlast include:
(1) candidates for unique genes and homologous genes;
(2) 2D plots of homologous gene candidates for pairwise
genome comparisons; (3) a table of gene presence/
absence information; (4) genome phylogeny; and (5) a
summary table for multiple genome comparison.
Algorithm
Coverage calculation
We used the blastp algorithm for protein sequence comparison. Since the BLAST search may result in identifying
only short local similarities (short local similarities can be
obtained from any conserved domains/regions even if the
sequences are not derived from homologous genes) or in
identifying multiple short similarities from the same CDS
(Figure 2), we introduced a parameter called "coverage" to
detect gene-wide sequence similarity. The percent alignment coverage (c) is calculated using the following equation:
k −1 k
⎛ k
c = ⎜ (∑ Li − ∑ ∑ Li , j ) Lquery
⎜ i =1
i =1 j =i +1
⎝

⎞
⎟ × 100%
⎟
⎠

(1)

where Li, Li,j, and Lquery represent the alignment length for
the ith hit, the overlap length between the hits i and j, and
the query length, respectively; and k is the total number of
hits to the same subject sequence for a given query
sequence.
Identification of homologous gene candidates
In order to identify homologous gene candidates and to
exclude related genes that share similarities only with limited regions, GenomeBlast can use a combination of following thresholds:

Figure 1
The architecture of GenomeBlast
The architecture of GenomeBlast. GenomeBlast consists of sequence extraction, database formatting, sequence comparison, output filtering, and visual presentation of results. The inputs to GenomeBlast are genome sequences in the GenBank format, each in a single file. The outputs include three-level results: 1) putative unique genes and homologous genes; 2) 2D plots
of homologous gene candidates for pairwise genome comparisons; 3) a table of gene presence/absence information, genome
phylogeny, and a summary table for multiple genome comparison.

i) Coverage. The coverage is the length of aligned regions
calculated as above. The default threshold is 50%.
ii) Identity. The identity is the proportion (%) of identical
amino acid pairs in the aligned region. The default threshold is 30%.
iii) E-value. The E-value, expectation value, is the number
of different alignments with scores equivalent to or better
than the scores that are expected to occur in a database
search by chance. The default threshold is 10. In the
default setting, GenomeBlast uses only the coverage and
identity, but not the E-value threshold.
Genome phylogeny reconstruction
Based on the results of multiple genome comparison, the
presence and absence of each CDS is tabulated with 1s
(for presence) and 0s (for absence) for each genome.
Using this binary character matrix, the maximum parsimony method [16] with the branch-and-bound tree
search algorithm is used to infer genome phylogeny. The
branch-and-bound algorithm effectively searches the possible tree topologies and guarantees finding the most parsimonious phylogeny [17].

Backend programs and the Web server
The blastp program in the BLAST stand-alone package
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/ was used for protein
sequence comparison. The PENNY program of the
PHYLIP package implements the maximum parsimony
phylogenetic method using the branch-and-bound tree
search algorithm and a binary character data matrix [18].
The data processing/analysis and integration of the blastp
and PENNY programs into GenomeBlast were implemented with the PERL programming language. The Web
applications were developed using PHP. GenomeBlast
runs on a Linux server, which has four processors (2.0
GHz each), 4 GB memory, and 400 GB disk space.

Results
We will use thirteen herpesviral genomes described in [4]
as an example, and go through GenomeBlast step by step
to demonstrate its functions (Figure 1).
The first step is to set up blastp options. We did not
choose the filter option to mask off low compositional
complexity or mask for the lookup table. We used the
default values provided in GenomeBlast (E-value: 10,

and the subject sequence.
word size: 3, gap existence cost: 11, gap extension cost: 1,
and scoring matrix: BLOSUM62).
The next step is to upload genome sequence files. We set
up the number of genomes to compare as 13 and clicked
the OK button. We then uploaded the 13 herpesviral
genome sequence files, which were originally downloaded from NCBI in the GenBank format. The average
size of these genomes was approximately 150 kb. Formatting databases and performing all-against-all blastp comparison took 5 minutes 16 seconds on our server.
The third step is to set up parameters for gene comparisons. We used the default threshold values, i.e., 50% coverage and 30% identity for determining homologous
CDS. The last step is to view genome comparison results
at three different levels, i.e., single-genome, pairwisegenome, and multiple-genome levels. We chose two alpha
viruses, EBV and EHV2, to show functions available for
the single-genome level analysis. Note that any number of
genome combinations can be used for unique gene or
homologous gene candidate identification. A total of 45
and 38 unique gene candidates were found respectively in
EBV and EHV (Figure 3), whereas 82 homologous CDS
candidates were identified between these two genomes
(Figure 4).
For the pairwise-genome comparisons, any two genomes
can be chosen and a 2D plot of distribution of homologous gene candidates is generated. We clicked the hyperlink EBV.gb-EHV2.gb (alternatively, we can choose from
the drop-down menu) and a 2D plot was displayed in a

new window as shown in Figure 5. Interestingly, the plot
suggests that genomic inversion might have occurred
between these two viruses. Clicking each dot in the plot,
we can see its corresponding information including the
query name, subject name, and % identity. Of the 82
homologous CDS candidates, only two proteins were
found to have sequence identities higher than 80%
(colored in red), 20 proteins had identities between 50%
and 80% (colored in pink), and the rest had identities
between 30% and 50% (colored in yellow).
At the multiple-genome level, we can obtain the binary
gene presence/absence table (not shown) and the genome
phylogeny as shown in Figure 6A. The phylogeny indicates that there are three virus groups, which is more
clearly shown in the phylogeny redrawn with the
TreeView program [19] (Figure 6B). This result showing
three groups of herpesviruses is consistent with previous
reports [1,4].

Discussion
GenomeBlast has several unique features compared with
other comparative genomics tools [2,3,9-12,20,21].
Instead of focusing on generating alignments, GenomeBlast identifies unique and shared, possibly homologous,
CDS sets among multiple genomes and presents the information in a summary table. It generates 2D plots depicting the distribution of homologous CDS between given
pairs of genomes. In order to identify possible homologous CDS, GenomeBlast uses the blastp sequence similarity search program. Combining the length of alignment
coverage with % identity of the aligned region, it evaluates

gene-wide similarity. This combination of coverage and
identity can better identify homologous CDS candidates.
GenomeBlast also provides flexibility in choosing different combinations of parameters and their threshold values. Once the blast search is done, there is no need for
redoing the blast search and the user can return to the
parameter-setting page to reset thresholds for identifying
homologous gene candidates.
GenomeBlast reconstructs genome phylogeny based on
gene content using the maximum parsimony method. In
this context, GenomeBlast overlap with the Web server,
SHOT [13]. SHOT also includes a gene-order phylogeny
method. Whereas SHOT can be used for only a certain set
of genomes, GenomeBlast offers more flexibility.

Montague and Hutchison [4] reconstructed wholegenome phylogenies for 13 herpesviral genomes based on
the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) data [22].
They used several computer programs/packages before
reconstructing the genome phylogenies including the
Wisconsin Package (GCG) [23], BLAST programs, and
PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony) [24]. We
performed the same analysis using GenomeBlast alone
and our genome phylogeny agreed with their result [4]. It
demonstrates that GenomeBlast is a very useful application for small genome comparison. Our plan to extend
functions in GenomeBlast includes automatic CDS extraction/translation, use of FASTA sequence format, DNAlevel analysis using blastn, and gene-order based genome
phylogeny.

GenomeBlast is suitable for small genome comparison.
We do not expect it to compare large genomes, such as
human and mouse genomes, because such computation
with large genomes is extremely expensive, which will
take several days or even weeks to complete. For larger
genomes, standalone programs such as MUMmer and
Artemis can be used. Or for the model organisms, some

homologous gene databases such as HomoloGene [25]
and Inparanoid are available for use [26-28].

Conclusion
We have developed a Web tool for comparative analysis of
small genomes. With GenomeBlast, we can identify
unique genes and homologous gene candidates among
multiple genomes, view their graphical distributions on
