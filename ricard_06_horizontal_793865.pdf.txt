Abstract
Background: The horizontal transfer of expressed genes from Bacteria into Ciliates which live in
close contact with each other in the rumen (the foregut of ruminants) was studied using ciliate
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). More than 4000 ESTs were sequenced from representatives of
the two major groups of rumen Cilates: the order Entodiniomorphida (Entodinium simplex,
Entodinium caudatum, Eudiplodinium maggii, Metadinium medium, Diploplastron affine, Polyplastron
multivesiculatum and Epidinium ecaudatum) and the order Vestibuliferida, previously called
Holotricha (Isotricha prostoma, Isotricha intestinalis and Dasytricha ruminantium).
Results: A comparison of the sequences with the completely sequenced genomes of Eukaryotes
and Prokaryotes, followed by large-scale construction and analysis of phylogenies, identified 148
ciliate genes that specifically cluster with genes from the Bacteria and Archaea. The phylogenetic
clustering with bacterial genes, coupled with the absence of close relatives of these genes in the
Ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, indicates that they have been acquired via Horizontal Gene
Transfer (HGT) after the colonization of the gut by the rumen Ciliates.
Conclusion: Among the HGT candidates, we found an over-representation (>75%) of genes
involved in metabolism, specifically in the catabolism of complex carbohydrates, a rich food source

in the rumen. We propose that the acquisition of these genes has greatly facilitated the Ciliates'
colonization of the rumen providing evidence for the role of HGT in the adaptation to new niches.

Background
Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) implicates the transfer of
genetic material between species. Genes acquired by this
process can provide novel functions to the recipient
organism, particularly when that organism is naive for
functions associated with the newly acquired gene(s).
Therefore, HGT has the potential to play an important
role in the exploitation of new niches. HGT has been
inferred in many biological processes including the emergence and spread of virulence-factors, resistance to antibiotics, and the long-term maintenance of organelles [1].
Thus far, HGT on a large-scale has mainly been described
from organelles to the nucleus transfer [2], and between
different species of Bacteria and Archaea [3,4], and on a
smaller scale from Eukaryotes to Bacteria [5]. The least
well-documented form of large-scale HGT deals with the
uptake of DNA into eukaryotic cells. Individual examples
include transfer from Bacteria to Fungi [6] or Ciliates [7]
in the rumen. The transfer of 16 bacterial genes to Nematodes [8] and of 96 such genes to Entamoeba histolytica [9]
are the only examples where HGT from Bacteria to
Eukaryotes has been investigated on a large-scale.
Here we investigate HGT from the Bacteria to rumen Ciliates – a monophyletic but rather diverse group of unicellular Eukaryotes. These organisms co-exist in the rumen
under conditions that have been shown to allow HGT in
vitro [10,11]. Ciliates form an extremely diverse taxonomic group of protozoa with an enormous diversity of
known species. They are the most complex single cell
Eukaryotes, some having genomes with more than 30,000
genes [12]. They are abundant in almost every aqueous
environment, from ocean waters to small ponds and even
pockets of soil water; and they can grow as symbionts,
commensals or parasites in pelagic, benthic, sapropelic or
intestinal ecosystems. One of the intestinal environments
in which Ciliates have been described is the rumen, a
highly specialized foregut differentiation in herbivorous
mammals like cattle, sheep and goats. In these animals
the rumen is the primary site for digestion of plant material consumed as a food source. Digestion is performed by
a numerous and diverse microbiota including Bacteria,
anaerobic Fungi, and Ciliates. The resulting fermentation
products, such as short-chain fatty acids, but also the
microbial biomass substantially contribute to the nutrition of the host. There is a certain degree of genomic plasticity within this environment, with some evidence for
HGT between organisms [6] and one bacterial species
being naturally transformable [11].

Given the close contact between Ciliates and Bacteria in
the rumen, this environment promises optimal conditions to study HGT from Bacteria to Eukaryotes, in particular, because Ciliates engulf and digest Bacteria [13]. In
the process of breakdown and digestion of the Bacteria,
some of the bacterial DNA may be taken up by the Ciliates
and incorporated into their genomes.
Thus far, there have been reports of HGT to the rumen Ciliates of a xylanase [7], a cellulase [14] and a glutamate
dehydrogenase [15]. Whether these are incidental occurrences or whether there is indeed evidence for large-scale
HGT from Bacteria to Ciliates within this environment
remained to be discovered. Here we have undertaken random cDNA sequencing of rumen dwelling Ciliates in
order to identify expressed HGT candidates. As part of the
EU-funded programs ERCULE (European Rumen ciliates
CULturE collection), and CIMES (CIliates as Monitors for
the Environmental Safety of GMOs) cDNA libraries were
constructed from ten species of rumen Ciliates and were
sequenced randomly (these ciliates were cultivated as
mono-cultures in fistulated sheep). Thus we have
obtained a large set of cDNAs (4768 sequences) from Ciliates belonging to the order Entodiniomorphida: i.e. Entodinium simplex, Entodinium caudatum, Eudiplodinium
maggii, Metadinium medium, Diploplastron affine, Polyplastron multivesiculatum and Epidinium ecaudatum and from
Isotricha prostoma, Isotricha intestinalis and Dasytricha ruminantium, which belong to the order Vestibuliferida. Here
we examine these EST data for HGT from Bacteria. Using
large-scale sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses we find 148 genes that are likely to have been horizontally transferred to the Ciliates. The majority of these
genes are involved in the catabolism of complex carbohydrates and in the adaptation to an anaerobic environment. This supports the hypothesis that HGT plays an
important role in the exploitation of new niches.

Results
Best Hit within the Bacteria
A total of 4768 sequences were generated. Following filtering of sequences (see methods section) we clustered the
remaining 4324 ESTs to remove redundancy. Grouping
sequences with >97% identity over a stretch of at least 100
nucleotides resulted in 377 clusters containing between
two and 21 sequences, and 3186 single sequence clusters
(More details in Table 1). In order to find potential cases
of HGT, we first performed a Best Hit search (translated
nucleotides versus protein) against the predicted proteomes of 148 completely sequenced genomes. Examin-

ing the longest sequence per cluster resulted in 2307
clusters out of 3563 (64.75%) with a Best Hit in one of the
complete genomes. The species distribution of the Best
Hits (Figure 1), ranging from Plasmodium falciparum with
the most hits, followed by Arabidopsis thaliana and Danio
rerio is in agreement with the phylogeny of the Eukaryotes
proposed by Baldauf et al. [16]. According to that phylogeny the sub-class Ciliophora is most closely related to the
Apicomplexa (P. falciparum), then to the Viridiplantae (A.
thaliana) and then to the Opisthokonts (D. rerio, Homosapiens, Neurosporacrassa).
Of the 38 Best Hit proteomes shown in Figure 1, the top
12 proteomes are eukaryotic. Nevertheless, we also found
a substantial number of ESTs with a bacterial Best Hit. The
Bacterium with the most Best Hits is Clostridiumacetobutylicum, a Firmicute which has previously been isolated from
bovine rumen fluid [17]. A total of 11 different Firmicutes
were identified with Best Hits, plus nine "other" Bacteria
and two Archaea species.
Firmicutes, as with other "intestinal" Bacteria are likely
HGT donors because they live in close contact with the
studied Ciliates in the gastrointestinal tract of the ruminants [18]. According to Edwards et al., low G+C Gram
positive Bacteria represent 54% of the rumen bacterial
ecosystem, followed by the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group (40%) [19]. Nelson et al. (2003) also show
that Gram negative Bacteria were poorly represented in
the gastrointestinal tract of wild herbivores [20].
A Best Hit approach can only provide an indication of the
relationship between sequences in different organisms,
and it does not always reflect the closest neighbour [21].
Therefore, we used a phylogenetic approach to further

analyse those ciliate sequences which have a Best Hit in
the bacterial genomes.
Furthermore we show details of the complete SWX comparison against the 148 proteomes in Additional file 2.
Among 292 sequences with a Best Hit in Bacteria, 138
(47%) only hit Bacteria and this number raise to 151
(52%) that hit both Bacteria and Archaea.
Phylogenetic analysis
Of the 362 sequences that have a bacterial sequence as
Best Hit, 224 had enough homologs (minimally three) to
construct phylogenetic trees (see Methods). In 133 of
these 224 trees, the ciliate sequence clusters within the
Bacteria (in these trees the second-smallest partition of the
tree that contains the ciliate sequence and otherwise only
contains Bacterial sequences, see Methods). Further examination of these 133 trees shows that in 34 trees the ciliate
sequence clusters within Firmicutes, in nine trees within
Proteobacteria, in three trees within Actinobacteria, in
three trees within Bacteroidetes and in one tree within Spirochetes. In the remaining 83 trees the ciliate sequence
clustered within a taxonomically more varied set of Bacteria. We also considered 13 ciliate sequences that clustered
between the Bacteria and Archaea as HGT candidates, as
well as two that clustered within the Archaea. Thus a total
of 148 sequences were studied in more detail. We
included all trees that showed evidence of HGT, irrespective of their statistical support, because we are interested
in an estimate of the amount of HGT. The dominance of
one functional class among the HGT candidates (see
below) indicates the robustness of our results.

No bias of codon usage was detected, indicating complete
adaptation to the codon usage of the Ciliate host and con-

firming that the HGT candidates are not contaminations
(data not shown).
Over-representation of genes involved in anaerobic
metabolism among HGT candidates
Out of 3563 clusters in our database, 2280 were assigned
to at least one KOG or COG. Among the HGT candidates
there is an over representation of genes involved in metabolism: while in the complete EST dataset the functions
involved in Cellular process and signalling (47.0%) are

prevalent, most of the HGT candidates are involved in
Metabolism (75.4%) (See Figure 2).(Note that this
number is an underestimate as it does not include 15 of
the 30 sequences which do not belong to a KOG/COG –
among which are eight xylanases, two cellulases, three
pectate lyases, one uridine kinase and one α-glucosidase).
Comparing the numbers of ESTs per cluster we found no
indication that horizontally transferred genes are higher
expressed than non-transferred ones (data not shown).

enzymes (~84%), more than 35% of them are glycosyl
hydrolases (GH), enzymes that are involved in the degradation of carbohydrates from the plant cell wall.
More specifically, most of the horizontally transferred
enzymes are involved in the catabolism rather than in the
anabolism. A description of these 148 candidates can be
found in Additional file 2. Notably, we find a spectrum of
enzymes in the Entodiniomorphids that is very different
from that we find in the Vestibuliferids. The Vestibuliferids expressed some enolases, fructokinases, glucokinases that we did not find in the Entodiniomorphids. In
contrast, the Entodiniomorphids expressed enzymes such
as cellobiose phosphorylases, cellulases, xylanases, pec-

tate lyase, aspartate-ammonia lyase and nitroreductase
that were not found in the Vestibuliferid sequences. Moreover the only GHs that were found in the Vestibuliferids
(lysozyme, β-hexoaminidase, 6-phospho β-glucosidase)
are not fibrolytic enzymes. This matches the observation
of Williams and Coleman (1992) that Vestibuliferids do
not ingest fibres. These Ciliates depend on the uptake of
starch and Bacteria.
Glycosyl hydrolases (GH) and other enzymes involved in
the degradation of complex carbohydrates
The HGT candidates are dominated by the presence of one
class of enzymes, namely the glycosyl hydrolases. These
are a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyse the gly-

cosidic bonds between carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. Below, we
described these enzymes, and more specifically the xylanases and cellulases.
We found twelve xylanases within the 148 HGT candidates. All of them are restricted to the Entodiniomorphids
[P. multivesiculatum (2), Epi. ecaudatum (3), Eud. maggii
(2), Dip. affine (1) and M. medium (4)]. Five of them are
homologous to three genes of C. acetobutylicum (possible

xylan degradation enzymes Q97TI1, Q97TI3 and
Q97TI6) that are located in a single operon indicating that
there might have been only a single transfer event involving a piece of DNA containing the whole operon. In this
case, we may expect that the other homologues of the
xylanase genes that were located on the same operon in C.
acetobutylicum but that were not present in our set, are
present in M. medium, P. multivesiculatum and E. maggii
genomes. On the other hand, without complete genome
data, we cannot exclude gene loss either. Table 2 describes

domains present in these xylanases genes found in Ciliates, and the domains found in the other glycosyl hydrolases.
The set of HGT candidates also contains nine cellulases,
which were only found in the Entodiniomorphids (Epi.
ecaudatum (7) and P. multivesiculatum (2)). Seven of
them belong to GH family 5 and only contain a cellulase
domain. AM053298 belongs to GH family 9 and contains
a glycol_hydro_9 domain. AM055058 contains an endoglucanase E like domain. Some cellulolytic Bacteria and
rumen Fungi have cellulosome, which is a multi-enzyme
complex for the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides [22]. This cellulosome consists of a scaffoldin protein that binds several glycosyl hydrolases via specialized
intermodular "cohesin-dockerin" interactions. Finding
such protein could reinforce the prokaryotic origin of the
cellulases. However, we found no evidence for the presence of a scaffoldin and any cohesin domain was detected
in the ciliate sequences. This could be explained by the
fact that the occurrence of cellulases was restricted to
those species that are able to ingest plant fibres. Therefore,
it is likely that these cellulases do not require cohesin
domains as is the case in bacterial or fungal cellulases,
which are excreted into the environment. Our results on
expressed genes are consistent with previous work on
enzyme activities. We found cellulases in Epidinium confirming previous work using recombinant DNA technology [14], in which an Epidinium cellulase was shown to be
functional. Furthermore, the role of P. multivesiculatum in
cellulose digestion [23] is consistent with the presence of
a cellulase in our Polyplastron sequences. Conversely, the
absence of cellulase genes among the ESTs of Entodinium,
is consistent with in vitro studies of Entodinium in which
no cellulase activity was detected [24,25].
Beside the xylanases and cellulases mentioned above, we
also found other enzymes involved in the degradation of
the complex carbohydrates: an α-glucanotransferase, a βhexosaminidase, a 6-phospho-β-glucosidase, three pectate lyases, a pectin degradation protein, four cellobiose
phosphorylases, two glycosidases, an α-xylosidase, an αglucosidase, a chitinase, a lysozyme, a polygalacturonase,
a carbohydrate esterase, a sorbitol dehydrogenase and a
galactoside O-acetyltransferase, two fructokinases, an
aldose epimerase precusrsor.
Adaptation to an anaerobic environment
Among the other HGT candidates are an Fe-hydrogenase
and a malic enzyme, which are of interest because of their
link with hydrogenosomes, membrane-bound organelles
present in a number of anaerobic organisms such as the
ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis [26], the chytrid fungi Neocallimastix and Piromyces, and the Parabasalian flagellate Trichomonas vaginalis. Most hydrogenases are found in such

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/22

membrane-bound organelles, but there are exceptions for
example in Giardia and Entamoeba where hydrogenases
are located in the cytoplasm [27,28]. Similarly, also malic
enzymes are found in various compartments of the
eukaryotic cell: in Trichomonas vaginalis, a cytosolic malic
enzyme of bacterial origin was found as well as a hydrogenosomal homologue [29]. Until now hydrogenosomes
of rumen ciliates have not been studied in more detail,
and it remains unclear as to whether all rumen Ciliates
possess hydrogenosomes [30].
Another enzyme, Pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1phosphotransferase (EC: 2.7.1.90) can also be linked to
adaptation to an anaerobic environment. This enzyme
catalyzes the phosphorylation of D-fructose 6-phosphate
to D-fructose 1,6 biphosphate, using PPi rather than the
standard 6-phosphofructokinase (EC: 2.7.1.11) which
uses ATP. PPi dependent phosphofructokinase typically
occurs, besides in plants, among anaerobic unicellular
species, and has been suggested to be an adaptation to a
situation where the glycolysis is the sole source of ATP
[31-33].
In the HGT candidates we also found some enzymes
involved in nitrogen metabolism: four nitroreductases,
two aspartate-ammonia ligases (EC: 6.3.1.1), an aspartate-ammonia lyase (4.3.1.1) and a NAD specific glutamate dehydrogenase (EC: 1.4.1.3). These last three
enzymes catalyse the reversible reactions between ammonia and the respective amino-acids: L-Asparagine, LAspartate and L-Glutamate. In the rumen, the proteins are
degraded into amino-acids, which are then rapidly deaminated to form ammonia. Ammonia can then be excreted
via urine and faeces or, alternatively assimilated by ruminal Bacteria [34] or by the Ciliates themselves. Indeed a
glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) probably acquired
through HGT, has already been described in Entodinium
caudatum. This GDH was cloned and expressed in E. coli,
where it expressed a high affinity for ammonia and αketoglutarate and a low affinity for glutamate, suggesting
that the enzyme may be involved in the assimilation of
ammonia by Ent. caudatum in the rumen [15].

Discussion
Detecting HGT by a phylogenetic approach after selecting
candidates by Best Hit
A number of methods have been proposed to detect horizontal gene transfer, varying from Best Hit approaches
[35] to phylogenetic methods [36] and methods that
examine aberrant codon usage [37]. Here we have combined a fast screening "Best Hit" method for the detection
of potential candidates followed by two levels of phylogenetic analyses. First, we used the Best Hit method to
restrict the data set of potential candidates. Then, the fast
Neighbor-Joining method highlighted the sequences that

clustered within the Bacteria. In the final step we used a
Maximum Likelihood approach which is the more time
consuming, but also a more reliable phylogenetic
method. Such a multi-step approach appears well suited
for the detection of likely candidates when doing Maximum Likelihood analyses for all genes would be too time
consuming. The large number of phylogenetic trees that
had to be examined prompted us to use an automated
method for their analysis: the examination of the species
composition of the second smallest partition, allowing us
to pinpoint the Firmicutes as the largest group of potential
donors of genes.
Our large-scale analysis allowed us nevertheless to identify the few genes previously shown from small scale analyses, to have arisen through HGT (cellulase [14], xylanase
[7,15]), thereby confirming the usefulness and validity of
our method.
HGT frequency
HGT seems to be an important process in the evolution of
rumen Ciliates. In total 4.1% of the ESTs available for
these ciliates appear to have been acquired by HGT. This
number is at least one order of magnitude higher than the
level of HGT found in (plant-pathogenic) nematodes (16
in the whole genome, i.e. 16 in roughly 19,000 genes, less
than 0.1%) [8] and about four times the 1% of potential
HGT's found in (the parasite) Entamoeba histolytica [9],
although these differences might be biased due to the
usage of EST data instead of DNA based gene predictions.
However, even under the (unrealistic) assumption that
the 148 candidates genes for HGT in rumen ciliates
described here represent the vast majority of all HGT
genes in the genome of a "standard" rumen ciliate with
more than 30,000 genes, the incidence of HGT would still
be about 0.5%.

The low number of transfers in nematodes (and multicellular eukaryotes in general) might be due to the fact the
transferred genes must be incorporated into the germ line
to be inherited. This hampers, for principal reasons, HGT
into the genome of multicellular organisms. In contrast,
Entamoeba histolytica, which exhibits a genome-wide HGT
incidence of about 1%, is a unicellular eukaryote without
any germ-line soma differentiation. Ciliates are in an
intermediate position between unicellular organisms and
multicellular organisms, being unicellular organisms, but
possessing a differentiated germ-line (the micronucleus),
and a somatic nucleus (the macronucleus), which
accounts for all transcriptional activities during the vegetative growth of the cell. Therefore, the high incidence of
evolutionary HGT might be surprising in the first
instance. However, the unusually high incidence of HGT
in ciliates can be explained by (i) their bacteriovory,
which eventually leads to the release of bacterial DNA into

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/22

the cytoplasm, and (ii) their nuclear dimorphism, which
allows amplification of foreign DNA in the macronucleus
[38]. Furthermore, Ciliates possess a sophisticated
machinery of enzymes facilitating extended genome reorganizations obviously allowing the assembly of DNA into
novel genetic environments [39].
The level of HGT in Ciliates seems more comparable to
that observed in Bacteria (~10%) [37]. Most of the studies
about HGT within Bacteria are based on the nucleotide
composition as it has been postulated that transferred
genes retain the nucleotide composition of the donor for
some time [40]. This is however a relatively poor indicator[41], particularly in the case of genes which have been
incorporated long ago.
Adaptive value of HGT in exploitation of new niches
The vast majority of the transferred genes that we found in
this study are involved in the degradation of plant cell
wall derived carbohydrates, indicating an adaptation to
the carbohydrate-rich environment in which these Ciliates live.

Interestingly, also the few other examples of HGT from
Bacteria to Eukaryotes tend to involve complex carbohydrate degradation enzymes. Previously documented
examples include an endo-1,4-mannanase (a glycosyl
hydrolase) in Piromyces [42], a β-1,4-endoglucanase (cellulase) [8,43], an endoglucanase and probably other glycoside hydrolases in Orpinomyces, a rumen fungus [6] and
pectinases in the Nematodes [8]. Here we have shown that
carbohydrate degrading enzymes also dominate in a large
set of horizontally transferred genes. In contrast, in the
analysis of horizontal gene transfer between e.g. Archaea
and Bacteria, the transferred functions are not specifically
involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates
although there is a dominance of "operational" proteins
over "informational" proteins [44]. The HGT candidates
we found are mainly encoding proteins involved in the
degradation of complex plant cell wall derived carbohydrates reinforcing the interpretation that genes were only
retained that provide an evolutionary advantage for the
host in the particular ecological niche. Thus, we were able
to substantiate our postulate that the lifestyle of ciliates in
the gastro-intestinal tract of animals and their unique
genome organisation, i.e. the presence of a macronucleus
with highly processed, gene-dense chromosomes,
together with a germ-line nucleus that tolerates large
genome rearrangements [39], would provide favourable
circumstances for the acquisition of foreign DNA. The
observed high rate of HGT makes rumen Ciliates ideal
bio-monitors for identification of potential gene transfer
events in the gastro-intestinal tract of farm animals. The
frequency of the historical transfers observed here
approaches the levels of bacterial HGTs. As Ciliates ingest

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:22

Bacteria, it also supports the "You are what you eat"
hypothesis, since the sources for the historical HGT were
clearly Bacteria which are related to Bacteria which are
abundant in the rumen and gut of herbivorous mammals.

Conclusion
We have screened a large set of ESTs from Rumen Ciliates,
Eukaryotes that live in the foregut of the ruminant, by
combining two methods: Best Hit and phylogenetic analyses. The amount of HGT (4.1%) is larger than what has
ever been described in Eukaryotes. The results are consistent in the sense that the Horizontal Transfers are dominated by genes that internally encode enzymes involved
into a few, specialized metabolic processes. Rumen Ciliate
species live an anaerobic enviroment that is characterized
by the availability of a rich source of plant polymers. Since
Ciliates per se (c.f. the Tetrahymena genome) seem to possess only a limited repertoire of enzymes allowing the
catabolism of such carbohydrates, a substantial fraction of
the genes involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates in
the rumen Ciliates appears to be acquired from Firmicutes
and other Bacteria, which are well represented in the
rumen.
Thus the horizontally transferred genes identified in this
research may have greatly facilitated the Ciliates' colonization of their rumen habitat.

Methods
Construction of a cDNA library and sequencing
cDNA libraries were constructed from the Ciliates Ent.
simplex, Ent. caudatum, Eud. maggii, M. medium, Dip. affine,
P. multivesiculatum and Epi. ecaudatum (all Entodiniomorphids) and the Vestibuliferids I. prostoma, I. intestinalis and
Das. ruminantium as described previously [45] and cloned
into λ-Zap (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's
instructions. Randomly picked clones were selected from
P. multivesiculatum (721), Epid. ecaudatum (681), Eud.
maggii (638), Ent. caudatum (1207), I. prostoma (638), and
Das. ruminantium (595) for sequencing. In addition 96
clones were selected randomly from each of the other
libraries for sequencing. The ciliates were maintained as
well-defined monocultures in fistulated sheep.

DNA sequencing was performed on sequencers purchased
from either PE Applied Biosystems, Beckman Coultard or
Shimazu (PE Applied Biosystems ABI 373A and 377, a
Genetic Analyzer – CEQ 8000 by Beckman).
ESTs sequences
4768 ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) of rumen Ciliates
were sequenced from 10 species of protozoa. Vectors and
linkers were automatically filtered out from the data. First
the vector pieces were detected using a Blastn search
against the pBKCMV vector sequence on a Paracel gene-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/22

matcher machine using the same parameters as VecScreen
(-q -5 -G 3 -E 3 -e 700 -Y 1.75e12 -F mD) [46].
Regions showing similarity to the pBKCMV vector were
trimmed from the ends of the sequences. If there was
remaining vector in the middle, it was removed and the
longer of the two remaining fragments was kept. Subsequently, sequences that had less than 100 bases after trimming were discarded. After this filtering procedure, the
dataset contained 4335 sequences.
Furthermore, the sequences were analyzed for contamination from other organisms by aligning against the EMBL
database using Megablast [47] (version 2.2.4 [Aug-262002]) (identity ≥94% and a match length ≥40% of the
sequence). This procedure removed 11 contaminated
sequences (mainly by Escherichia coli). The remaining
4324 sequences varied in size between 100 and 896 nucleotides (nt), with an average length of 527 nt. By homology with known proteins we could get an estimate of the
percentage of the genes covered by the Ciliate ESTs. The
homology covered from 3% to 100% of the length of a
known gene in another species, with a mean value of
57%. The 4324 sequences are distributed as follows: 715
sequences from P. multivesiculatum, 595 from Epi. ecaudatum, 543 from Eud. maggii, 1062 from Ent. caudatum, 27
from Ent. simplex, 10 from Dip. affine,151 from M.
medium, 546 from I. prostoma, 84 from I. intestinalis and
591 from Das. ruminantium.
Data storage and clustering
The sequences and the results of the analyses performed
were stored in a relational MySQL database. In order to
minimize the redundancy of the data, we aligned the dataset to itself using SWN (Smith-Waterman (SW) comparison at the nucleotide level). Sequences pairs having an
identity ≥97% over at least 100 bp were considered to be
from the same gene and were put in the same cluster.
Sequences sharing less or no sequence similarity can be in
the same cluster as long as they are linked via other
sequences.
Function assignment
Function assignment of the sequences was performed on
three levels:

1) The protein domain structure was predicted by comparing the Hidden Markov Models (HMM) from PFAM
(Protein Families Database) [48] with our dataset, using
an e-value threshold of 0.01. Analysis of the O-Glycosides
hydrolases was further performed with the CDD (Conserved Domain Database)[49] and SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) [50].

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:22

2) The cDNAs were assigned to COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of genes, [51]) based on sequence similarity to existing COGs in a Cognitor-like procedure [52].
The COG assignment yields a higher resolution prediction
of the molecular function than a gene family assignment
derived from PFAM. In addition, the COGs provide a classification of cellular roles for all the molecular protein
functions that we used to classify the EST data. The COG
database contains a set of all proteins and protein fragments (for fusion proteins) from a set of 66 complete unicellular genomes (COG) and a set of 7 complete
eukaryotic genomes (KOG). All proteins are compared to
the COG and KOG sets using SWX (SW comparison of
DNA translated in the six reading frames against a protein
database). We use a conservative variant of the Cognitor
to match cDNAs to a COG: when the three first significant
(e < 0.01) hits of the query sequence match the same
COG, then this COG is assigned to that region of the
query sequence. In the results we used the notation
"KOG/COG" because we used the information from both
sets. We first examine the KOG (eukaryotic set); in cases
where no KOG was attributed to the EST sequence, the
COG information was used.
3) Sequences were compared to version 42.8 of the Swissprot database (January 2004) to annotate each sequence
according to a restricted vocabulary. This comparison was
performed with SWX. Sequences with significant matches
(e-value < 1.10–5) were annotated according to their most
significant hit.
In addition, the CAZy database which contains the
description of enzymes degrading, modifying, or creating
glycosidic bonds[53], and the KEGG database which contains a description of enzymes and their pathway [54]
were used in the analysis.
All sequence comparisons were run on a Paracel Genematcher using the Smith-Waterman [55] algorithm for
pairwise sequence comparisons and Hidden Markov
Models for sequence-to-profile comparisons. The output
was subsequently analyzed in a Linux environment using
Perl scripts.
Best Hit
We performed a SWX search against all complete proteomes (see below; e-value < 0.01) to find in which species we encountered the most similar sequence (Best Hit).
Including other ciliate genomes
Within the set of 148 predicted proteomes, Plasmodium
falciparum (Apicomplexa), is evolutionarily the closest
organism to the Ciliates. In order to distinguish events
that could have occurred in the Ciliates before their colonization of the rumen environment from more recent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/22

events in the rumen we added the nucleotide data from
the non-rumen ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila (Tetrahymena Genome Database) to our analyses.
First a tSWX (a SW search with translated nucleotides
against a translated nucleotides database) comparison
against the T. thermophila genome was performed. (nov.
2003, TIGR; E-value threshold 1.10–5, match length > 30
amino acids). The T. thermophila matching sequences were
retrieved and translated in the 6 frames. The frame that
matched the rumen ciliate was included in the tree (see
below).
Phylogenetic analyses
To derive a phylogenetic tree for each cluster of ESTs we
used the following procedure: First the longest sequence
of the cluster was translated into six reading frames and
used as a query to search the published genomes. Homologous sequences were retrieved using SWP (SW at the protein level) with an e-value threshold of 1.10–5, T.
thermophila homologs were added when available, and the
EST was aligned with its homologs using ClustalW [56].
Subsequently phylogenetic trees were constructed using
Neighbor-Joining as implemented in ClustalW (excluding
positions with gaps and using 1000 bootstraps). The multiple alignments are based on the Ciliate EST sequences
compared with the full length sequences of the other
organisms. Trees are constructed solely based on the
homologous positions after selecting the conserved positions and removing the gaps from the alignment The minimal number of conserved positions used to construct the
tree is 58 amino acids (except for one xylanase that was
much shorter but was based a on manual check of the
alignment and of the sequences present). The maximal
length was 369 amino acids, the mean length was 172.5
amino acids.

Those ciliate sequences that clustered within a bacterial
partition of the tree were considered HGT candidates. To
automatically detect such cases, an algorithm examined
the species composition of the "tree neighbourhood" of
the ciliate sequence. By requiring that the second-smallest
partition containing the ciliate sequence (Figure 3) is fully
composed of bacterial sequences (plus our ciliate
sequence) we assured that the ciliate sequence clustered
"within" the bacterial sequences. In principle we do not
know the root of the tree, and it is therefore hard to argue
that when a query sequence clusters within a set of Bacterial sequences it is actually derived from a Bacterial
sequence. The principle of selecting the second-smallest
partition is that we assume that the root of the tree lies
outside that (small) partition.
Subsequently for the selected cases we obtained high
quality trees with a different methodology. We used Mus-

A likely horizontally transferred gene in Entodinium. The tree contains the target sequence (AM054010) and its homologuous proteins. To determine whether the target sequence is HGT candidate, an algorithm examines the presence or
absence of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes in the second smaller partition containing the target sequence. In the example,
the smallest second partition containing the target sequence contains also the sequences from Bacillus halodurans, Xanthomonas
axonopodis, Xanthomonas campestris and Thermotoga maritima, which are all Bacteria. AM054010 was therefore retained as a
HGT candidate.

cle [57] to obtain the sequence alignments, and for the
positions without gaps we obtained phylogenies using
Maximum Likelihood as calculated by MrBayes [58,59],
using four gamma-distributed rate categories plus invariant positions and the Poisson amino acid similarity
matrix. Again the "second-smallest partition" algorithm
was used to obtain HGT candidates.
For the HGT candidates identified here, the annotations
(See previous paragraph) were manually examined based
on their phylogenetic tree, to assure that sequences were
orthologous to annotated proteins, and their domain
compositions.

Proteomes

included 16 archaeal, 116 bacterial and 16 eukaryotic proteomes. (A complete list of the proteomes included can be
