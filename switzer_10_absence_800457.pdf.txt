Abstract
Background: XMRV, a xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-related virus, was recently identified by PCR testing in
67% of persons with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and in 3.7% of healthy persons from the United States. To
investigate the association of XMRV with CFS we tested blood specimens from 51 persons with CFS and 56 healthy
persons from the US for evidence of XMRV infection by using serologic and molecular assays. Blinded PCR and
serologic testing were performed at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and at two additional
laboratories.
Results: Archived blood specimens were tested from persons with CFS defined by the 1994 international research case
definition and matched healthy controls from Wichita, Kansas and metropolitan, urban, and rural Georgia populations.
Serologic testing at CDC utilized a Western blot (WB) assay that showed excellent sensitivity to MuLV and XMRV
polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, and no reactivity on sera from 121 US blood donors or 26 HTLV-and HIV-infected
sera. Plasma from 51 CFS cases and plasma from 53 controls were all WB negative. Additional blinded screening of the
51 cases and 53 controls at the Robert Koch Institute using an ELISA employing recombinant Gag and Env XMRV
proteins identified weak seroreactivity in one CFS case and a healthy control, which was not confirmed by
immunofluorescence. PCR testing at CDC employed a gag and a pol nested PCR assay with a detection threshold of 10
copies in 1 ug of human DNA. DNA specimens from 50 CFS patients and 56 controls and 41 US blood donors were all
PCR-negative. Blinded testing by a second nested gag PCR assay at the Blood Systems Research Institute was also
negative for DNA specimens from the 50 CFS cases and 56 controls.
Conclusions: We did not find any evidence of infection with XMRV in our U.S. study population of CFS patients or
healthy controls by using multiple molecular and serologic assays. These data do not support an association of XMRV
with CFS.
Background
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a complex illness that
affects between 0.5 and 2 percent of adults in the U.S.
[1,2]. CFS is characterized by a severe debilitating fatigue
lasting at least six consecutive months that is not allevi* Correspondence: bswitzer@cdc.gov

ated with rest. Individuals with CFS also report various
cognitive, sleep and musculoskeletal pain disturbances,
and symptoms similar to those of infectious diseases [3].
At least a quarter of those suffering from CFS are unemployed or receiving disability because of the illness; the
average affected family forgoes $20,000 annually in lost
earnings and wages; and, the annual value of lost productivity in the United States is at least $9 billion [2,4-6].

proven difficult to devise because the etiology,
pathophysiology and risk factors for CFS remain unclear
[3,7].
Because the symptoms characterizing CFS resemble
those of infectious diseases, many studies have investigated a viral etiology in CFS. However, involvement of
several viruses including human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6),
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), various enteroviruses, and the
human T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2) has not
been conclusively proven [3,7-10]. In October 2009,
Lombardi et al. reported finding a gammaretrovirus
called xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus
(XMRV) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
DNA from about 67% (68/101) of CFS patients compared
to only 3.6% (5/218) of healthy persons using PCR testing
[11]. Virus isolation and antibody detection were also
reported in some CFS patients [11].
XMRV is phylogenetically related to the xenotropic
murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) sharing about 94%
nucleotide identity across the viral genome [12]. XMRV
was initially identified in prostate tissues from about 10%
of prostate cancer patients using microarray and PCR
analysis [12]. XMRV prevalence in this study was higher
in patients with an inherited mutation in the RNase L
gene [12]. More recent studies examining XMRV prevalence in prostate tissues of patients with prostate cancer
from the US and Europe have reported both negative and
positive findings [13-15], highlighting the need for more
studies to assess the role of XMRV in prostate cancer.
Confirmation of an association and etiologic role of
XMRV in CFS is important because it could provide a
useful diagnostic test and might lead to new treatment
interventions. However, two recent studies of CFS
patients from the United Kingdom using PCR testing
alone or together with serologic testing reported negative
XMRV results in 186 and 170 CFS patients, respectively
[16,17]. XMRV was also not found by PCR testing of 32
CFS patients and 43 matched controls from the Netherlands [18]. Additional studies of different patient cohorts,
including those from the US, are critical to better evaluate both a possible association of XMRV with CFS and a
potential geographic link.
We describe here results from the first US study following the initial report by Lombardi et al. [11]. Testing of 51
specimens from CFS patients and 56 matched and
healthy controls from the US was performed independently in three laboratories for XMRV DNA by using several PCR tests and for anti-XMRV antibodies using
different serological assays.

Results
Absence of XMRV antibodies in persons with CFS and
healthy controls

Serologic testing at CDC was performed with a newly
developed WB assay using a strategy employed success-

fully for assessing human infection with other zoonotic
retroviruses [19,20]. The WB test used lysate from polytropic MuLV (PMLV)-infected HeLa cells as antigen.
PMLV and XMRV are highly related. They share between
87 and 93% nucleotide identity across the genome with
XMRV and also have 88 - 97% and 88 - 91% amino acid
identity to XMRV Gag and Env proteins, respectively.
Partial Gag (123 aa) and Env (55 aa) sequences from our
polytropic HeLa isolate share 96% and 90% identity to
XMRV, respectively. Thus, excellent antigenic cross-reactivity between XMRV and our polytropic HeLa isolate is
expected. Specimens were tested for reactivity in parallel
against control antigens from uninfected HeLa cell
lysates. Positive seroreactivity was defined as detection of
bands in the infected lysates corresponding to known
viral antigens and a lack of similar reactivity in uninfected
lysates to exclude nonspecific reactivity. Four available
antisera demonstrated good antigenic reactivity to Gag
and/or Env proteins (Figures 1 and 2): Goat anti-MuLV
polyclonal antisera to whole virus and to p69/71 Env proteins, rabbit anti-XMRV polyclonal antiserum to whole
virus, and rat monoclonal antibody to the Env of spleen
focus forming virus (SFFV), a polytropic MuLV, that
reacts with gp69/71 Env of polytropic and xenotropic
MuLV [21]. The anti-XMRV antiserum was used previously to detect XMRV in prostate cancer tissues by
immunohistochemistry [13]. The anti-SFFV antibody
was used by Lombardi et al. in a flow-based antibody
competition assay to detect antibodies to XMRV Env in
CFS patients [11]. All positive control antisera were reactive at high titers to various Gag and/or Env proteins (Figures 1 and 2). The anti-MuLV whole virus antiserum and
the anti-XMRV polyclonal antiserum both reacted to the
p68/p80 Gag precursor and p30 Gag proteins at titers of
1:32,000 and 1:64,000 respectively (Figures 1 and 2). The
polyclonal anti-gp69/71 Env antiserum and the antiSFFV monoclonal antibody reacted with the Env gp69/71
doublet proteins (Figures. 1 and 2) at a titer of 1:8,000 and
1:32,000, respectively (Figures. 1 and 2). The same pattern of reactivity was seen using both the anti-MuLV
whole virus and anti-XMRV antisera though a higher
level of nonspecific reactivity was observed to the HeLa
lysates with the XMRV antisera (Figures 1 and 2). No specific reactivity was observed for the pre-immune goat
sera and to uninfected HeLa lysates (Figures 1 and 2).
1:500 dilutions of the whole virus and gp69/71 antisera
and a 1:50 dilution of pre-immune goat sera were then
used as positive and negative controls for testing patient
samples in the WB assay, respectively.
Plasma samples from 51 CFS cases and 53 healthy controls were diluted 1:50 and examined for seroreactivity to
bands corresponding to Gag (p30 or p68/80) and/or Env
(gp69/71 or p15E) proteins present in only the infected
lysate and not the uninfected lysate. We also tested sera
from 26 retrovirus-positive specimens (13 HTLV-1/2,

patients) and observed no reactivity to XMRV proteins
(data not shown) confirming a lack of cross-seroreactivity. In addition, we tested archived sera from 121 anonymous US blood donors; all were negative (data not
shown). Plasma samples from the 51 CFS patients and 53
healthy controls all tested negative for XMRV antibodies
in this assay. Plasma samples were not available from
three healthy controls. Typical WB results of CFS persons
are shown in Figure 3. Every plasma specimen demonstrated some level of background reactivity, but without
evidence of specific reactivity to Gag and/or Env proteins
(Figure 3). For example, plasma from a CFS person
showed reactivity to two proteins about 65 and 69 kD in
size in the infected cell lysate but reacted non-specifically

to proteins of the same size in the uninfected antigen and
was thus considered seronegative (lane 2 of Figure 3).
There were no clear differences in nonspecific WB seroreactivity observed in healthy persons compared to persons with CFS (data not shown).
Blinded serologic testing of these same CFS and control
specimens was also performed at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Germany using ELISAs containing recombinant XMRV Gag and Env proteins [14]. Plasma from 51
CFS cases and 53 healthy controls were not reactive in
the recombinant XMRV Gag ELISA using either the Nor the C-terminus of the protein [14]. Two specimens,

assay cutoff of 0.2 OD units (Figure 4) [14]. However,
both specimens were negative by IFA testing using 293T
cells expressing either XMRV Gag or Env proteins and
were thus considered negative. Two blinded positive control specimens each consisting of goat polyclonal MuLV
whole virus antisera diluted 1:100 in pre-immune goat
sera both tested positive in the recombinant Gag ELISAs
but were negative in the Env ELISA. These results are
consistent with the seroreactivity of these polyclonal antisera to only Gag proteins in the WB assay. Five undiluted
pre-immune goat sera all tested negative in both the Gag
and Env ELISAs. These "external" positive and negative
controls were included as a separate set of specimens and
were all correctly detected in a blinded fashion. Testing of
the blinded human and goat control specimens was performed separately since different secondary antibody
conjugates are used for these different specimens. Internal positive and negative controls were also included in

each run and performed as expected. Like the WB testing, the goat anti-MuLV whole virus and anti-MuLV p70
polyclonal antisera gave titers of 1:64,000 and 1:6,400 in
the Gag and Env ELISAs, respectively.
Absence of XMRV sequences in PBMC DNA from persons
with CFS and healthy controls

We used two PCR assays at CDC to detect XMRV DNA.
The first assay was a nested gag PCR test used previously
to identify XMRV sequences in prostate cancer patients
and CFS patients [11,12]. The second nested PCR assay
was designed on highly conserved polymerase (pol)
sequences within xenotropic and other MuLV strains.
Serial, ten-fold dilutions of full-length XMRV(VP62)
plasmid (kindly provided by Robert Silverman) in a background of human DNA (PBMC or whole blood) showed
that the nested gag and pol PCR tests each detected 10
XMRV copies in different experiments on subsequent

These results show that both PCR assays have an excellent sensitivity for detecting XMRV in one ug of DNA

donors was also tested and found to be negative in both
PCR assays. These 41 blood donors are distinct from the

US blood donors whose plasmas were tested in the WB

Envelope (Env) ELISA results for 50 CFS cases and 49 healthy persons identified after unblinding. Specimens coded with W and G1-G50 are from the
population-based study in Wichita and Georgia, respectively; specimens G59 - G75 are from physician-referred CFS cases from the Georgia Registry
study. Specimens from a healthy control and a person with CFS, coded as G6 and G9 respectively, were weakly seroreactive in this test but were not
confirmed by either Western blot or immunofluorscence testing. Human sera were diluted 1:200. The human negative control serum was obtained
from a healthy volunteer previously determined to be seronegative. The polyclonal mouse Env antiserum was diluted 1:100. Assay cut-off was determined by the mean of the test samples plus three standard deviations.

testing showed that XMRV gag and pol sequences were
not detected in 1 ug of PBMC (n = 31) or whole blood (n
= 19) DNA from the CFS patients or in 1 ug PBMC DNA
from the 56 healthy controls. A representative Southern
blot of the XMRV pol PCR testing of persons with CFS is
shown in Figure 5. Matching DNA was not available from
one CFS case.
Blinded PCR testing performed at an independent
institution (Blood Systems Research Institute (BSRI), CA)
using a second nested PCR assay for XMRV gag DNA
sequences, with a sensitivity of 3 copies per reaction, was
also negative using 100 ng DNA specimens from all 50
CFS cases and 56 healthy controls (data not shown). 250

ng of DNA from the Georgia Registry patients also tested
negative using this nested gag PCR test (Figure 6). Four
blinded, "external" control specimens, included with the
panel of human specimens and spiked with 4, 40, 400, and
4000 XMRV plasmid copies in 100 ng of human DNA,
were all detected by this testing (data not shown).

Discussion
We found no evidence of infection with XMRV among
persons with CFS or matched healthy controls from the
US by testing with multiple serologic and PCR assays performed independently in three laboratories blinded to the
clinical status of the study participants. Our results con-

Lombardi et al. among both CFS patients and controls,
but are in agreement with recent data reported in two
large studies in the UK and a smaller study in the Netherlands that could not detect XMRV sequences in CFS
patients and one UK study that also failed to detect specific XMRV neutralizing antibody responses in CFS
[11,16-18]. Combined, these negative data do not support
XMRV as the etiologic agent of the majority of CFS cases.
Several possibilities could explain these discordant
results, including technical differences in assays used for
the testing in each study. However, the inability of four

independent laboratories to replicate the high XMRV
prevalence in CFS cases reported by Lombardi et al. cannot be explained by minor differences in assays used in
each study. In addition, testing at CDC utilized the nested
XMRV gag PCR assay used by Lombardi et al. and Urisman et al. to identify XMRV infection in CFS and prostate cancer patients, respectively [11,12]. Further, to
improve assay sensitivity, we used 1 ug of input DNA
which is 4-5 times higher than that used by others [1113,16,17], all while maintaining an assay sensitivity of 10
copies. To ensure that our testing would not miss genetically diverse XMRV or MuLV strains, we also used a sensitive nested PCR assay with conserved pol gene primers
and found that this testing was also negative confirming
the absence of XMRV/MuLV sequences. While PBMC
DNA was used in the majority of specimens, 1 ug whole
blood DNA was also used in testing 19 CFS cases. This
input DNA represents about 350 ng of PBMC DNA
which is similar to the amount used by others [1113,15,16], thus not affecting the sensitivity of our results.
The negative PCR findings were confirmed by an independent laboratory with a second nested gag PCR assay
which provided additional evidence for the absence of
XMRV sequences among CFS cases and controls. The
primary PCR amplification used in this second test is also
that used by Lombardi et al. which when combined with
a nested PCR step has a 3-copy detection threshold.
Antibody responses particularly to Gag and Env proteins are hallmarks of immune responses to retroviral
infections including experimental XMRV infection of
macaques [22]. We used a new WB assay to test for antiXMRV antibodies and showed by using both monoclonal
antibodies and polyclonal antisera that this assay
detected specifically, and with high titers, reactivity to
both XMRV and MuLV Gag and Env proteins. We were
unable to detect antibodies to XMRV Gag and Env in any
of the CFS and controls specimens by using this WB
assay. Likewise, negative results were obtained in a second, independent laboratory by using XMRV-specific
ELISA-based and IFA assays. Thus, the observed negative
serologic results for all CFS patients reflect an absence of
antibody responses and active XMRV infection. Although
limited, the negative WB serology observed in 56 healthy
controls and 121 blood donors also suggests that the
XMRV seroprevalence in this population is not high.
Screening of larger numbers of US blood donors using a
high throughput ELISA followed by confirmation in a
WB test also showed uncommon seropositivity (~0.1%)
[22]. More studies, however, are needed to determine the
prevalence of XMRV in healthy populations.
One current limitation of our study, and of others performing serologic and PCR testing for XMRV, is the
absence of bona fide positive and negative control specimens from infected and uninfected humans to determine

Switzer et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:57
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/57

the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the detection
assays. Until panels of well-characterized clinical specimens become available, assay validation will be limited to
reagents generated experimentally, such as polyclonal
and monoclonal antibodies, XMRV plasmids, and
XMRV-infected cells.
The selection criteria with which persons with CFS
were included in these various studies may also help to
explain the incongruent XMRV findings. The study by
Lombardi et al. used samples from the Whittemore Peterson Institute National Tissue Repository reported to contain specimens from well-characterized cohorts of CFS
[11]. Yet, the paper provides no information regarding the
repository or concerning the nature of these cohorts
other than that they were collected from private medical
practices in several regions of the U.S. where clusters of
CFS have been documented [11]. An absence of details of
the CFS cases and controls in this report makes it difficult
to replicate and interpret their findings. In contrast,
patients in the UK and Netherland studies were typical of
CFS patients seen in specialist clinical services in those
countries and resemble persons seen in other specialist
CFS services in the US and Australia [16-18]. Almost half
of the UK CFS patients described onset of their illness as
related to an acute viral disease [16,17]. Thus, they would
appear quite comparable to those in the study by Lombardi et al. Similarly, our study also failed to detect
XMRV infection in 18 CFS patients referred to a fatigue
registry by health care providers in Georgia and included
three persons who reported sudden onset to their illness.
Our study is the first to evaluate XMRV infection in persons with CFS and healthy controls from the general populations of Wichita and Georgia. These CFS cases are
different from CFS patients seen in general practice and
referral clinics; of the participants from the populationbased study in Georgia, only half had consulted a physician because of their fatigue, about 16% had been diagnosed with CFS, and 75% described an insidious onset to
their illness that had no obvious relation to an acute
infectious disease. Nonetheless, results from our general
population cohort extend the examination of XMRV in
CFS to persons whose illness developed gradually, for the
most part, rather than acutely. Our negative findings, in
conjunction with those in Europe [16-18], indicate no discernable association of XMRV with a wide spectrum of
CFS cases. The negative results for CFS patients and controls from the US in the current study also do not support
a continental clustering of XMRV infection suggested by
the absence of infection in the UK and Netherlands [1618]. However, our findings may not be generalizable
beyond our study populations because XMRV infection
rates may vary in different regions or locales.
CFS is a diagnosis of exclusion based on self-reported
symptoms and requires careful medical and psychiatric
evaluations to rule out conditions with similar clinical

Page 8 of 13

presentation. Our study and the negative reports from
the UK and the Netherlands evaluated patients for exclusionary conditions and defined CFS according to criteria
of the 1994 International CFS Research Case Definition
[23] or the earlier Oxford case definition [24]. The Lombardi et al. study specifies that samples were selected
from patients fulfilling the 1994 international CFS case
definition [23] and the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria
for CFS/ME [25]. Lombardi et al. did not specify if
patients were evaluated for exclusionary conditions, or if
the study subjects met both definitions, or which patients
met either CFS definition. The 1994 International CFS
case definition and the Canadian Consensus Criteria are
different and do not necessarily identify similar groups of
ill persons. Most notably, the Canadian Criteria include
multiple abnormal physical findings such as spatial instability, ataxia, muscle weakness and fasciculation, restless
leg syndrome, and tender lymphadenopathy. The physical
findings in persons meeting the Canadian definition may
signal the presence of a neurologic condition considered
exclusionary for CFS and thus the XMRV positive persons in the Lombardi et al. study may represent a clinical
subset of patients [11].
CFS is a complex disease with various clinical subtypes
proposed which could also account for differences in the
results obtained in each study [11,16-18]. While there is
still no universal agreement on a precise clinical presentation encompassing CFS illness, defining patient characteristics in studies of CFS etiology or pathogenesis
remains crucial for making comparisons across various
research conclusions.

Conclusions
In our study population of CFS and healthy persons from
the US, we did not find any evidence of infection with
XMRV using PCR and serologic methods performed
independently in three laboratories blinded to the clinical
status of the study participants. These results do not support an association of XMRV with CFS.
Methods
Study population and specimen preparation

The CDC Institutional Review Board reviewed and
approved all study protocols. All participants were volunteers and provided informed consent. Laboratory testing
of the samples was performed anonymously and blinded
to clinical status.
Details of our two study populations have been
described previously [2,26,27]. Briefly, between 2002 and
2003 we sampled adults 18 to 59 years old from Wichita,
Kansas [26,27] and between 2008 and 2009 we sampled
adults 18 to 59 years old from metropolitan, urban, and
rural Georgia [2]. In both studies, we used random digitdial screening interviews to classify household residents
as either well or having symptoms of CFS. A follow-up

Switzer et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:57
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/57

detailed telephone interview was administered to all individuals with symptoms and to a probability sample of
those without symptoms. Based on the detailed interview, those meeting criteria of the 1994 International CFS
Research Case Definition [23] were classified as CFS-like
and other respondents classified as either unwell (not
CFS-like) or well. All CFS-like individuals were recruited
and a random sample of those who were unwell but not
CFS-like, and a set of matched (sex, age, race/ethnicity,
geographic) well people were recruited for a 1-day clinical
evaluation.
We also tested specimens from CFS cases identified in
a CDC Health Care Provider-based Registry of Unexplained Fatiguing Illnesses and CFS (unpublished).
Between October 2008 and December 2009, healthcare
providers practicing in Bibb County, GA referred adolescents and adults 12 - 59 years old who met criteria for
unexplained fatiguing illness (fatigue for > 1 month), and
having at least one other core CFS symptom during that
period (unrefreshing sleep, problems with cognition or
memory, joint or muscle pain in extremities), and did not
have an exclusionary medical or psychiatric condition.
All referred patients underwent a telephone screening
interview to document fatigue lasting > 6 months, and
the presence of at least one core symptom and no exclusionary conditions. Patients meeting these criteria underwent the same 1-day clinical evaluation as persons from
our population-based studies, described in detail below.
Clinical assessment

Clinical evaluations involved: 1. Administration of standardized questionnaires to measure the 3 domains of the
1994 CFS case definition [23]: the Multidimensional
Fatigue Inventory (MFI) to measure 5 dimensions of
fatigue [28] the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36
(SF-36) to evaluate 8 dimensions of functional impairment [29]; and the CDC Symptom Inventory to evaluate
occurrence/frequency/severity of the 8 CFS-accompanying symptoms [30]; 2. A standardized physical examination conducted by a specifically trained physician who
also reviewed past medical history, review of systems,
and current medications/supplements; 3. Collection of
blood and urine for routine clinical analyses [23,31]; 4. A
standardized psychiatric evaluation conducted by specifically trained psychiatric interviewers - Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) in Wichita [32] and the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID) in Georgia [33].
The physician's evaluation and routine clinical laboratory tests served to identify medical conditions considered exclusionary for CFS, specified in the 1994 case
definition [23] as further clarified by the International
CFS Study Group in 2003 [31]. The psychiatric interview
served to identify current psychiatric disorders considered exclusionary for CFS, which included current mel-

Page 9 of 13

ancholic depression, current or lifetime bipolar disorder
or psychosis, substance abuse within 2 years and eating
disorders within 5 years [23,31].
Illness classification

Following clinical evaluation, participants who had no
exclusionary medical or psychiatric conditions were diagnosed with CFS if they met criteria of the 1994 international case definition [23] as quantified by the CDC
Symptom Inventory and ancillary criteria of the MFI and
SF-36 [26,31]. We used the MFI to assess fatigue status
[28]. For classification as CFS, those with a score ≥ wellpopulation medians on the general fatigue or reduced
activity scales of the MFI were considered to meet fatigue
criteria of the 1994 international case definition. Functional impairment was assessed by the medical outcomes
survey short form-36 (SF-36) [29]. For classification as
CFS, those with a score ≤ 25th percentile of population
norms in the physical function or role physical, or social
function, or role emotional subscales of the SF-36 were
considered to have substantial reduction in activities as
specified in the 1994 definition. Those who met at least
one but not all 1994 criteria were considered unwell not
CFS. Those who met none of the criteria were considered
well.
Specimens were available from 89 persons (33 CFS and
56 well controls) from the population-based case-control
studies and 18 CFS persons from the Registry study
described above. Subjects were included based on availability of specimens, and comprised 11 of 43 persons with
CFS and 26 of 53 healthy controls from Wichita, KS and
22 of 32 persons with CFS and 30 of 51 healthy controls
from Georgia. Persons with CFS and healthy controls had
similar mean ages, similar predominance of females and
white race, and had a similar mean body mass index
(BMI) (Table 1). Subjects with CFS had been ill on average 13.9 years (median 11.15 yrs, range 3 - 40 yrs), were
severely fatigued (MFI General Fatigue 16.5, range 10 20; MFI Reduced Activity 12.8, range 4 - 20) and severely
impaired (SF-36 physical functioning 65.5, range 10-100);
SF-36 bodily pain 48.8, range 12 - 84), and 3/33 (9%)
reported sudden onset to their illness. Clinical and demographic characteristics of subjects with specimens available for this study did not differ from those persons who
did not have ample specimen volumes and case-control
matching was maintained.
18 of 38 persons enrolled in the Registry study had a
diagnosis of CFS and were available for the current study.
These provider-referred CFS patients had a mean age of
42.8 years (SEM = 2.85 years), and were predominantly
white [17/18, (94.4%)] and female [16/18 (88.99%)]. They
had suffered fatigue for an average of 9.4 years (range: 1 35 years) and 3/18 (16.7%) reported sudden onset to their
illness.

Specimen collection, processing, storage

Fresh whole blood was collected in either CPT Vacutainer tubes containing sodium citrate and a blood separation reagent (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) for the
Georgia and Wichita studies or in PAXgene tubes for the
Georgia CFS Registry study and transported to CDC.
Blood was also collected in PAXgene tubes for two persons from the Georgia population-based study. PAXgene
tubes were gently inverted 5 times, stored overnight at 20°C, and then transferred to -70°C until DNA isolation
was performed. PBMCs and plasma were immediately
isolated by centrifugation of the CPT tubes. PBMCs were
stored in liquid nitrogen under conditions designed to
maintain viability. Plasma was aliquoted and stored at 80°C within 4 hours of blood collection. For samples collected from persons living in Wichita, KS and from the
Georgia CFS Registry study, whole blood was also collected in EDTA Vacutainer tubes. Plasma was recovered
from the EDTA-treated blood by centrifugation at 15,000
× g for 20 minutes and aliquoted and frozen at -80°C until
use. Plasma samples were aliquoted again when thawed
for WB testing; the remaining aliquots were re-frozen at 80°C.
DNA was extracted from cryopreserved PBMCs or frozen whole blood with the Qiagen blood DNA minikit or

Qiagen PAXgene Blood DNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA),
respectively, then aliquoted and stored frozen at -80°C.
All PBMC samples had viabilities > 90% when they were
thawed for DNA isolation. Nucleic acid concentrations
were determined by spectrophotometry using the Nanodrop instrument (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE).
For the PCR testing at CDC, 1 ug of PBMC or whole
blood DNA was used. Integrity of the DNA specimens
was determined using β-actin PCR as previously
described [34]. Matching plasma or DNA was not available from three healthy persons from Wichita, KS and
one CFS case from Georgia, respectively. All specimen
preparation, tissue culture, and PCR testing was done in
physically isolated rooms to prevent contamination of
specimens.
Serologic Assays

HeLa cells were infected with supernatant from the
murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC, Manassas, VI) known to express polytropic and ecotropic MuLV
(PMLV and EMLV, respectively). To characterize the isolate that replicated in HeLa cells, a 166-bp RNA sequence
containing the variable region C of the envelope (Env)
surface protein was PCR-amplified from infected HeLa
cell tissue culture supernatants. Phylogenetic analysis of

Switzer et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:57
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/57

the env sequence showed that the isolate was a PMLV by
clustering tightly with other PMLV, and not EMLV (data
not shown). XMRV and PMLV are highly related sharing
between 87 - 94% nucleotide identity across their
genomes and 88 - 97% and 88 - 91% amino acid identity
to complete Gag and Env proteins, respectively. Indeed,
partial Gag (123 aa) and Env (55 aa) sequences from our
polytropic HeLa isolate share 96% and 90% identity to
XMRV, respectively. Thus, the high amino acid relatedness supports the use of this isolate for WB serologic testing. Infected and uninfected HeLa crude cell lysates were
prepared for WB testing as previously described [35].
Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined
using the BioRad DC Protein Assay (Hercules, CA).
Plasma or serum samples were diluted 1:50 and reacted
separately to 150 ug of infected and uninfected cell lysates
overnight at 4°C after protein separation through 4-12%
polyacrylamide gels and transfer to nytran membranes,
as previously described [35,36]. Seroreactivity in human
specimens was detected using peroxidase-conjugated
protein A/G (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and chemiluminescence (Amersham, Uppsala, Sweden) [35,36].
Since validated XMRV-positive human sera are not
currently available, we used experimentally derived polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies to assess antigenic reactivity of the WB assay. These reagents included
goat polyclonal antisera to MuLV (whole virus and gp69/
71Env, respectively) available at ATCC (VR-1537 and VR1521, respectively), and a rabbit anti-XMRV polyclonal
antiserum (kindly provided by Ila Singh) and a rat antiSFFV (7C10) monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by
Sandra Ruscetti) used previously to detect XMRV protein
expression and antibodies in prostate cancer and CFS
patients, respectively [11,13,21]. Peroxidase-conjugated
protein A/G or anti-rat antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MS)
was used to detect bound goat, rabbit, and rat antibodies,
respectively. Sensitivity of the assay was estimated using
two fold serial dilutions of the MuLV, XMRV, and SFFV
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Cross-reactivity
of the WB assay on HIV and HTLV positive plasma was
evaluated on 13 HTLV-1/2 positive, 7 HIV-1-positive,
and six HIV-1/HIV-2 dual positive plasma. In addition,
sera from 121 HIV and HTLV seronegative anonymous
US blood donors collected in 1998 were tested.
An aliquot of coded plasma from the CFS and healthy
controls was tested at RKI by an ELISA using recombinant Gag and Env proteins used recently to investigate
XMRV infection in German prostate cancer patients [14].
Briefly, recombinant proteins were coated overnight on
microtiter plates at room temperature in equimolar
amounts. The plates were blocked with 2% Marvel milk
powder in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h at
37°C, washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20.
Patient plasma diluted 1:200 in PBS with 2% milk powder

and 0.05% Tween20 were added into each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Each well was again washed
three times and a 1:1000 dilution of a goat anti-human
IgG-HRP conjugate (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany)
in PBS, 2% milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) was added. Following incubation for 1
hour at 37°C, each well was again washed three times,
and chromogen ortho-phenylendiamin (OPD) in 0.05 M
phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0 containing 4 μl of a 30%
solution of the hydrogen peroxide substrate per 10 ml
was added. After 5-10 minutes the color development
was stopped by addition of sulphuric acid and the absorbance at 492 nm/620 nm was measured in a microplate
reader. Positive controls included mouse anti-Gag and
Env antisera and pre-immune sera diluted 1:50 in PBS
with 2% milk powder and 0.05% Tween20. In addition, a
separate set of goat sera was also tested in a blinded fashion and included external positive and negative controls
consisting of dilutions of the MuLV whole virus, gp69/71
goat polyclonal antisera, or pre-immune goat sera,
respectively. Detection of antibody reactivity in the goat
sera was done by using rabbit anti-goat HRP conjugate
(Dako, Hamburg, Germany).
Samples reactive by ELISA testing were then re-tested
using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [14]. Briefly,
plasma specimens were diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer
and tested against 293T cells expressing codon optimized
synthetic full-length genes of the XMRV env or gag under
control of the CMV promoter and bound to glass slides,
as described in detail previously [14]. Following incubation for 60 min at 37°C, the slides were washed extensively with PBS and secondary antibodies conjugated to
fluorophores were added for 30 min. After thorough
washing steps with PBS, the cells were mounted in Mowiol and viewed on a Zeiss (LSM510) confocal laser-scanning microscope.
Detection of XMRV sequences

DNA specimens were screened by PCR at the CDC with
an XMRV-specific gag and a polymerase (pol) assay that
detects xenotropic and polytropic MuLV. The XMRV
specific assay uses the primers GAG-O-F and GAG-O-R
and GAG-I-F and GAG-I-R for the primary and nested
PCRs, respectively, and conditions as previously
described [11,12]. This is the same nested PCR test used
by Urisman et al. and Lombardi et al. to detect 413-bp
XMRV gag sequences in prostate cancer and CFS
patients, respectively [11,12]. The primers and probes of
the generic pol PCR assay were designed from an alignment of complete XMRV and prototypical xenotropic,
polytropic, and ecotropic MuLV genomes available at
GenBank (accession numbers: xenotropic (XMLV):
XMRV VP35 = DQ241301, XMRV VP62 = DQ399707,
XMRV VP42 = DQ241302, XMRV WPI-1106 =

MuLV BM5eco = AY252102.1, Moloney MuLV = J02255,
Rauscher MuLV = NC_001819, Friend MuLV = X02794).
The external external XPOLOF (5' CCG TGC CCA ACC
CTT ACA ACC TCT 3') and XPOLOR (5' CCG AGG
TTC CCT AGG GTT TGT AAT 3') and internal primers
XPOLIF (5' TCC ACC CCA CCA GTC AGC CTC TCT
3') and XPOLIR (5' AAG TGG CGG CCA GCA GTA
AGT CAT 3') were used to generically detect 216-bp
XMLV/XMRV pol sequences. All assays were optimized
to achieve the highest sensitivity in detecting XMRV
VP62 plasmid DNA in one ug of genomic DNA. One ug
of human DNA was used as input for the PCR tests. PCR
products were visualized by electrophoresis in an ethidium bromide-stained 1.8% agarose gel. To further
increase the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assays,
amplified gag and pol sequences were confirmed by
Southern blot analysis using the biotinylated oligoprobes
XGAGP2 (5' ACC TTG CAG CAC TGG GGA GAT GTC
3'), and XPOLP (5' TTG ATG AGG CAC TGC ACA
GAG ACC 3') and chemiluminescence detection. The
detection limit of the assays was evaluated using 10-fold
dilutions of XMRV VP62 plasmid diluted in a background of one ug of genomic human DNA. Assay specificity was evaluated using PBMC DNA from 41
anonymous US blood donors screened negative for HIV
and HTLV.
Nested PCR was also performed at BSRI using double
blinded genomic DNA specimens in order to independently test for XMRV gag sequences. The first round was
performed as previously described to detect XMRV in
PBMC DNA of CFS patients [11]. Briefly, 100 - 250 ng of
genomic DNA was amplified using outer gag primers
419F (5' ATC AGT TAA CCT ACC CGA GTC GGA C 3')
and 1154R (5' GCC GCC TCT TCT TCA TTG TTC TC
3') at a final concentration of 0.3 μM, HotStart-IT FideliTaq Master Mix (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and 1
mM magnesium chloride. PCR was performed using an
initial denaturation step at 94°C for 4 minutes followed by
45 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 57°C for 30 seconds and
72°C for 1 minute and a final extension step at 72°C for 2
minutes. Nested PCR was conducted using 1 μl of the
first round DNA in the second round reaction. Nested
primers 488F (5' GGG GAC GAG AGA CAG AGA CA
3') and 1107R (5' CAG AGG AGG AAG GTT GTG CT 3')
were used at a final concentration of 0.3 μM and amplification was performed using HotStart-IT FideliTaq. PCR

was performed using an initial denaturation step at 95°C
for 90 seconds followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 20 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 40 seconds and a
final extension step at 72°C for 2 minutes. PCR contamination occurring during nested PCR was evaluated by
including at least one third as many water controls as test
samples in each PCR experiment and were always negative.
Using serial dilutions of a cloned fragment of XMRV
gag as a positive control, the nested PCR assay could reliably detect at least 3 copies of DNA per reaction, even
when spiked into genomic DNA prepared either from
293FT cells or donor PBMCs previously validated to be
negative for XMRV. Controls of GAPDH (forward - 5'
CAT GTT CCA ATA TGA TTC AC 3'; reverse - 5' CCT
GGA AGA TGG TGA TG 3'; 75 ng genomic DNA, 3 minutes at 95°C followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 20 seconds,
55°C for 45 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds, followed by
1 cycle of 72°C for 2 minutes) were performed to ensure
similar levels of genomic DNA input in each PCR reaction.
