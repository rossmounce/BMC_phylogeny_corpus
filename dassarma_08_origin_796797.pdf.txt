Abstract
The consistent use of the taxonomic system of binomial nomenclature (genus and species) was first
popularized by Linnaeus nearly three-hundred years ago to classify mainly plants and animals. His
main goal was to give labels that would ensure that biologists could agree on which organism was
under investigation. One-hundred fifty years later, Darwin considered the term species as one of
convenience and not essentially different from variety. In the modern era, exploration of the
world's niches together with advances in genomics have expanded the number of named species
to over 1.8 million, including many microorganisms. However, even this large number excludes
over 90% of microorganisms that have yet to be cultured or classified. In naming new isolates in
the microbial world, the challenge remains the lack of a universally held and evenly applied standard
for a species. The definition of species based on the capacity to form fertile offspring is not
applicable to microorganisms and 70% DNA-DNA hybridization appears rather crude in light of
the many completed genome sequences. The popular phylogenetic marker, 16S rRNA, is tricky for
classification since it does not provide multiple characteristics or phenotypes used classically for
this purpose. Using most criteria, agreement may usually be found at the genus level, but species
level distinctions are problematic. These observations lend credence to the proposal that the
species concept is flawed when applied to prokaryotes. In order to address this topic, we have
examined the taxonomy of extremely halophilic Archaea, where the order, family, and even a genus
designation have become obsolete, and the naming and renaming of certain species has led to much
confusion in the scientific community.

Historical background
An important challenge in the classification of microorganisms is ensuring that scientists can follow the pedigree
of isolates in the literature. This laudable goal is however
especially difficult to achieve for microbes that have a
long history and where variants have been isolated and reisolated from an abundance of niches in the laboratories
of many different investigators. For example, the group of
extremely salt-loving halophilic microbes which produce

red, pink, and purple hues in hypersaline ponds used to
make salt from the sea, were among the earliest microorganisms to be recognized and described. They were, not
surprisingly, originally identified as agents of food spoilage, before the advent of refrigeration when salting was
widely used for preserving fish and meats [1]. Some early
isolates from dried and salted codfish (Klippfisch) were
documented in a 1919 review on causative agents of fish
reddening by the German botanist, Klebahn [2]. Notably,

he isolated and named "Bacillus halobius ruber", aware that
these bright vermillion halophilic microbes were not
spore formers, but his isolate was subsequently lost. A
dozen years later, halophilic isolates thought to be similar
to Klebahn's, were named "Bacterium halobium" by Petter
in the Kluyver laboratory in Delft, Holland [3]. In the
1940s–1960s, additional halophilic microorganisms were
isolated from different countries and reported in the scientific literature with names such as Halobacterium halobium, H. salinarium, and H. cutirubrum [4]. Many of these
isolates were deposited in US, Canadian, and European
culture collections, but a substantial number of them were
subsequently lost or renamed. Revision of the taxonomy
of these extremely halophilic genera from Bacillus to Bacterium to Halobacterium reflected the increasing sophistication of our knowledge of the microbial world during this
period, and these changes were generally accepted by the
scientific community. In the modern era, there have been
many more proposals for taxonomic revisions among
these halophiles, some of which have been readily acceptable, and others that have since been challenged or
refuted [5,6].

A proposal to modernize haloarchaeal
taxonomy and terminology
Among extremely halophilic microorganisms, the distinction of halophilic Archaea from halophilic Bacteria
became apparent in the 1970's through the molecular
phylogenetic work of Woese, who proposed the threedomain view of life. While halophilic microorganisms
represented many different taxonomic groups in the bacterial domain, those in the archaeal domain fell into a single order (Halobacteriales) and family (Halobacteriacae)
[7]. Our understanding of the existence of the three
domains has created ambiguity in the terminology used,
since 'halobacteria' traditionally referred to all extremely
halophilic microorganisms, including both halophilic
Bacteria and halophilic Archaea. In order to clarify the definitions, we propose that the term halobacteria be
reserved only for halophiles that are members of the bacterial domain, while haloarchaea be used only for halophiles that are members of the archaeal domain. In
addition, on a taxonomic level, the order Halobacteriales
should be designated as Haloarchaeales and the family
Halobacteriaceae should be as Haloarchaeaceae. Finally, the
Halobacterium genus would be better named Haloarchaeum to reflect its membership in the archaeal rather
than the bacterial domain. These revisions would help
update the taxonomy and terminology of halophilic
microorganisms to be consistent with our current understanding of the microbial world.

Taxonomic ambiguity among species
While our proposed revision of haloarchaeal taxonomy is
relatively simple, disentangling the taxonomy and pedi-

gree within the original genus, Halobacterium (Haloarchaeum), is considerably more complex. Over the past
twenty-five to fifty years, this genus witnessed a contraction in the number of recognized species from over a
dozen to just a single species. While some acquired new
genus designations (e.g. Halobacterium volcanii changed to
Haloferax volcanii and Halobacterium marismortui to Haloarcula marismortui), in 1990, Grant and Larsen proposed
combining three common species, Halobacterium halobium, H. salinarium, and H. cutirubrum, into a single one,
H. salinarium [7]. However, this proposal was not fully
accepted by the community since the changes were not
fully in accordance with the rules of the Bacteriological
Code [8]. In particular, halobium predated salinarium in
the literature and, by convention, the former name should
have taken precedence over the latter. To complicate matters further, in 1996, Ventosa and Oren proposed renaming of H. salinarium to H. salinarum [9], removing an "i",
in their opinion, for linguistic reasons. However, many
investigators dissented and continued to use the original
species designations. In Euzéby's List of Prokaryotic Names
with Standing in Nomenclature [10], he reported that salinarium, is derived from the Latin adjective salinarius a um,
meaning "of salt works", while salinarum is derived from
salinae arum, meaning "salt works", and concluded that
salinarium was indeed correct. There is no doubt that naming and renaming of these species has left the taxonomy
of Halobacterium (Haloarchaeum) species in disarray in the
literature and in the haloarchaeal community.
Perhaps the worst case of taxonomic ambiguity is for the
first Halobacterium (Haloarchaeum) isolate sequenced and
also the most widely used haloarchaeal strain, which was
published under the name H. halobium strain NRC-1 [11].
The origin of strain NRC-1 is uncertain, though it likely
appeared from the 1960's collection of W. Stoeckenius
and was disseminated via W.F. Doolittle (personal communications) to S. DasSarma in the 1980's. In 2000, the
NRC-1 strain was deposited by the DasSarma laboratory
in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC no.
700922) for standardization and distribution in the
research community and has since been used by Carolina
Biological Supply Company in the educational sphere
(Carolina no. 154777) [12]. Stocks of the original culture
used for sequencing are also maintained in the DasSarma
laboratory. As a result of uncertainties regarding the origin
of this strain, the authors of the complete genome
sequencing paper [11] dropped the species designation,
reverting to "Halobacterium sp. strain NRC-1", while its
pedigree was being rigorously established and the relationships within this group of organisms fully clarified.
However, despite the lack of appearance of definitive
information on the identity of NRC-1, Gruber et al. [13]
published a paper in 2004 reclassifying the wild-type isolate as a strain of the 'H. salinarum' species. In so doing,

these authors ignored a variety of differences between
strains, including their own pulsed-field gel patterns, as
well as variations in restriction maps of the unstable resident megaplasmids. Overreliance on phylogenetic trees
based on 16S rRNA sequences, some of which are already
known to be divergent even within single haloarchaeal
species [14], was a serious shortcoming of this study.
Reexamination of the available data on Halobacterium
(Haloarchaeum) isolates at the phylogenetic and taxonomic levels confirms the existence of serious complications. The 16S rRNA sequences vary in nearly all of the
originally distinct species, with that of NRC-1 and H. salinarium differing in several positions. Differences also exist
between the NRC-1 and H. halobium 23S rRNA sequences,
as well as between NRC-1 and H. cutirubrum 5S rRNA. In
fact, a recent publication even reported a major deletion
in the 16S rRNA promoter region of 'H. salinarum' (originally H. halobium) strain R-1 in comparison to strain
NRC-1 and other similar strains [15]. The most compelling case for the existence of substantial taxonomic diversity among Halobacterium (Haloarchaeum) isolates is from
the recent genotyping analysis of Cleland et al. using the
DiversiLab repPCR system [16]. In this study, some of the
seven Halobacterium (Haloarchaeum) strains in the ATCC
collection show differences quantitatively similar to
haloarchaea that are classified as different genera of the

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/5

Halobacteriaceae (Haloarchaeaceae) family. Their examination of NRC-1 by this method (Figure 1) showed that this
strain fell below 70% similarity compared to other 'H. salinarium' strains in ATCC, suggesting that NRC-1 should be
given an entirely new species designation using that criterion. This analysis supports our viewpoint that it is premature to reclassify all of these Halobacterium (Haloarchaeum)
isolates as a single species, especially without an existing
consensus in the community on the definition of what
constitutes a "species" among these organisms.

Phenotypes and pedigree
At the phenotypic level, Halobacterium (Haloarchaeum)
strains have some clear-cut differences. An especially striking difference is the absence, in 'H. salinarum' (e.g. strain
R-1), of gas vesicles, which are characteristic of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Gas vesicles permit NRC-1 to move vertically in the water column in response to oxygen, light, and
temperature, and the corresponding expression of gas vesicle protein genes can be clearly seen in DNA microarray
experiments [17,18]. The lack of gas vesicles in 'H. salinarum' indicates that these organisms exist in significantly
different environments from NRC-1, with the latter
inhabiting dynamic ones, and the former in more constant environments. This notable phenotypic difference is
easily visible even to the naked eye. Some other Halobacterium (Haloarchaeum) species contain two different mor-

phological types of gas vesicles in the same cell, those
which are narrower and diagnostic of species inhabiting
deep habitats, as well as those which are wider and found
in shallow brines (like NRC-1), suggesting the widespread
environmental distribution of these species. Examined
more broadly, isolate-specific differences have been
shown to exist at the level of antibiotic-resistance markers,
measured cations in cells, and protein, lipid, and sugar
content in the cell envelopes [4].
The pedigree of the various strains of Halobacterium
(Haloarchaeum) being studied in laboratories worldwide
is also confounding. One example is the unclear relationship between NRC-1 and R-1, and another similar strain
S-9, a purple membrane overproducer. While some investigators reported that NRC-1, R-1, and S-9, were very close
relatives [19], others indicated otherwise [20,21]. The stable gas vesicle-deficient strain, R-1, may be the parent of
S-9, a strain which was isolated after extensive chemical
mutagenesis, but R-1 is probably not a descendent of
NRC-1. Not surprisingly, the genome sequencing results
showed at least 200 kb of additional DNA in R-1 compared to NRC-1 and very little similarity in their resident
megaplasmids [15]. Many additional examples of incongruent taxonomy and pedigree among Halobacterium
(Haloarchaeum) species are reviewed by Grant and Larsen
[7] and Tindall [8]. Clearly, the frequent and questionable
revisions in the taxonomy of these interesting microbes,
and at times, the lack of careful maintenance and documentation of their pedigree, are a serious impediment to
advancing the field.

Epilogue
The incredible precision of the genomic era has empowered microbiologists with the genetic blueprints of more
than a thousand microorganisms and allowed for the
development of many new approaches for the interrogation of their biology. Unfortunately, studies of certain
microbes, such as the haloarchaea, have been made
exceedingly difficult by the arbitrary and unnecessary
renaming of strains, poor record keeping of pedigree, and
the lack of a universal definition of species. All of these
shortcomings make it likely that future generations will
not be able to fully interpret and utilize the current literature, ultimately diminishing the contributions of both
past and present generations. While rigorous genetic studies and complete genome sequences are destined to make
a permanent contribution to the field, taxonomic rearrangements based on inadequate experimentation and
flawed logic hold it back. Although these points resonate
especially true among the haloarchaea, we suspect that
similar taxonomic issues and challenges are quite widespread among other prokaryotes as well and are deserving
of further scrutiny.
