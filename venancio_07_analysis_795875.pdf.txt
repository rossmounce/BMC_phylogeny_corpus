Abstract
Background: Schistosoma mansoni is a blood helminth parasite that causes schistosomiasis, a
disease that affects 200 million people in the world. Many orthologs of known mammalian genes
have been discovered in this parasite and evidence is accumulating that some of these genes encode
proteins linked to signaling pathways in the parasite that appear to be involved with growth or
development, suggesting a complex co-evolutionary process.
Results: In this work we found 427 genes conserved in the Deuterostomia group that have
orthologs in S. mansoni and no members in any nematodes and insects so far sequenced. Among
these genes we have identified Insulin Induced Gene (INSIG), Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)
and vasohibin orthologs, known to be involved in mammals in mevalonate metabolism, immune
response and angiogenesis control, respectively. We have chosen these three genes for a more
detailed characterization, which included extension of their cloned messages to obtain full-length
sequences. Interestingly, SmINSIG showed a 10-fold higher expression in adult females as opposed
to males, in accordance with its possible role in regulating egg production. SmIRF has a DNA
binding domain, a tryptophan-rich N-terminal region and several predicted phosphorylation sites,
usually important for IRF activity. Fourteen different alternatively spliced forms of the S. mansoni
vasohibin (SmVASL) gene were detected that encode seven different protein isoforms including
one with a complete C-terminal end, and other isoforms with shorter C-terminal portions. Using
S. mansoni homologs, we have employed a parsimonious rationale to compute the total gene losses/
gains in nematodes, arthropods and deuterostomes under either the Coelomata or the Ecdysozoa
evolutionary hypotheses; our results show a lower losses/gains number under the latter
hypothesis.
Conclusion: The genes discussed which are conserved between S. mansoni and deuterostomes,
probably have an ancient origin and were lost in Ecdysozoa, being still present in Lophotrochozoa.
Given their known functions in Deuterostomia, it is possible that some of them have been co-opted
to perform functions related (directly or indirectly) to host adaptation or interaction with host
signaling processes.

Background
Schistosoma mansoni is a digenetic platyhelminth trematode and is one of the major causative agents of Schistosomiasis [1], a disease that affects 200 million infected
individuals and an additional 500–600 million are at risk
[2]. Schistosomiasis is a neglected disease occurring primarily in impoverished urban areas of developing countries and is considered not only a consequence of poverty,
but also a poverty-promoting condition in the affected
populations [3]. Parasite eggs laid in the hepatic portal
vasculature are the principal cause of morbidity, and the
ensuing pathology may prove fatal [4]. Inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases has been shown to interfere with egg
production and suggested as a novel strategy to combat
schistosomiasis [5]. Eggs are highly immunogenic and
capable of inducing potent Th responses [6]. Protective
immune mechanisms in humans that might form the
basis for a vaccine have proven difficult to characterize [7],
owing to effective immune evasion by the parasites. Active
interactions with the host play an important role in the
parasite immune evasion process, through detection of
hormones and other host signaling molecules [8].
Two large-scale independent efforts have obtained significant numbers of transcriptome sequences from S. mansoni [9] and S. japonicum [10], and the draft of the genome
sequence of S. mansoni is currently being assembled [11].
Recently, large-scale transcriptome sequencing of the
planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has provided molecular
information about a free-living platyhelminth [12]. These
datasets are the first large repository of mRNA sequences
for platyhelminth organisms and have therefore provided
insights into the evolution and molecular biology of these
organisms, as well as help in understanding adaptation to
parasitism of S. mansoni and identification of gene products to be exploited as novel drug targets and vaccine candidates. Using primarily the data generated by the S.
mansoni EST Genome Project [9] here we present a
detailed investigation of certain S. mansoni genes that we
believe provide important insights into the biology of this
organism.
The schistosoma genus is part of the platyhelminth phylum, which has been traditionally regarded as one of the
first diverging phyla of the bilaterian group in the acoelomate-pseudoceolomate-celomate (APC) theory (Figure
1A), which groups bilaterally symmetrical animals based
on the presence of coelom (a body cavity lined by an epithelium derived from mesenchyme, e.g. human pleural
cavity) [13,14]. This view is based on a gradualist scenario
in which the first bilaterian ancestral was acoelomate and
some of its descendants developed coelomic cavities originating the various coelomate phyla. Recent analysis of
molecular data and embryonic development suggested
that platyhelminths are not in the basal position of bilat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/407

eria, but are derived from an ancestral coelomate [15-17].
This new phylogeny classifies bilaterian animals in deuterostomes (the first opening, the blastopore, becomes the
anus) and protostomes (the first opening becomes the
mouth). The Deuterostomia group includes all chordates
and echinoderms. Protostomes are further divided in
Lophotrochozoa (animals with a feeding structure called
lophophore; e.g. platyhelminths, annelids and mollusks)
and Ecdysozoa (animals that undergo ecdysis or moulting, e.g. insects and nematodes) [15-17]. This hypothesis
is named LED (Lophotrochozoa-Ecdysozoa-Deuterostomia) (see Figure 1B).
Wolf et al. [18], analyzing the evolutionary relationships
between animal phyla using the predicted genes of fully
sequenced organisms, obtained strong statistical support
for the APC hypothesis (Figure 1A). Philippe et al. [15]
analyzing a few genes from multiple species (representing
several taxa) provided support for the LED hypothesis
(Figure 1B). Philippe and collaborators [15,16,19]
pointed out that despite the strong statistical support
argued by Wolf et al. [18], long-branch attraction artifacts
might have affected the results.
The LED hypothesis has been widely supported in the last
few years by innovative approaches, such as intron conservation analysis [20] and a whole genome phylogeny analysis excluding C. elegans fast-evolving sequence genes
[21]. However, there is also a recent phylogenetic analysis
using large scale molecular data that supports the APC

phylogeny [22]. Therefore, metazoan evolution is still an
open question in phylogenetics.

Results and Discussion
Our goal was to identify S. mansoni genes in the large transcriptome sequence collection that are conserved among
platyhelminths and Deuterostomia, thus providing new
insights into S. mansoni biology. The two major evolutionary theories of metazoans provided a framework for this
identification as follows. We selected three main taxonomic groups to focus our work on: Nematoda, Arthropoda and Deuterostomia. These groups are monophyletic
under both the APC and LED hypotheses (Figure 1A and
1B). We selected a total of 6,504 S. mansoni genes for
which we found orthologs in at least one organism representing at least one of our focus groups. We then determined the presence/absence of these genes in large
merged datasets (e.g. all nematodes, all arthropods; see
Methods for details). Of the selected 6,504 S. mansoni
genes, we found that 4,244 were present in at least one
organism from each of the other three clades, thus not
contributing to losses/gains at the clade level (Table 1). All
the other 2,260 genes in our analysis (Table 1 and Additional file 1) contributed to gene gain/loss event counts
(Table 1). Overall, there were 3,123 gain/loss events
under the APC hypothesis and 2,757 events under the
LED hypothesis. The excess of 366 events under the APC
hypothesis is statistically significant (p-value = 2.2 × 1016), which favors the LED theory under the parsimony
rationale [19].

We were primarily interested in the 427 genes from Group
2, i.e. genes conserved in schistosomes and deuterostomes, but absent in arthropods and nematodes (Table 1
and Additional file 1). Our rationale is that representative
genes from this set, being absent in arthropods and nematodes, provide insights into platyhelminth-specific biology. The complete list of 427 genes in Group 2 can be
found in Additional file 2. These genes were additionally
submitted to manual inspection and comparison to gene
data from the free-living non-parasite platyhelminth S.
mediterranea (a planarian). The S. mediterranea gene collection [12] is the only other major set of platyhelminth
data currently available.
We have found that 299 (70%) of the 427 S. mansoni
genes (Additional file 2) are not present in the S. mediterranea EST [12] and genomic sequence datasets. It is difficult to evaluate which proportion of these 299 genes are
actually present in S. mediterranea but perhaps not represented in this planarian partial sequence dataset. Further
detailed investigation is still needed to confirm their
absence in S. mediterranea.
The remaining 128 genes (30%) from Group 2 are shared
with S. mediterranea (Additional File 2). These genes may
play roles in platyhelminth-essential processes such as
long-term tissue maintenance and cell turnover that are
likely less important for short-lived organisms such as
nematodes and insects. The list includes genes from pathways related to egg production, such as synthesis of

* S. mansoni (Sm) genes were compared to genes from all organisms of the following clades: Nematodes (Nem), Arthropods (Arthr) and
Deuterostomes (Deut). Each group represents one of the possible cases: when S. mansoni genes were present in at least one organism of the
indicated clade it was marked with 1; when genes were absent from all organism of that clade it was marked with 0. For example, group 1
represents the case where 4,244 S. mansoni genes were present in all three clades studied, and therefore no loss/gain events were computed;
similarly, group 2, represents the case where 427 S. mansoni genes were not present in Nematodes or Arthropods, and under the APC hypothesis
two loss/gain events per gene were computed, whereas under the LED hypothesis only one event per gene was counted. A schematic
representation of these cases and the minimal number of events required under either of the two hypotheses is shown in Additional file 1. ** Pvalue was calculated using 100,000 bootstrapped samples followed by Wilcoxon Test.

mevalonate, as will be discussed later. Egg deposition is an
essential step in the platyhelminth life-cycle and is the
major cause of morbidity in the human host.
Out of the 427 genes in Group 2 we have selected three for
further extensive investigation, characterizing their fulllength sequence and pattern of expression, as described
next. All three genes are also present in S. mediterranea; we
believe that their putative roles in host interaction and signaling warrant special attention.
Insulin Induced Gene (INSIG)
Among genes in Group 2, one of the most interesting is a
S. mansoni INSIG ortholog (SmINSIG), an important regulator of the mevalonate synthesis pathway.

INSIG-1 in cultured mammalian CHO cells has been
shown to play an essential role in degradation of HMGCoA reductase (a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway) [23]. In S. mansoni, HMG-CoA reductase is vital for
parasite survival and plays a physiological role in regulating egg production [24,25]. Egg deposition is a characteristic of platyhelminths, and in the case of S. mansoni the
parasite's eggs deposited in the host circulatory system are
the major cause of morbidity in the host's liver.
The full-length message of SmINSIG was obtained by RTPCR. The reverse primer for RT-PCR was designed from
the 3' end of a consensus sequence obtained by the S.
mansoni Assembled EST designated SmAE C601385.1 and
annotated as INSIG [9]. The forward primer was designed
from a genomic region 119 bp upstream from the locus
where the 5' end of SmAE C601385.1 is mapped; the
genomic sequence can be found in Supercontig_0000071
of the S. mansoni genome draft sequence [11] publicly
available at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [26]. After
cloning and sequencing the RT-PCR product we obtained
the full-length SmINSIG message that contains 857 bases
and encodes a protein of 244 amino acids. The deduced
protein displays the described conserved domain of
INSIG proteins (IPR009904) and the characteristic six
transmembrane regions.
Figure 2A illustrates a multiple alignment of INSIGs from
different deuterostomes and SmINSIG, where the conserved domain is shown and the six transmembrane
regions are marked. BLASTP search against the nr database
at GenBank using SmINSIG as query resulted in a best
match to the zebrafish (Danio rerio) INSIG-1 ortholog
([GenBank: AAH45341.1]) with 49% identity and 68%
similarity over 144 amino acids. A Maximum Likelihood
tree was constructed (refer to the Methods section for
details) (Figure 2B), and suggests that SmINSIG diverged
before the gene duplication event responsible for emergence of the two vertebrate paralogs in zebrafish.

Real-time PCR experiments with tubulin as an internal
standard showed a higher expression in egg, miracidium
and cercarial stages when compared to schistosomulum
(p < 0.05). The free-living forms (cercaria and miracidium) exhibit higher expression when compared to the
forms that live inside the vertebrate host (schistosomulum and adult) (p < 0.05) (Figure 3A).
Despite previous studies showing induction of INSIG
gene expression by insulin in rat regenerating liver [27]
and the presence of genes encoding proteins with similarity to the human insulin receptor in schistosomes [9,28],
we found that exposure of S. mansoni adult worms to
exogenous recombinant human insulin peptide for 1 or 2
hours in vitro did not affect the expression of SmINSIG
measured by Real-time RT-PCR while affecting the expression of a number of non-related genes (data not shown).
Possible gene partners and targets of SmINSIG identified in
schistosomes
This work is the first published report of an INSIG
ortholog in a protostome invertebrate. We have searched
the S. mansoni and S. japonicum transcriptome datasets for
evidence of the genes described in vertebrates as targets of
INSIG, and also for the presence of homologs in the
mevalonate pathway. They are listed in Table 2 and are
discussed in detail below.

Schistosomes are described to be cholesterol auxotrophs
(unable to synthesize cholesterol) [29], suggesting that
SmINSIG might perform in S. mansoni some of the functions described in mammals for INSIGs, especially in the
mevalonate synthesis pathway (a precursor of cholesterol
as well as of non-sterol isoprenoids) and not in the later
steps of cholesterol synthesis. Accordingly, gene
sequences potentially encoding all enzymes of the mevalonate pathway described in the MetaCyc database [30]
were found either in S. mansoni or in S. japonicum public
datasets, indicating that this pathway is intact in schistosomes (Table 2).
Interestingly, INSIG-1 has been shown to play an essential
role in sterol-mediated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase (a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway) in cultured mammalian CHO cells [23]. Knockout mice have
been generated in which the INSIG-1 and INSIG-2 genes
are disrupted in the liver through recombination [31].
These mice have uncontrolled synthesis of fatty acids,
cholesterol and a marked increase in HMG-CoA reductase
protein, resulting from a decreased degradation of the
reductase in the absence of INSIGs [31]. HMG-CoA
reductase has an ortholog already characterized in S. mansoni [32] and its inhibition compromises egg production,
as well as the survival of early stages of the parasite [24].
In addition, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in schisto-

samples from egg, miracidium, cercaria, schistosomulum or adult and primers for SmINSIG. Relative fold change was calculated
by comparing the Ct value for each sample to Ct values for alpha-tubulin (internal standard). B: Real-time RT-PCR using
mRNA samples from male and female adult worms and primers for SmINSIG. Log2 (Fold change) was calculated for the ratio
between female and male expression values. *p < 0.05.

somes blocks egg production, which is induced by cholesterol precursors, such as mevalonate and farnesol; these
precursors can also reverse the mevinolin-induced inhibition of egg production [25]. When expression was compared between male and female adult worms, a 10-fold
higher expression of SmINSIG was found in females (Figure 3B). Egg production in female worms is a very efficient
process and a putative negative control exerted by SmINSIG could be part of a modulatory mechanism of mevalonate synthesis in order to tune it to the rate of egg
production. Miracidia and cercariae (larval forms) are

short-lived and highly specialized forms, and the high levels of SmINSIG (Figure 3A) and the resulting inhibition of
mevalonate synthesis in those stages when compared to
adults would be consistent with a more complex physiology of the latter.
A recent report showed that in mammalian cells a fraction
of INSIG-1 molecules are bound constitutively to a protein named gp78 or autocrine motility factor receptor
(also present in schistosomes, see Table 2) through binding of transmembrane domains of the two proteins [33].

Evidence indicates that this sterol-triggered reductase/
INSIG-1/gp78 complex is essential for ubiquitination and
degradation of the reductase [33]. Based on the presence
of orthologs in the S. mansoni transcriptome database, this
evolutionarily conserved complex could also occur in
schistosomes.
In line with the known S. mansoni auxotrophy for cholesterol, we could not identify either in the S. mansoni or in
the S. japonicum transcriptomes any of the enzymes specifically involved in cholesterol synthesis from mevalonate.
Interestingly, we found a S. mansoni EST with similarity to
a short partial segment of M. musculus SCAP ortholog
(Table 2); SCAP has been described in mammals as a
SREBP cleavage-activating protein [34]. However, we
found no gene fragments that would encode SCAP's putative partner SREBP, the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding
Protein involved in regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis
in mammalian cells. In the absence of any evident SREBP
or cholesterol synthesis enzymes it is likely that the putative protein with partial similarity to SCAP might have a
different role in S. mansoni.
Interfering with the mevalonate pathway in schistosomes
could be a promising novel drug target approach because
of the known adverse clinical consequences of eggs to the
patients and of the biological importance of egg deposition in the parasite's life cycle.
Vasohibin
Another gene from Group 2 that we have selected for further scrutiny is represented by S. mansoni Assembled EST
(SmAE) C605907.1. Its consensus sequence had good
(56%) similarity to vasohibin-like proteins (recently
named vasohibin 2).

Vasohibins constitute a recently described family of
endothelium-derived angiogenesis inhibitors in humans
[35,36]. The presence of a Vasohibin ortholog in schistosomes might suggest a potential angiogenesis inhibition
process in the host, mediated by schistosomes' molecules.
Complete sequencing of clone MA3-9999U-M294-F04U.B, the longest clone in SmAE cluster C605907.1,
showed a transcript with 975 bases (Figure 4A) that we
named SmVASL for S. mansoni Vasohibin-like gene.
BLASTP comparison to Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL showed the
best match (48% identity and 58% similarity over 90
amino acids) to vasohibin 2 ([Swissprot: Q86V25] or
FLJ12505 protein), a recently described human vasohibin-like protein [36]. The amino portion of SmVASL
deduced protein (starting at Leu4) did align to Leu142 of
human vasohibin 2, thus suggesting that SmVASL represented a partial sequence of the S. mansoni ortholog.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/407

To search for possible additional portions of SmVASL, the
sequence of the original clone was mapped to the draft
sequence of the S. mansoni genome [11]. We found that
SmVASL maps with splicing to Supercontig _0000046,
from base 1,255,010 to 1,259,701 (Figure 4A). In a
genomic region of ~2,000 bases upstream from the
SmVASL gene we found a sequence apparently encoding a
peptide that displays similarity to vasohibin-like proteins
(not shown). Next, we designed a forward and a reverse
primer based on the sequence of this region, as indicated
in Figure 4A (green arrows). These primers were used in a
RT-PCR reaction, which resulted in a complex profile of
amplification with one band of ~650 bp and a smear
between 750–900 bp (Figure 4C). No amplicon was
obtained in a parallel reaction without reverse transcription, to control for the absence of DNA contamination,
indicating that the diverse range of products (Figure 4C)
was derived from bona fide mRNA messages. This result
suggested multiple alternatively spliced forms at the 5'
end of full-length SmVASL.
The RT-PCR amplification products were cloned and
sequenced. A total of approximately 300 clones were
sequenced from both ends, disclosing fourteen different
isoforms (SmVASLv1-13, with two SmVASLv6 isoforms).
Mapping of these isoforms to the S. mansoni genomic
sequence confirmed that the different clones are a result of
alternative splicing (Figure 4A). Variation is caused by a
number of alternative splicing events, such as 5'-deletion,
exon skipping, and junction of two exons by intron retention. Two different lengths for the second exon were
observed: exon 2 with 79 bp for variants SmVASLv1, 2, 6a,
6b, 7, 10, 12 and 13; and exon 8 with 65 bp, resulting
from a 5'-deletion in exon 2, for SmVASLv3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and
11 (Figure 4A). The latter splicing form caused an early
stop, and the resulting isoforms encode a putative short
57 amino acid protein. The isoforms have different 3'UTR ends, which may be related to different stability of
the messages.
Exon skipping was observed in SmVASLv5, 7, 8, 11 and 12
(Figure 4A). Intron retention was detected in isoforms
SmVASLv1, 2, 4, 12 and 13, where exon 4 is the junction
of exons 10 and 11 (that are present for example in isoform 5). Intron retention was also detected in SmVASLv1,
4, 7, 9 and 11, where exon 3 is the junction of exons 6 and
7. Finally, the intron retention observed in SmVASLv3
results from junction of exons 6, 7, 10 and 11.
We have identified seven different polypeptides that are
encoded by these variants, representing different deduced
protein isoforms (Figure 4A). As noted earlier, isoforms
SmVASLv3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 11 encode the same 57 amino
acid protein. Due to the absence of a stop codon in the
SmVASLv6 sequence in the segment amplified by RT-PCR,

sequences, UTRs and introns are represented by thick, thin and dashed lines, respectively. We have colored and numbered the
different exons consecutively in an arbitrary way, in the order that each new exon splicing form appears in Figure 4A. Primers
that were used for the RT-PCR amplification and RACE experiments of SmVASL alternatively spliced forms are represented by
green and blue arrows, respectively. Deduced protein-coding ORFs of SmVASL message are represented by thick colored
lines, and the lengths of the deduced encoded proteins are displayed at the right side of each splice variant. The asterisks next
to SmVASLv6, SmVASLv6a and SmVASLv6b indicate that the latter two are the result of a 3'-RACE-PCR experiment (3'-RACE
primers represented by blue arrows); B: Local alignment (BLAST) showing the conserved region of SmVASLv6a and human
vasohibin 2; C: Agarose gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products from a reaction performed with primers indicated in panel A

template, and PCR was subsequently performed. No RT indicates a negative control where PCR was performed with an RNA
sample incubated with poly-dT but no reverse transcriptase, to control for the absence of genomic DNA contamination.

a 3'-RACE experiment was conducted to extend
SmVASLv6 sequence, which resulted in two additional
longer
SmVASLv6
isoforms,
SmVASLv6a
and
SmVASLv6b. The longer isoform, SmVASLv6a encodes a
337 amino acid protein, the longest protein isoform
detected here. When compared through BLASTP with the
Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL database, the highest match was a protein of S. japonicum of unknown function ([Swissprot:
Q5DB91]). The second best match was to human vasohibin-like protein (vasohibin 2, [Swissprot: Q86V25])
(Figure 4B) to which SmVASLv6a protein aligns with 37%
identity and 57% similarity over 252 amino acids (71%
coverage of the human protein). Alignment of
SmVASLv6a and human vasohibin 2 reveals a C-terminal
divergence between these two proteins (Figure 4B). 5'RACE experiments under several conditions were performed, without success. A multiple sequence alignment
and a phylogenetic tree of SmVASLv6a and several other
orthologs are represented in Figure 5A and 5B, respectively.
Interestingly, several alternatively spliced isoforms are
predicted for human vasohibin 2 ([Swissprot: Q86V25]),
some of them encoding a shorter protein that lacks the
carboxyl-terminal end. Similarly, all SmVASL but
SmVASLv6a and SmVASL6b isoforms encode shorter proteins, lacking different portions of the carboxyl-terminal
end. Absence of the C-terminal end has been also
described for one of the isoforms of vasohibin 1, where
the shorter isoform abolishes the anti-angiogenic activity
of the full-length protein [35]. Conservation of such a
mechanism for generation of short isoforms lacking the
carboxyl-terminal region of the protein in distantly
related species such as H. sapiens and S. mansoni indicates
that the C-terminal portion of vasohibin should represent
a conserved functional domain.
Real-time PCR experiments using primers designed to
detect most of the isoforms (except isoform 3), shows that
cercaria and adult have the highest SmVASL expression
levels, whereas schistosomulum has the lowest SmVASL
levels (Figure 5C). Considering the angiogenesis control
role exerted by vasohibin in vertebrates and the high conservation level between SmVASL and human vasohibin,
together with vascular location of adult schistosomes, it is
tempting to hypothesize a role of SmVASL in modulating
human angiogenesis. Considering the presence of a vasohibin homolog in planarian (Additional file 2) and the
high SmVASL expression in miracidium, the S. mansoni
life form that invades the snail (an invertebrate host that
has an open circulatory system), we speculate that this
protein could perform a different (possibly endogenous)
role in this life stage. Loeffler et al. [37] reported that
schistosomes exert a positive effect on angiogenesis
because soluble egg antigen (SEA) induces angiogenesis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/407

related processes by up-regulating VEGF in human
endothelial cells [37]. It is hypothesized that neovascularization in the schistosome granuloma may be necessary to
maintain oxygen and nutrient levels, in a similar way as in
rapidly growing tumors [37,38]. Negative regulation of
host angiogenesis may be provided by the S. mansoni well
conserved vasohibin ortholog identified here, which
would counterbalance the previously reported positive
effects of S. mansoni on angiogenesis [37], thus helping to
maintain host hemostasis. Functional experiments are
warranted to determine the biological roles of the
SmVASL isoforms reported here.
Interferon Regulatory factor
The third and final gene analyzed in the present study
encodes an Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) protein
(represented by SmAE C603512.1 and named SmIRF).

IRFs are important molecules involved in immune
response and a schistosome ortholog could be related to
the recognition and response to host immune processes.
Primers were designed from the extremities of this assembled sequence and a single 1330 bp amplicon was generated by RT-PCR; cloning and sequencing confirmed its
identity. In addition, a 3'-RACE with primers designed
from SmAE C603512.1 permitted cloning and sequencing
of the 3' end of this mRNA. SmIRF full-length sequence
has 2297 bp and encodes a 476 amino acid protein that
shares 27% identity and 44% similarity over 434 amino
acids with the interferon regulatory factor 4 of Gallus gallus
([GenBank: AAK08198]) [see Additional file 3]. A multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree of SmIRF
and several other orthologs are represented in Figure 6A
and 6B, respectively. Each IRF contains a well-conserved
DNA-binding domain with ~120 amino acids at the
amino terminus that folds into a helix-turn-helix DNAbinding motif (Smart SM00348). The C-terminal end of
IRFs is generally more variable among family members
[39] and contains a SMAD/FHA domain, commonly
found in transcription factors and responsible for interaction with other phosphorylated molecules [40]. In silico
analysis of SmIRF using NetPhos [41] revealed the presence of several serine phosphorylation sites [Additional
file 3]; in mammalians, IRF phosphorylation is important
for its function and regulation [42].
IRFs constitute a complex family of transcription factors
with broad functionality in mammalians, which was
recently reviewed [43]. Honda and Taniguchi [43]
pointed to several mammalian genes regulated by IRFs
and we have searched for orthologs of these targets in S.
mansoni. Two genes regulated by IRFs (TAP1 and LMP2),
involved in processing and transport of peptides appear to
have homologs in schistosomes. Using human TAP1 gene
encoded protein as query we found in S. mansoni an ABC

transporter gene, SMDR1 [GenBank: AAA66476.1] (35%
identity and 61% coverage) that has been previously
described as possible transporter of peptides [44]. When
using human LMP2 ([GenBank: CAA60784]) as query, we
found a schistosome ortholog in our database
(C602473.1, with 55% identity and 88% coverage).
Human LMP2 encodes a proteasome subunit and replaces
the Y subunit in the proteasome structure upon IFN signaling and this change results in a different proteasome
proteolytic activity [45]. Functional proteasomes were
recently shown to be essential for schistosome development in the vertebrate host [46]. IRFs also regulate cas-

pase-1 expression [43]. We found a caspase in S. mansoni
that has higher similarity with caspase-3 than with caspase-1 (44% identity and 85% coverage); in mammalians
both caspases are involved with apoptosis control; however, the apoptosis pathway appears to be incomplete in
the parasite [9].
Besides the inherent capacity of IRFs to function as transcription factors, they selectively bind to a group of proteins, namely immunophilins. Interaction between IRF-4
and immunophilin FKBP52 in mammalians results in a
conformational change, abolishing DNA-binding activity

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:407

and partial IRF-4 proteolysis [47]. One immunophilin
named p50 [GenBank: AAA69867.1] was already identified in schistosomes, having a high similarity with vertebrate FKBP immunophilins [48,49].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/407

we believe the genes discussed here have characteristics
that make them good candidates for further investigation
as potential drug targets.

Methods
The IRF interactions are highly complex and not fully elucidated, even in mammalians, with new interactions and
functionalities being recently reported [43]. In this work
we have pointed to the existence in schistosomes of some
possible players. Other experiments (e.g. protein-protein
interaction) are warranted to identify functions and other
possible SmIRF interaction partners. It would be interesting to demonstrate if SmIRF is involved in schistosome
stress responses (viral infections, for example), or in hostparasite interaction, being part of the pathway that interplays with host immune molecules.

Conclusion
According to our analysis, the S. mansoni genes described
in this work are homologs of genes present in Deuterostomia, but absent in Ecdysozoa organisms. Given the specific functions of these genes in Deuterostomia, especially
in mammals, we envisage the possibility of co-optation of
the schistosome ortholog in interaction and adaptation to
the host environment. The evolutionary history leading to
conservation of such set of genes in these two distantly
related groups is not totally clear yet; more sequence
information from organisms of related phyla (especially
from other Lophotrocozoa) should help throw light on
this problem. The three genes characterized in detail in
this work might be involved in mevalonate synthesis (egg
production), angiogenesis control (host invasion) and
immune response (interplay with host defense molecules).
In S. mediterranea the orthologs of these genes may perform ancestral non-parasitic roles. In this respect, a recent
report [50] revealed the presence of orthologs of thyroid
hormone receptor (TR) in S. mansoni, S. japonicum and S.
mediterranea and demonstrated that TRs in platyhelminths are highly conserved not only in sequence similarity, but also in gene organization, protein-protein
interaction and in DNA-binding ability [50]; TR was previously believed to be an innovation of chordates as the
genomes of insects and nematodes do not contain TR
genes. Although the functions of TRs in invertebrates are
not fully understood, phylogenetic analysis showed that
the TR ortholog likely originated from a common ancestor of the Bilateria [50]. Both the results of Wu et al. [50]
and ours suggest the presence in a common ancestor of
genes previously thought to have arisen only later in evolution. We hypothesize that during Schistosoma evolution
the three genes discussed in the present report might have
been co-opted to perform functions that are crucial for the
parasite-host interplay. Regardless of the actual history,

Datasets
S. mansoni EST sequences generated by our group [9] were
used as the query dataset of S. mansoni sequences in this
work. Local BLAST [51] databases were formatted with all
the sequences available from arthropods, nematodes and
deuterostomes in the non redundant (nr) nucleotide section of GenBank database (updated as of May/2007) and
were used as subject in BLAST searches. In addition, all the
publicly available nucleotide sequences from non model
arthropods, nematodes and from the planarian S. mediterranea were used. The planarian dataset we used is composed of all the publicly available 171,483 nucleotide
sequences (97,901 CoreNucleotide and 73,582 ESTs, on
May 2007) together with the assembled ESTs obtained by
a large scale EST sequencing project [12]. The planarian
dataset was further supplemented with the EST assembly
data provided by the authors (10,485 assembled
sequences; 6,488 contigs and 3,997 singlets) [12]. In
order to reduce the EST sequence redundancy and consequently the time complexity of the process, the sequences
were processed using CD-HIT [52] prior to database formatting. After identifying the S. mansoni genes of interest,
we have considered their downstream effectors described
in the literature for vertebrates and we searched for the
presence of orthologs which could act as molecular partners or members of downstream pathways in S. mansoni.
When any of these orthologs were missing in the S. mansoni GenBank database the S. japonicum sequences were
alternatively searched.

The S. mansoni genome sequence partial assembly (v. 3) at
the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [26] was used.
Similarity searches
We used the BLASTX and TBLASTX programs [51] to
search for S. mansoni (a platyhelminth) translated
sequences that have considerable similarity to proteins
and translated ESTs from deuterostomes, nematodes and
arthropods. Perl scripts together with the Zerg parser [53]
and BioPerl [54] were used to perform and process BLAST
searches.

BLAST alignments with bit scores higher than 100 and
lower than 50 were considered as true matches and nonsignificant hits, respectively. Bit scores were used to facilitate cross-database comparisons. Hits with intermediary
bit scores (between 50 and 100) were manually inspected,
basically to eliminate hits derived from unmasked low
complexity regions where matches occur through a single

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:407

amino acid at repeated intervals. Overall, the sequences
included in Additional File 2 have scores higher than 80.
The S. mansoni genes without matches and Schistosoma
specific genes were filtered out. The resulting genes were
further assigned to one of the following groups (Table 1
and Additional file 1) when a given gene was detected in
at least one species belonging to the corresponding clade:
(1) present in S. mansoni, deuterostomes, arthropods and
nematodes (all groups); (2) present in S. mansoni and
deuterostomes, but not in arthropods and nematodes; (3)
present in S. mansoni and arthropods, but not in deuterostomes and nematodes; (4) present in S. mansoni and nematodes, but not in arthropods and deuterostomes); (5)
present in S. mansoni, arthropods and nematodes, but not
in deuterostomes; (6) present in S. mansoni, arthropods
and deuterostomes, but not in nematodes; (7) present in
S. mansoni, nematodes and deuterostomes, but not in
arthropods.
To evaluate the significance of the gene gains/losses under
each hypothesis, we have generated 100,000 bootstrapped samples and performed the Wilcoxon test. Simulations and the significance test were performed in the R
environment.
TMHMM [55] and MINNOU [56] were used to predict
transmembrane domains, NetPhos [41] to identify possible phosphorylation sites, with SignalP 3.0 [57] to predict
signal peptides, and with InterProScan [58] to predict
conserved domains.
Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple Sequence Alignments in the paper were generated using MUSCLE [59] and edited using JalView [60].
Curated alignments were then used to generate Maximum
Likelihood phylogenetic trees with PhyML package [61].
Significance of the results was estimated by building 1000
bootstrapped trees. The NEWICK files generated by
PhyML were then displayed with MEGA [62] producing
the trees displayed in the results section.
Cloning procedures
mRNA was obtained from adult parasites conserved in
RNALater (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) by extraction of tissue with MACs mRNA isolation kits (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). 200 ng of mRNA were treated
with 5 U of RQ1 RNAse-free DNAse (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) for 30 min at 37°C. Reverse transcription was
performed with oligo dT primers using the protocol of
Superscript first strand system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was performed with Advantage
II (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with the buffer
supplied by the manufacturer, and 200 nM of each specific primer using the following cycling program: 95°C for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/407

1 min plus 35 cycles each at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s,
and 68°C for 3 min, followed by a final extension at 68°C
for 3 min. The products were analyzed in 1.2% agarose gel
and cloned in pGEM-T vector (Promega) for further
sequencing. Primers are listed in Additional file 4.
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
mRNA was obtained from adult parasites conserved in
RNALater (Ambion) by extraction of tissue with MACs
mRNA isolation kits (Miltenyi Biotec). 200 ng of mRNA
was used for reverse transcription using the protocol of
the 3'RACE system kit for rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (Invitrogen) and specific primers. To perform 3'
RACE of vasohibin gene, 3 µg of total RNA from miracidium was used. Reverse transcription was performed using
1 µl of Super Scrip III (Invitrogen) at 65°C for 5 min,
55°C for 50 min and 85°C for 5 min.

PCR reaction was performed with Advantage II polymerase (BD Biosciences) with buffer supplied by the manufacturer, 200 µM dNTPs and 200 nM of each primer using
the following cycling program: 95°C for 1 min plus 35
cycles each at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 68°C for 3
min, followed by a final extension at 68°C for 3 min. The
products were analyzed in 1.2% agarose gel and cloned in
pGem-T vector (Promega) for further sequencing. Primers
are listed in Additional file 4.
Real-time RT-PCR procedures
mRNA was obtained from male or female adult parasites
conserved in RNALater (Ambion) by extraction of tissue
with MACs mRNA isolation kits (Miltenyi Biotec). 200 ng
of mRNA were treated with RQ1 RNAse-free DNAse
(Promega), using 1 U in 10 µl of reaction, for 30 min at
37°C. The DNAse was inactivated at 65°C for 10 min.

Three micrograms of total RNA from each of five stages
was treated with RQ1 RNAse-free DNAse (Promega),
using 4 U in 10 µl of reaction, for 1 hour at 37°C. The
resulting products were reverse transcribed with random
hexamer primers using the protocol of Superscript first
strand system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Control reactions
without addition of reverse transcriptase were run in parallel, and were used as templates for PCR negative control,
to control for the absence of possible DNA contaminants.
Primers for real-time RT-PCR (listed in Additional file 4)
were designed using the Primer Express program version
2.0.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with
default parameters. Real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and the specific primers in a GenAmp 5700
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). P-value
was calculated using Student's t-test with 95% confidence
interval.
