Abstract
The study of somatic DNA instabilities constitutes a debatable topic because different causes can
lead to seeming DNA alteration patterns between different cells or tissues from the same
individual. Carcinogenesis or the action of a particular toxic could generate such patterns, and this
is in fact the leitmotif of a number of studies on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) instability. Patterns
of seeming instabilities could also arise from technical errors at any stage of the analysis (DNA
extraction, amplification, mutation screening/sequencing, and documentation). Specifically,
inadvertent DNA contamination or sample mixing would yield mosaic variation that could be
erroneously interpreted as real mutation differences (instabilities) between tissues from the same
individual. From the very beginning, mtDNA studies comparing cancerous to non-cancerous tissues
have suffered from such mosaic results. We demonstrate here that the phylogenetic linkage of
whole arrays of mtDNA mutations provides strong evidence of artificial recombination in previous
studies on buccal cells and oral squamous cell carcinoma.

Background
Mitochondrial DNA analysis of different tissues and cells
from an individual is often carried out in order to learn
more about the distribution of some minor variation (heteroplasmy) of mtDNA molecules within an organism and
about spontaneous somatic mutations that could play a
role in carcinogenesis, in particular. Such analysis is, more
often than generally believed, beset with problems related
to the quality of mtDNA samples, DNA extraction, PCR
and sequencing protocols, and the omnipresent risk of
contamination and documentation errors [1-8]. A careful
design of experiments and optimal laboratory conditions

will prevent most of the potential artifacts before they
occur, but there can never be a full guarantee that the performed mutation screening eventually represents authentic variation. Data analysis of the fully documented
screening and sequencing results should therefore be
employed a posteriori, by using all available database and
phylogenetic information [9,10]. A previous study [11] on
mtDNA alterations in oral squamous cell carcinoma and
a most recent study [12] on mtDNA abnormalities in buccal cells of smokers then do not seem to be exempt from
the notorious problems of sample mixing and contamination.

The rationale for an a posteriori analysis is that mitochondrial genomes evolve along a phylogeny (genealogical
tree) and are highly polymorphic. This high polymorphism is only in part due to a minority of extreme hotspot
mutations (such as polyC-tract length polymorphisms)
but is mainly generated by blocks of inherited mutations
that are not reshuffled by recombination as in the case of
the diploid autosomal genome. Since many mutations
occur only very few times in parallel along the global
mtDNA phylogeny, a combination of several such inherited mutations locates a sample in the phylogeny in a
unique way, rendering it extremely unlikely that a complex mutational pattern could have arisen de novo. This
allows the researcher who has the necessary knowledge
about natural mtDNA variation to question mtDNA
sequencing results.

Methods
We tab into the standard databases in the field, namely
MITOMAP [13] and mtDB [14]. In addition, we perform
Google searches of the kind described in [15,16]. This
directly leads to entire coding-region haplotypes or control-region haplotypes stored in GenBank and discussed
in the Web by commercial genetic ancestry companies or
their clients.

tion profiles compared to the worldwide database of published mtDNA sequences. The information that is given in
the two tables concerns only the nucleotide differences
between the two sequences from each pair of analyzed tissues.
The first table then provides the contrasting variation for
the portion 4527–4954 of the ND2 gene. Assuming that
the patients had West Eurasian matrilineal ancestries, we
first take a look at the basal part of the corresponding
mtDNA phylogeny by focussing on the classified parts as
reflected in Figure 1 of Palanichamy et al. [17]. Then only
seven mutations within that short fragment highlight haplogroups that were well described before 2005; see our
Figure 1. Alternatively, one can search the mtDB database
for variation within this fragment and consider, say, the
top twelve most frequently recorded variants. Among
those, there are seven that predominantly are of East Asian
provenance and thus not relevant here. Then the five
remaining frequent variants are A4529T, G4580A,
A4769G, A4793G, and A4917G, which are – not incidentally – all signifying basal haplogroups in Europe (Figure
1). The fact that these variants are frequently stored in the

To put the recorded mutations or haplotypes into phylogenetic context, knowledge about the continental mtDNA
phylogenies is drawn from various publications [17-20].
Mutational hotspots with positional mutation rates well
above the rate averaged over the entire molecule are readily identified by aggregating the macro-haplogroup trees
and counting the recurrent changes at each site; see [21]
and Table 4 of [22]. Numbering of mutations and polymorphisms along the mtDNA genome are referred to the
revised Cambridge Reference Sequence, rCRS [23].

Results
Oral squamous cell carcinoma
Prior et al. [11] extracted mtDNA from 30 paired samples
of tumour and non-tumour tissue, which was analyzed for
contrasting variation within the two short fragments
4527–4954 and 30–407. These ranges constitute the putatively readable parts of the amplicons, excluding the
primer locations, although it is not clear from their article
whether the entire ranges and both strands were in fact
analyzed and well readable from start to end. Note that
the analysis of both strands and re-sequencing of the same
DNA extracts and amplicons do not prevent artificial
recombination due to e.g. sample mix-up; only separate
and individual extractions from the same individual
could provide the minimum guaranties [4]. The observed
paired mtDNA sequences were unfortunately not reported
in Prior et al. [11], so that no a posteriori check is possible
with respect to the potential completeness of the muta-

database does not mean that they are mutational
hotspots, but rather reflects the inheritance of the corresponding mutational variant in European matrilines. For
instance, no position in the region 4527–4954 would
qualify as a mutational hotspot with more than three
mutations in the mtDNA tree of Kivisild et al. [21].

We conclude that virtually all the mtDNA alterations
recorded in the study of Prior et al. [11] can be perfectly
explained by sample mixing and contamination. The
observed pattern itself is incompatible with features of a
natural mutational process that would never change
linked complex arrays of point mutations back and forth.

The nucleotide variant located in this DNA fragment that
is by far most frequently found in Europe is the nucleotide
inherited from the transition A4917G characterizing haplogroup T, which has frequency ~10% across Europe. Next
in frequency (~5%) comes G4580A in West Europe, characteristic of haplogroup V. Now, if one would randomly
permute paired identical sequences, that is, deliberately
generate mosaic assignments, then the typical sequence
contrast would involve position 4917 and to a lesser
extent 4580 and finally positions 4529, 4769, and 4793.
Now, the variation recorded in Table 1 of [11] mirrors
exactly such hypothetical sample mixing: four events at
4917, which could reflect perfect sample crossover (since
two changes are A to G and two are G to A), whereas one
event is at 4580 and another one at 4769! Thus, it is very
unlikely that the recorded haplotypic variation presents
authentic somatic variation, which would be expected to
hit positions from the entire fragment randomly, and not
just affect those few that signify major European haplogroups.

Buccal cells
The study by Tan et al. [12] reported numerous mtDNA
alterations in buccal cells from smokers versus non-smokers. The tables in this paper display only the cumulated
differences between mtDNAs in lymphocytes and in buccal cells within the cohort of smokers and that of nonsmokers, respectively, but do not provide the information
about the set of alterations (haplotypes) in every single
individual. Such haplotype information is usually necessary for critical reading and interpretation of the experimental results since it directly hints at potential artifacts.
In this case, however, the surprisingly large number of
seeming homoplasmic somatic changes, although just
cumulatively listed in their Table 3, is quite telling because
a number of mutations are known to occur together on
pathways of the mtDNA phylogeny.

The fragment 30–407, which encompasses the so-called
second hypervariable segment of the control region, harbours a number of extreme mutational hotspots. The topmost changes are the transitions at positions 146, 150,
152, 195, and the length polymorphism of the C stretch
preceding position 310, which is often found in heteroplasmic state in individuals, healthy or not. This entails
that transitional changes at positions 146, 150, 152, and
195 can be found in almost all combinations (haplotypes) among samples from the general population. In
contrast, relatively rare changes are, for instance, the transversion C186A and the transitions C186T, A240G, C285T,
and C295T, where the latter two variants are excellent
markers for haplogroups U1 and J, respectively.
The salient feature of the changes recorded in Table 2 of
Prior et al. [11] is that whole arrays of mutations (such as
the motif T146C-T152C-C186A), involving several hypervariable as well as single stable sites, switch back and
forth. Such a concerted mutational process has never been
observed in mtDNA population studies other than in
cases of artificial recombination of amplicons [6,24]. One
can, for instance, interpret the mtDNA alterations in
Patient 10 as the result of sample mix between a genuine
haplogroup V mtDNA (testified by G4580A, and carrying
a rare private change A240G) and a haplogroup J1c
sequence (indicated by G228A and C295T).

Specifically, the nine mutations at sites 10086, 10373,
10398, 13105, 15824, 15944del, 16223, 16278, and
16362 unambiguously determine a haplogroup L3b1 lineage α, the seven mutations at 10115, 10530, 10398,
13590, 13650, 16223, and 16278 signify a particular
mtDNA lineage β belonging to haplogroup L2c [21], and
the five mutations at 4529, 10034, 10238, 10398, and
16223 indicate a lineage γ of haplogroup I status. The
presence of these lineages in the samples analyzed by Tan
et al. [12] (see their Table 3) gives a strong signature of
contamination or sample mix-up. Indeed, among 2704
entire coding region sequences stored in the mtDB [14],
T10115C exactly identifies the 61 haplogroup L2
sequences, A4529T the 33 haplogroup I sequences, and
A15824G the 17 haplogroup L3b sequences – without
exception. These mutations are thus excellent haplogroup
markers on their own. The fact that even 3–5 additional
coding region mutations (plus further mutations from the
more variable control region) come in support of the
respective haplogroup profile renders the haplogroup signature bullet-proof.
In addition, one could further postulate the presence of a
particular haplogroup T2b lineage δ bearing the four
mutations at 930, 9947, 13563, and 16294 [25], although
none of the mutations alone would be characteristic of
this lineage. In fact, G9947A would also enter the motif of
haplogroup F3b and C13653T that of haplogroup G2.
With respect to the amplicon range "Dloop1" (16100–
16544, including primer locations) [26], the four mutations at A16220C, A16265G, T16298C, and T16362C

BMC Cancer 2009, 9:113

point to a specific lineage ε belonging to haplogroup F3b
that thrives in Taiwan [27], whereas the mutation pair for
C16256T, C16270T testifies to a frequent European lineage ζ from haplogroup U5a. Since the former mutations
are reflected in the mtDNA from buccal cells and the latter
mutations in the mtDNA from lymphocytes, the presence
of these six mutations could be explained by a single sample-mixing event in the laboratory: contamination of the
buccal sample ζ with the buccal sample ε at the amplification step for the "Dloop1" fragment. The cartoon of Figure
2 thus reconstructs a possible scenario that could explain
this contamination event.
Given the amplicon ranges [26] and the frequencies of the
changes observed, one can attempt to provide a most parsimonious explanation of the mutational pattern. Besides
the "Dloop1" amplicon, the long amplicon "GR" (9827–
10629) covers several mutations from lineages α, β, γ, and
δ. The amplicon "ND5.2" (12949–13738) covers mutations from lineages α, β, and δ. Three further amplicons
then cover 930, 4529, 15884 and 15944del, respectively.
This means that a few amplicons have been drawn from
the wrong lineages in at least four cases (assuming the
simplest scenario that the order of the nucleotides at
10034 and 13105 should rather be reversed in that table).
The precise recombination events are impossible to reconstruct unambiguously in the absence of haplotype information but the signal for artificial recombination is
beyond doubt. Moreover, we cannot assume that all distinguishing mutations were actually recorded, since it has
been stated that TTGE can detect many but not all mutations [28]. The expected percentage of missed mutations
in the case of mtDNA does not seem to have been determined systematically. Therefore the full amount of contamination and falsely assigned amplicons may be larger
here, especially with amplicons that are distinguished
only by a single mutation.
The pattern of lineage mixing that nonetheless emerges
from our Figure 3 gets indirect support from Table 1 of
Tan et al. [12] in that the most dramatic amount of altogether 40 differences is clustered in just 8 of the 42 smokers. This, however, does not imply that 1–3 mtDNA
alterations between matched samples would not be suspicious. For instance, the alterations other than A2444C
recorded for the non-smokers could all signify the contrast between haplogroup L2 and other lineages. The
number of wrongly assigned amplicons in the nonsmoker group likely did not exceed one per individual.
An artifactual status of the findings in Tan et al. [12] is also
reflected by the extremely uneven distribution of seeming
mtDNA alterations across the different amplicons, which
is a typical feature of mixing up different mtDNA lineages
at some but not all amplification steps. Another ampli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/9/113

con-specific feature is the seeming length variation of
homopolymeric A or C tracts, which was recorded only for
the amplicon "SD" (7234–7921), although several other
notorious tracts exist elsewhere in the molecule.

Conclusion
Neither of the two studies published in the journal Carcinogenesis which we have reassessed here can provide
any convincing indication of an increased amount of
somatic point mutations in smokers or cancerous tissues,
since the reported variation shows the typical imprint of
mosaicism of amplicons caused by inadvertent contamination and sample confusion
Once a problematic mtDNA study is published, the
authors of the study and the reader are in very unequal
positions: Whereas the former possess the samples and
know all the data on which the article was built, the
unconvinced reader who has to make do with the meagre
portion of the data that is revealed in the article can only
base his arguments on reconstructed haplotypic data (as
in the two cases that we have re-examined here).
Artifactual patterns differ from the natural ones in that
they usually mirror basal parts of the mtDNA phylogeny
whence they can easily be detected by comparison with
published mtDNA classification trees [29]. In contrast, the
natural instabilities are expected to result from a stochastic mutation process that randomly hits nucleotide positions along the mtDNA molecule and does not just run
down and climb up the mtDNA phylogeny. On the other
hand, one cannot a priori preclude the possibility that
some damage may exist in the form of an elevated amount
of large deletions in mtDNAs of exposed cells. However,
results would always come under suspicion of experimental error and thus warrant revision whenever single
exposed tissues or tumoral samples showed an atypical
pattern of (seeming) instabilities. It is then not only the
kind of mutation involved (whether highly or lowly
mutable), but also the combination of these mutations in
haplotypes and, moreover, the multiple appearance of
such 'yin-yang' haplotypes (sensu e.g. [30,31]) in several
individuals, as in the case of Prior et al. [11], that render
the results highly dubious.
A study on brain tumors that compared matched cancerous/non-cancerous tissues and was executed under forensic sequencing conditions [3,32] did not find any
remarkable mtDNA alterations: the vast majority of
changes in the two hypervariable segments of the control
region concerned the homopolymeric C tract, and in no
case among 69 patients was more than one substitution
found [33]. A similar pattern can also be seen in the study
on esophageal cancer by Tan et al. [34] (which was duplicated from [35]): in the entire mtDNA of 20 matched

chances for TTGE to detect a mutation prior to sequencing. Further note that a good quality electropherogram is
no guarantee of an authentic result: when samples are
mixed up initially, one can observe perfect sequencing
patterns (bands) just showing (seeming) heteroplasmies
at those unmatched positions between the two mixed
haplotypes. Finally, any discrepancy between the results
for two amplicons that indicated a mutated position in
one but not the other amplicon would definitely need resequencing. In case there are no mutations in the overlap
regions of an amplicon with its two neighbouring amplicons, then a strict association of the yin-yang pattern with
different amplicons gives a strong signal for sample crossover [29]. Since samples may arrive in the laboratory in
problematic state [1], it would be wise to follow some
guidelines usually exercised in the field of ancient DNA; in
particular, one should perform a critical consideration of
all available information and answer the question "Is
there any reason to not believe the results or conclusions?" [37].

In their paper 'Contamination and sample mix-up can
best explain some patterns of mtDNA instabilities in buccal cells and oral squamous cell carcinoma' Bandelt and
Salas have assessed the authenticity of somatic mtDNA
mutations observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC) reported by Prior et al [11]. The phylogenetic
approach used by Bandelt and Salas utilizes publicly available mtDNA sequence data to evaluate whether reported
somatic mutations are nothing more than polymorphisms occurring between different mtDNA haplotypes
that co-exist due to sample mix-up. In previous publications Bandelt and Salas have quite rightly called into question the reporting and authenticity of mtDNA mutations
and even suggested 'rules' on error detection and quality
control [4,38-40]. We strongly applaud these efforts and
thoroughly agree that journals should employ strict rules
on provision of sequence data by submitting authors as
well as guidelines for journal reviewers.

pairs of samples (analyzed with TTGE) there were only
five singular changes found other than instabilities of that
homopolymeric C tract.
In order to minimize the risk of contamination or sample
confusion going undetected it is advisable to use at least
twice the number (32) of primer pairs for amplification
that was employed by Tan et al. [12]. Every nucleotide
position should thereby be covered by at least two distinct
amplicons, a requirement that e.g. forensic scientists
should ideally meet [36]. This would also enhance the

Bandelt and Salas have demonstrated use of their phylogenetic approach in a previous study of mtDNA mutations in different tumour types [4]. In that a posteriori
study of sequence data derived from many samples they
were able to highlight a number of mutations that were
not somatic as originally reported, but simply polymorphisms between haplotypes occurring in the sample after
a likely sample mix-up. We were mindful of the guidelines
and problems previously highlighted by Bandelt and Salas

when reporting the results from our study on mtDNA
mutations in OSCC. PCR products were sequenced multiple times (in both directions) and only consistent mutations described. When we submitted our manuscript to
Carcinogenesis one of the reviewers instructed that, before
mutations could be authenticated, PCR products would
have to be generated using high fidelity PCR to minimize
the likelihood of error. Thus, despite having already replicated PCR and sequencing a number of times for each
sample we had to confirm our results by repeating this
process once more and further submit this data. The second reviewer demanded that we 'repeat PCR and sequencing of all positive samples independently to exclude the
possibility of contamination'. Thus, the mutations we
reported were done so with a high degree of confidence
and we can clearly state that Carcinogenesis demonstrated
a high degree of caution prior to acceptance of our results.

In our study of OSCC cases six patients (out of thirty)
individually showed a single base substitution between
tumour and normal tissue within a 473 bp region of the
ND2 gene. These mutations were observed at three nucleotides: 4580 (1 patient), 4769 (1 patient) and 4197 (4
patients). The frequencies of these mutations and pattern,
according to Bandelt and Salas, reflect a hypothetical sample mixing. They conclude that 'it is very unlikely that the
recorded haplotypic variation presents authentic somatic
variation, which would be expected to hit positions from
the entire fragment randomly'. This is a conclusion drawn
on only a single nucleotide per sample and an assumption
that the nucleotide target specificity of mutagens is surprisingly random. Bandelt and Salas go on to conclude
that somatic mutations observed in the D-Loop of OSCC
in our study are also due to sample mixing and that mutation patterns observed at nucleotides 146, 152 and 186
are incompatible with features of a 'natural mutational
process'. We are intrigued as to what the natural mutational process may be in oral epithelial cells of cigarette
smokers. They go on to state that 'the natural instabilities
are expected to result from a stochastic mutation process
that randomly hits nucleotide positions along the mtDNA
molecule...'. If we adopt this rationale then we will always
discard those legitimate somatic mutations that occur at
polymorphic sites (it is ironic too that polymorphic sites
are actually markers of mutation events sometime in the
past).
We are surprised that we are expected to believe that
mtDNA somatic mutations would be found at random
positions in the genome particularly when the genome of
a smoker is exposed to constituents of cigarette smoke.
Cigarette smoke contains over 4000 chemicals [41] many
of which are known to be mutagenic. There are literally
thousands of publications for mutagenicity assays highlighting the fact that mutagens cause base substitutions
which do not appear randomly in a target gene but demonstrate sequence specificity. As an example we consider
the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogen
(±)
anti-7β,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo [a]pyrene (BPDE) found in cigarette smoke that
preferentially targets CG dinucleotides (unmethylated
and methylated) at a high rate in the supF gene using the
supF mutational assay [42]. There is also a strong correlation between BPDE adduct sites and mutation hotspots in
the TP53 gene in lung cancer [43]. A search of the literature would reveal that many other mutagens specifically
display other types of sequence context. The exposure of
mtDNA to mutagens from cigarette smoke could thus
result in a non-random mutation spectrum. The non-ran-

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Cancer 2009, 9:113

dom pattern of mutations occurring in tandem at nucleotides 146 and 152 in a number of samples from our
study is quite plausible. Tandem mutation events are
common in mutagen-induced mutation spectra from
mutagenicity assays. Interestingly, tandem mutations
have been observed at nucleotides 146 and 152 when
comparing a lung cancer cell line with a matched B-lymphoblastoid cell line [40].
Given that we suggested that mutation hotspots in our
study were occurring in the OSCC tumours we can understand why Bandelt and Salas raised concerns about a
'switch back and forth' for mutations at 146 and 152.
However, it is unknown as to whether mutations observed
by us at 146 and 152 in OSCC actually occurred in the
tumour or non-tumour tissue for each patient examined.
Thus, it is unknown whether a switching in this sense has
actually occurred. This could be confirmed by sequencing
PCR products from a third tissue per case. In all probability we were wrong to conclude that the 146 and 152 mutations are potential biomarkers for OSCC but they may
well prove to be useful biomarkers for smoking related
DNA damage.
In the reassessment of our data using their phylogenetic
linkage approach Bandelt and Salas state that they provide
a 'strong evidence of artificial recombination' and that virtually all the mtDNA alterations can be explained by sample mixing and contamination. It is interesting that the
logic applied by Bandelt and Salas means that any single
somatic mutation occurring at a nucleotide that is polymorphic between different haplotypes can simply be
explained by sample mixing. In other words, by just
applying the phylogenetic approach to studies involving
few mtDNA mutations in such a small region of genome,
you can never provide proof of contamination but just
make inference. We fully respect the opinions of both
authors and support their quest for accurate procedure
and reporting. However, to make accusations in the literature of results generated due to contamination without
presenting any conclusive evidence is unwarranted and
thankfully not acceptable by most journals. We question
how anybody can draw such conclusions based on tiny
pieces of data lacking empirical evidence and statistical
support and, seemingly, a lack of understanding of mutagen associated sequence context. Reviewers at journals
should insist on reasonable use of the phylogenetic
approach applied by Bandelt and Salas in addition to the
rules that these authors suggest.
