Abstract
Background: Laribacter hongkongensis is a Gram-negative, sea gull-shaped rod associated with communityacquired gastroenteritis. The bacterium has been found in diverse freshwater environments including fish, frogs
and drinking water reservoirs. Using the complete genome sequence data of L. hongkongensis, we performed a
comprehensive analysis of putative transport-related genes and genes related to chemotaxis, motility and quorum
sensing, which may help the bacterium adapt to the changing environments and combat harmful substances.
Results: A genome-wide analysis using Transport Classification Database TCDB, similarity and keyword searches
revealed the presence of a large diversity of transporters (n = 457) and genes related to chemotaxis (n = 52) and
flagellar biosynthesis (n = 40) in the L. hongkongensis genome. The transporters included those from all seven
major transporter categories, which may allow the uptake of essential nutrients or ions, and extrusion of metabolic
end products and hazardous substances. L. hongkongensis is unique among closely related members of
Neisseriaceae family in possessing higher number of proteins related to transport of ammonium, urea and
dicarboxylate, which may reflect the importance of nitrogen and dicarboxylate metabolism in this assacharolytic
bacterium. Structural modeling of two C4-dicarboxylate transporters showed that they possessed similar structures
to the determined structures of other DctP-TRAP transporters, with one having an unusual disulfide bond. Diverse
mechanisms for iron transport, including hemin transporters for iron acquisition from host proteins, were also
identified. In addition to the chemotaxis and flagella-related genes, the L. hongkongensis genome also contained
two copies of qseB/qseC homologues of the AI-3 quorum sensing system.
Conclusions: The large number of diverse transporters and genes involved in chemotaxis, motility and quorum
sensing suggested that the bacterium may utilize a complex system to adapt to different environments. Structural
modeling will provide useful insights on the transporters in L. hongkongensis.

Background
Laribacter hongkongensis is a Gram-negative, sea gullshaped, rod that belongs to the Neisseriaceae family of
b-proteobacteria [1,2]. The bacterium was first isolated
from the blood and empyema pus of a man with alcoholic cirrhosis and bacteremic empyema thoracis in
Hong Kong [1]. Using the selective medium, cefoperazone MacConkey agar, the bacterium was subsequently
isolated from the stool of patients with gastroenteritis
[3,4]. In a multicenter case-control study, L. hongkongensis was shown to be associated with community-acquired

gastroenteritis, with recent travel and eating fish being
risk factors [5]. Apart from the human gut, L. hongkongensis has also been isolated from gut of freshwater animals including fish and Chinese tiger frogs as well as
water from drinking water reservoirs [2,5-9]. In order to
adapt to the changing environments and intestines of different animal hosts including human, fish and amphibians, L. hongkongensis must possess mechanisms to
combat harmful substances in the environment and
immune defense of animal hosts.
Transport-related proteins of bacteria are important in
allowing the uptake of essential nutrients or ions, and
extrusion of metabolic end products and hazardous substances. Bacteria employ different mechanisms for transport of different chemicals and these mechanisms have

been classified into seven major categories according to
the Transport Protein Database (TCDB): channels and
pores (class 1), electrochemical potential-driven transporters (class 2), primary active transporters (class 3), group
translocators (class 4), transmembrane electron carriers
(class 5), accessory factors involved in transport (class 8),
and incompletely characterized transport systems (class 9).
Bacteria also possess sophisticated signaling systems to
sense and adapt to various substances in the environment. Depending on whether the environmental substances are attractants or repellents, the bacterium may
migrate towards or away from the substances, which
include certain amino acids, sugars, and metal ions
[10-12]. This sense-and-swim ability is important for
bacteria to be able to find the suitable environment for
optimal growth. Chemotaxis involves two separate systems, the chemoreceptors located in the bacterial cell
membrane which are important for sensing the binding
compounds, and the transduction proteins which are
involved in the downstream signal transduction in
response to the stimuli. The chemoreceptors are also
called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs),
which are reversibly methylated and function as homodimers [11,13].
The availability of the complete genome sequence of
L. hongkongensis has allowed an opportunity to study its
biology and important factors for adaptation to the changing environment [14]. We have previously found that
transport-related proteins, including all seven major categories of transporters, account for about 14.1% of all coding sequences in the L. hongkongensis genome, suggesting
that this group of proteins may be important for survival
of the bacterium in the various environments and hosts
[14]. Genes related to motility and chemotaxis were also
identified [14]. Except for the first strain isolated from
blood culture and empyema pus of a patient which was
likely a non-motile variant, all strains from patients with
gastroenteritis, animals or environmental water samples
are motile with polar flagellae [1,4-7,10], suggesting
that chemotaxis and motility may be an important
mechanism for environmental adaptation in most isolates
of L. hongkongensis. In this study, a comprehensive analysis
of putative transport-related genes and genes related
to chemotaxis, motility and quorum sensing in the
L. hongkongensis genome is performed.

Results and discussion
Transport genes in L. hongkongensis genome

A huge diversity of transporters, including those from all
seven major categories, were identified in the L. hongkongensis genome, as described in our previous complete genome report [14]. This may reflect its ability to adapt to
various environments, including freshwater animals, water
and human intestines. These transporters included: (1) 48

Page 2 of 17

channels and pores, (2) 134 electrochemical potentialdriven transporters, (3) 194 primary active transporters,
(4) 9 group translocators, (5) 16 transmembrane electron
carriers, (6) 7 accessory factors involved in transport and
(7) 49 transporters of incompletely characterized transport
systems (Table 1).
Channels and pores

The outer membranes of lipid bilayer envelopes of
Gram-negative bacteria contain large numbers of waterfilled transmembrane protein channels known as porins
[15]. They serve as a molecular filter allowing for permeation of hydrophilic molecules up to a certain size or
specific solutes into the periplasmic space. Some bacterial porins also serve as receptor for phage and bacteriocin binding [16]. X-ray crystoallography studies and
atomic structures have revealed that porin molecules
exists as trimers, with the transmembrane core composed of mostly b-sheets and some a-helixes [15]. The
L. hongkongensis genome contained 48 coding sequences
(CDSs) belonging to channels and pores, of which 17
were a-type channels, 29 were b-barrel porins and 2
were holins (Table 1).
Among the 17 a-type channels, five were mechanosensitive channels, including one large conductance mechanosensitive channel (LHK_02562) and four small
conductance mechanosensitive channels (LHK_01830,
LHK_01942, LHK_02394 and LHK_02965), which are
responsible for mediating resistance to mechanophysical
changes [17]. Interestingly, three CDSs encoding proteins
of the ammonium transporter family were identified in the
L. hongkongensis genome, as compared to only one copy
such genes in Chromobacterium violaceum, the most closely related bacterial species of the Neisseriaceae family
with complete genome sequence available (Table 2).
Moreover, a homologue of urea transporter responsible
for urea uptake (LHK_01044) was also present in L. hongkongensis (Table 2), while this protein was absent in
C. violaceum and the pathogenic Neisseria spp., Neisseria
gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis. This may reflect
the importance of nitrogen metabolism of the bacterium,
as L. hongkongensis is assacharolytic and has been shown
to use different pathways for arginine synthesis regulated
at different temperatures [14]. In fact, the habitats of the
closely related bacterial species are quite different from
that of L. hongkongensis, where the latter can survive in
human intestine in addition to diverse freshwater environment. This may also explain its unique ability in maximizing nitrogen metabolism. Among the b-barrel porins, the
OmpA-OmpF-type porins are most well known in bacteria to allow passive diffusion of hydrophilic substrates
across the outer membrane. Three CDSs coding for putative OmpA-OmpF-type porins were identified in the
L. hongkongensis genome. Interestingly, two homologues
of another b-barrel porin, fatty acid transporter gene

showing that L-malate can be used as its sole carbon
source [14].
Six of the 11 porters for dicarboxylate transport found in
L. hongkongensis genome were believed to form two DctPtype tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP)
transporters which belong a heterogeneous group of substrate-binding protein (SBP)-dependent secondary transporters of a diverse range of substrates found in bacteria
and archaea [23-25]. The genes encoding the 3 subunits
were arranged in an operon, with two membrane proteins
DctQ and DctM associating with DctP to form a C4-dicarboxylate TRAP transporter [26]. Several TRAP transporters have been characterized in detail, with the structures
of at least seven DctP-type SBP subunits determined [25].
These studies revealed significant structural and architectural similarities among the different SBPs, while highlighting the differences that permitted these proteins to
bind their respective substrates with high affinity and specificity. Besides substrate recognition, it was also found
that the SBP performs other essential functions [27], and
likely interacts with the integral membrane components in
a hitherto undiscovered manner. One operon
(LHK_00983-00984-00985), encoding C4-dicarboxylate
transporter, was found downstream of several genes
related to allantoin regulation and utilization; while the
other operon (LHK_01394-01393-01392) was located
upstream of the maeB gene encoding NADP-dependent
malate dehydrogenase. The SBP encoded by LHK_00983
(DctP_00983) was a 331 aa protein containing a 22 aa Nterminal signal peptide, with a predicted molecular weight
of 33.9 kDa. It possessed 48% amino acid identity to the
closest homolog in Roseovarius sp. TM1035 (NCBI accession no.: ZP_01881277). The SBP encoded by LHK_01394
(DctP_01394) was a 335 aa protein containing a 24 aa Nterminal signal peptide, with a predicted molecular weight
of 34.3 kDa. It possessed 74% amino acid identity to the
closest homolog in C. violaceum ATCC12472. The homology model and structural alignment of the homology
model showed that the overall structure of DctP_00983
and DctP_01394 was very similar to the determined structures of other DctP-type SBPs (Figure 1 and 2, and see
Supplementary material). Similar to other DctP homologs,
they were divided into two domains with conserved
arrangements of a-helices and b-sheets, which are

(fadL), were also found, which may be important for
uptake of long-chain fatty acids in freshwater environments poor in lipids or fatty acids.
Electrochemical potential-driven transporters

The L. hongkongensis genome possessed a large number of
CDSs (n = 134) encoding for putative electrochemical
potential-driven transporters, among which the majority
(132 CDSs) were porters including uniporters, symporters
and antiporters, while the remaining two CDSs were iongradient-driven energizers (Table 1). Of the 132 porters,
19 (14.3%) belonged to the major facilitator superfamily
(MFS). MFS proteins are important transporters in bacteria, which allow transport of molecules by an electrochemical ion gradient and typically contain a single subunit
with 12 membrane-spanning helixes [18]. The MFS proteins of L. hongkongensis were predicted to mediate transport of diverse substrates including ions, drugs and
metabolites. Another major family of porters were the
resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily (28
CDSs), which are responsible for transporting a wide variety of substrates including antibiotics, dyes, detergents,
fatty acids, bile salts, organic solvents, heavy metals, autoinducers and lipooligosaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria [19,20]. Other porters belonged to diverse families of
proteins which facilitate the transport of diverse substances including ions, amino acids, drugs, heavy metal
such as nickel and cobalt, nucleobase, C4-dicarboxylates
and other metabolites. The presence of various porters
may be involved in acquisition of essential substances for
metabolism and bacterial resistance to environmental
toxic substances including heavy metals. Interestingly, a
total of 11 porters for dicarboxylate transport were found
in L. hongkongensis genome, as compared to only 6 in
C. violaceum and 1 each in N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae genomes (Table 3). C4-dicarboxylates are intermediates in TCA cycle that can be utilized by bacteria as
nonfermentable carbon and/or energy sources under aerobic or anaerobic conditions [21]. Some C4-dicarboxylates,
such as succinate, oxalate and malate, can also be found in
nature [22]. The presence of high number of C4-dicarboxylates transporters may reflect the ability of using
C4-dicarboxylates as carbon sources in L. hongkongensis,
as the bacterium is assacharolytic, lacking a complete glycolytic pathway, and is in line with our experiments

in L. hongkongensis. For DctP_00983, the C-score of the model was 1.49, which approximately corresponded to an expected TM-score of 0.92
± 0.06 and an expected root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.2 ± 2.3 Å from the native structure. The Ramachandran plot showed that 99.6%
of aa are in the favored and allowed regions. Calculated G-factors for dihedral angles and main-chain covalent forces are 0.11 and -0.17
respectively, with an overall average of 0.01. The Z-score of the model is -7.84, which is comparable to other experimentally determined protein
chains of a similar size in the PDB. Local model quality analysis by plot of residue scores in ProSA-web did not reveal any problematic regions in
the structure. The quality analysis results suggested that the homology model is mostly reliable with good structural qualities. For DctP_01394,
the C-score of the model was 1.36, which approximately corresponded to an expected TM-score of 0.90 ± 0.06 and an expected RMSD of 3.5 ±

for dihedral angles and main-chain covalent forces are 0.09 and -0.17 respectively, with an overall average of 0.00. The Z-score of the model is
-8.15, which is comparable to other experimentally determined protein chains of a similar size in the PDB. Local model quality analysis by plot of

also found in the closest homolog in Roseovarius sp.
TM1035, but absent from other related DctP-type SBP
homologs including DctP_01394.
Primary active transporters

Primary active transporters mediate energy-driven transport of substances in and out of bacterial cells by using
ATP hydrolysis, photon absorption, electron flow, substrate decarboxylation, or methyl transfer [29]. Primary
active transporters were the most abundant class of
transporters (194 CDSs), constituting 6% of CDSs in the
L. hongkongensis genome, among which 150 belonged to
P-P-bond-hydrolysis-driven transporters (Table 1). Of
the 150 P-P-bond-hydrolysis-driven transporters, 109
were ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters which are
one of the largest groups of membrane proteins using
energy from ATP hydrolysis for transport. In bacteria,
they reside in the inner membrane and are involved in
both uptake and export of a wide range of substances. All
ABC transporters share a common basic structure which
consists of four domains: two transmembrane domains,
typically with six transmembrane spans per domain, and
two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains which catalyse nucleotide hydrolysis [30]. In bacteria, these domains
are encoded as separate polypeptides. Determined by the
structure of the transmembrane domain, ABC transporters are typically specific for the substrates that they are
responsible for, although some may transport for multiple related substances. As a result, the numbers of ABC
transporters in different bacterial species vary widely,
depending on its need for adaptation to varying environmental conditions [31]. The ABC transporters in the
L. hongkongensis are likely involved in the active transport of diverse substances, including carbohydrate, amino
acids or peptides, ions, vitamins, lipids, drugs and heavy
metals including molybdenum, iron, zinc, cobalt, magnesium, copper, cadmium, mercury, lead, arsenite and
nickel. These systems were often arranged in gene clusters comprising the ATP-binding protein and two auxiliary proteins, a permease and a substrate-binding protein.
Compared to the 70 ABC transporters found in E. coli
[31], the L. hongkongensis genome contained a large
number of such proteins, reflecting its ability to adapt to
different hosts and environment.
Apart from P-P-bond-hydrolysis-driven transporters,
other primary active transporters identified in the
L. hongkongensis genome included oxidoreduction-driven transporters (39 CDSs) and decarboxylation-driven
transporters (5 CDSs), which use chemical energy to
perform transport of charged or uncharged molecules
across the membrane against the concentration gradient
[32].

Group translocators

Of the nine group translocators, two were phosphotransfer-driven group translocators and seven were acyl CoA
ligase-coupled transporters belonging to the fatty acid
transporter (FAT) family. The phosphotransferase group
translocators are components of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS), which catalyzes translocation of
sugars and hexitols with concomitant phosporylation, and
regulates the metabolism in response to the availability of
carbohydrates. PTSs consist of two cytoplasmic proteins,
enzyme I (EI) and HPr, and a variable number of sugarspecific transport complexes (Enzymes IIsugar) belonging to
the group translocators. While the Escherichia coli genome
encoded 38 different PTS proteins, the L. hongkongensis
genome encoded only one gene for EI and HPr each and
two genes for transporters, one containing protein-N pphosphohistidine-sugar phosphotransferase IIA domain
and the other containing nitrogen-regulatory fructosespecific IIA domain [33]. This is likely related to the relative unimportance of sugar metabolism in L. hongkongensis.
Transmembrane electron carriers

There were 16 transmembrane electron carriers in the
L. hongkongensis genome, including 14 transmembrane
2- and two transmembrane 1-electron transfer carriers.
Among the 14 transmembrane 2-electron transfer carriers, 12 belonged to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing oxidoreductase (PMO) family, and the other 2
belonged to the disulfide bond oxidoreductase D (DsbD)
and B (DsbB) family respectively.
Accessory factors involved in transport

There were seven accessory factors belonging to auxiliary transport proteins in the L. hongkongensis genome, 3
belonging to the membrane fusion protein (MFP) family,
2 to the phosphotransferase system enzyme I (EI) family,
1 to the phosphotransferase system HPr (HPr) family
and 1 to the stomatin/podocin/band 7/nephrosis.2/
SPFH (stomatin) family.
Incompletely characterized transport systems

Of the 49 CDSs belonging to incompletely characterized
transport system, 15 were recognized transporters of
unknown biochemical mechanism, with 6 belonging to the
putative type VI symbiosis/virulence secretory pathway
(VISP) family, 2 to the HlyC/CorC (HCC) family, 2 to the
capsular polysaccharide exporter (CPS-E) family, 1 to the
tellurium ion resistance (TerC) family and the remaining 4
being metal ion transporters. The other 34 CDSs were
putative transport proteins, including 2 CDSs of the camphor resistance (CrcB) family and 1 probable hemolysin
III.
Iron Transport in L. hongkongensis

Iron is an essential metal for most microorganisms used in
many key molecules involved in metabolism. In bacteria,

Lau et al. Cell & Bioscience 2011, 1:28
http://www.cellandbioscience.com/content/1/1/28

iron metabolism has been shown to be important in adaptation to the environment especially within the host and
as a result related to virulence. Diverse mechanisms for
iron transport were identified in the L. hongkongensis genome, suggesting that the bacterium is able to adapt to iron
limitation present in human body which represents one of
the non-specific immune response called induced hypoferremia [34,35]
Siderophores and iron uptake

Siderophores are low molecular mass compounds with
high affinity for ferric iron. In contrast to C. violaceum
which produced siderophores for iron acquisition, proteins related to siderophore production were not found
in L. hongkongensis genome. However, a homolog of
TonB-dependent siderophore receptor (LHK_00497) was
present, as described in our previous report [14].
Although Listeria monocytogenes also did not produce
siderophores for iron acquisition, it was able to obtain
iron by using either exogenous siderophores produced by
various microorganisms or natural catechol compounds
widespread in the environment [36,37]. It remains to be
determined if L. hongkongensis can utilize exogenous
siderophores or other natural iron-binding compounds
for iron acquisition.
Hemin transport

Despite the inability to produce siderophores, a set of
genes related to the transport of hemin were identified in
L. hongkongensis genome (8 CDSs compared to 6 CDSs
in C. violaceum). The 8 CDSs included TonB-dependent
receptor (LHK_01193), hemin degrading factor (LHK_
01192), ABC transporter permease (LHK_01189), ferric
citrate transport system ATP-binding protein (LHK_
01188), hemin-binding periplasmic protein (LHK_01190),
hemin importer ATP-binding subunit (LHK_01427),
hemin ABC transporter permease protein (LHK_01428)
and Fur family ferric uptake regulator (LHK_01431). The
conserved domains for hemin receptor, FRAP and
NPNL, were also identified in the TonB-dependent
receptor [38]. This suggests that L. hongkongensis is able
to utilize iron source form host proteins, which may be
important for survival in its hosts. Three other CDSs,
homologous to fbpA (LHK_02634), fbpB (LHK_02635)
and ATP-binding protein (LHK_02636), ABC transporters for transferrin and lactoferrin, were also present,
although the outer membrane receptor is not found.
ABC transporters of the metal type

A cluster of three genes encoding an ABC transporter of
the metal type (homologous to that identified in C. violaceum) was identified in the L. hongkongensis genome.
They encoded a periplasmic Mn2+/Zn2+-binding (lipo)protein (surface adhesion A) (znuA), a Mn2+/Zn2+ permease
component (znuB) and the ATPase component (znuC). In
addition, a gene encoding a putative cadmium-translocating ATPase component (cadmium-translocating P-type

Page 7 of 17

ATPase) (CadA) (LHK_00449) was also present. A similar
gene was also found in C. violaceum (CV1154), which was
thought to be a surface adhesion A component for Mn2
+
/Zn2+ binding. The Fur family ferric uptake regulator
(zur) (LHK_01344) was also present.
Other transporters

In addition to the above transporters, two CDSs encoding ferrous iron transport proteins, feoA (LHK_03044)
and feoB (LHK_03045), were identified in L. hongkongensis genome, which are believed to provide iron supply under anaerobic or low pH conditions in bacteria
[39]. Three other CDSs homologous to iron uptake
ABC transporter periplasmic solute-binding protein
(LHK_01590), ABC transporter permease (LHK_01593)
and ABC transporter ATP-binding protein (LHK_01591)
were also found.
Iron storage

Mechanism required for storage of iron after its acquisition from the environment was present in L. hongkongensis, which mainly depends on two proteins: bacterioferritin
(BFR) (LHK_01239, homologous to CV3399 in C. violaceum) and frataxin-like homolog (LHK_00023, homologous to Daro_0208 in Dechloromonas aromatica). The
BFR is an iron-storage protein with close similarity to the
ferritins found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes [40].
The frataxin-like homolog has been implicated in iron storage in other bacteria. The frataxin-like domain is related
to frataxin, the protein mutated in Friedreich’s ataxia
which is therefore proposed to result from decreased
mitochondrial iron storage [41,42].
Regulation of iron transport

Fur protein is a global repressor protein by forming FurFe2+ complexes that bind to iron-dependent promoter
during iron-rich conditions. It regulates ferrichrome
(fhuABCDG), ferric citrate (fecABCDE) and ferrous iron
(feoABC) uptake systems. The Fur protein in L. hongkongensis was encoded in CDS LHK_01431 (homologous to
FuraDRAFT_2340 in Lutiella nitroferrum).
Chemotaxis in L. hongkongensis
Methyl-accepting chemotaxis and chemosensory transducer
proteins

A total of 52 open reading frames (CDSs) were related to
chemotaxis, of which 29 encoded MCPs and 22 were chemosensory transducer proteins. Most genes encoding
MCPs were scattered throughout the L. hongkongensis
genome, while the genes encoding transducer proteins
were mostly arranged in three gene clusters as described
in our previous report (Table 4) [14].
All the predicted MCPs in L. hongkongensis possessed
a transmembrane domain, which is compatible with
their anticipated location in the bacterial cell membrane
and function as receptors. Conserved domain structures
were also identified in some of the MCPs. The plasmid

a

The Che proteins were encoded in three gene clusters, named CA, CB and CC (chemotaxis A, B and C clusters)

achromobacter secretion (PAS) domain was found in
four MCPs (LHK_00564, LHK_00726, LHK_02158 and
LHK_02814). PAS domains are energy-sensing modules
that are found in proteins from archaea to humans [43].
The histidine kinase adenylyl cyclase MCP and phosphatase (HAMP) domain was present in 22 of the 29 MCPs.
The HAMP domain interacts with the PAS domain for
signal transduction in aerotaxis (oxygen-sensing) receptor in Escherichia coli [43], and possesses roles of regulating the phosphorylation or methylation of homodimeric
receptors by transmitting the conformational changes in
periplasmic ligand-binding domains to cytoplasmic signaling kinase and methyl-acceptor domains [44].
These chemosensory transducer proteins work as twocomponent regulatory systems which typically consist of
a sensory histidine kinase and a response regulator. The
histidine kinase is usually a transmembrane receptor and
the response regulator a cytoplasmic protein [45]. Following autophosphorylation at a conserved histidine residue in response to changes in chemoreceptor occupancy,
the histidine kinase serves as a phospho-donor for the
response regulator. Once phosphorylated, the response
regulator mediates changes in gene expression or cell
motility. CheA is a typical sensory histidine kinase while
CheY is a downstream regulator protein [46]. Upon
phosphorylation, CheY binds to the FliM component at
the base of the flagellar motor switch to induce clockwise
rotation [47]. In contrast to the single copies of CheA
and CheY in E. coli, the presence of 22 chemosensory
transducer proteins, many with multiple copies including
three CheA, one CheB, one CheD, two CheR, five CheV,
one CheW, four CheY, and two CheZ, suggested that
L. hongkongensis may utilize a complex transducer system
to mediate chemotaxis response and adapt to environmental changes (Table 4). These Che proteins were
encoded in three gene clusters, named CA, CB and CC.
The first and largest cluster, CA, encoded two CheA, one

CheR, two CheY, two CheV, one CheZ, and the single
CheD and CheW. The second and smallest cluster, CB,
encoded one CheV and CheY. The third cluster, CC,
encoded one CheA, one CheY, two CheV and one CheZ.
Phylogenetic analysis of CheAs, CheVs and CheYs of L.
hongkongensis suggested that the multiple copies are the
result of both horizontal transfer events and gene duplication, as some of the copies were more closely related to
the corresponding proteins in other bacteria while others
were more closely related among the homologues of L.
hongkongensis (Figure 3).
The CheA proteins of L. hongkongensis were most closely related to homologues in the closely related Chromobacterium violaceum and Lutiella nitroferrum with
47% to 72% amino acid identities. CheA has five
domains, P1 to P5 [46]. All the three CheA proteins in
L. hongkongensis contained these conserved domains. In
the P1 domain, the invariant histidine residue, which
undergoes phosphorylation by the P4 domain, was also
present. In the kinase domain P4, the four conserved
regions designated the N, G1, F and G2 boxes were also
present in the three CheAs (Figure 4).
The CheY proteins of L. hongkongensis were highly similar to the homologues in C. violaceum and Dechloromonas
aromatica, with 70% to 83% amino acid identities. Multiple alignment of the four CheY with that of E. coli showed
the presence of all five amino acid residues conserved
among response regulators [46,48]: aspartate at positions
12, 13 and 57; threonine at position 87, and lysine at position 109, with the aspartate at position 57 representing the
phosphorylation site (Figure 5). Residues that interact with
P2 domain of CheA were identified.
Other Che proteins are believed to be involved in the
regulation of bacterial chemotaxis, although the exact
function of some are not fully understood. Among
them, CheB is known to work in conjunction with CheR
in the reversible methylation of the MCPs. CheR is a

the conserved glutamine residues of MCPs, while the
methylesterase CheB is responsible for demethylation
[49,50]. Similar to CheY, the CheB of L. hongkongensis

also contained the five conserved amino residues of
response regulators. In addition, three conserved residues of the catalytic site, serine at position 164, histidine
at position 190 and aspartate at position 286, and the

soil. On the other hand, the pathogenic Neisseria species,
Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitides, which
also belong to the same Neisseriaceae family, are nonmotile with humans being the only host and reservoir,
and do not possess flagellar genes.
A bacterial flagellum is typically composed of three
parts, the filament formed by flagellin subunits, basal
body attached to the bacterial cell membrane, and the
hook which links between the filament and basal body
[53]. All the major proteins that form these flagellar components were present in the L. hongkongensis genome.
They included FliC and FliD which form the major part
of the filament; FlgE, FlgK and FlgL which form the hook
and hook-filament junction; and Flg B, FlgC, FlgH, FlgI,
FlhA, FlhB, FliF, FliG, FliH, FliI, FliM, FliN, FliO, FliP,
FliQ, FliR, MotA and MotB which form the basal body
and flagellar-motor complex. Putative regulators of these
flagellar proteins were also identified. FlgD and FliK are
regulators of the hook component FlgE. FlgA, FlgN (both
being chaperon proteins) and FliJ are involved in export
of flagellar components. The anti-sigma factor gene FlgM
and s28 FliA that regulates late gene products were also
present. However, similar to C. violaceum, the L. hongkongensis genome lacked the FlhDC operon genes, suggesting that the regulation of flagellar protein expression
is controlled by FlgM/FliA in this group of bacteria.
Quorum sensing in L. hongkongensis

In addition to chemotaxis through which bacteria can
rapidly adapt to environmental changes, quorum sensing
is another way to assess the environment and to recognize
the host. Quorum sensing is a signaling system through
which bacteria can communicate among themselves by
the production of and response to chemical signals called
autoinducers [54]. In response to the changing concentrations of these autoinducers, downstream gene expression
can be regulated. This cell-to-cell communication system,
first identified in Vibrio harveyi in the regulation of bioluminescence, is now known to exist in diverse bacteria,
especially those that reside in the gastrointestinal tract
where recognition of the host may be important for survival and virulence gene expression [54,55]. Among the
three major quorum-sensing mechanisms, including the
LuxR-I, LuxS/AI-2, and AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine
systems, known to be utilized by enteric bacteria, only the
latter was found in the L. hongkongensis genome, suggesting that this system played a major role in quorum-sensing
in the bacterium [14].
The AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine system is
involved in inter-kingdom cross-signaling and regulation
of virulence gene transcription and motility [54]. This
mechanism is best characterized in enterohemorrhagic
E. coli (EHEC) which causes fatal hemorrhagic colitis and
hemolytic uremic syndrome. It has been shown that the
locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), an important

Page 14 of 17

virulence factor in EHEC, and the flagellar genes of
EHEC are regulated by the AI-3 system which involves
AI-3 produced by the commensal gastrointestinal microflora and/or epinephrine/norepinephrine produced by
the host [56,57]. The AI-3 system has also been implicated in biofilm formation in enteropathogenic E. coli
(EPEC) [58]. Clarke et al. have recently identified the protein, QseC that binds to AI-3 and epinephrine/norepinephrine, suggesting its involvement in the AI-3 system
[59]. QseC belongs to a two-component system, QseB/C,
in which QseC is the sensor kinase and QseB the
response regulator. QseB/C has also been shown to be
involved in activation of the flagella regulon and virulence in a rabbit model for EHEC [59,60]. The L. hongkongensis genome contained two sets of genes,
LHK_00329/LHK_00328 and LHK_1812/LHK_1813,
homologous to qseB/qseC [14], most closely related to
homologues in C. violaceum and Azoarcus sp. strain
BH72 respectively. The two qseB genes in L. hongkongensis possessed the response regulator receiver domain
(PF00072) and the C-terminal domain of transcriptional
regulatory protein (PF00486) previously found in the
QseB of E. coli. The two qseC genes in L. hongkongensis
also contained the His Kinase A (phosphoacceptor)
domain (PF00512) and the histidine kinase-, DNA gyrase
B-, and HSP90-like ATPase domain (PF02518) previously
identified in the QseC of E. coli. The presence of two
copies of qseB/qseC suggested that the AI-3 system may
be an important mechanism for adaptation to the changing environment and animal hosts for L. hongkongensis.

Conclusions
A large number of diverse transporters (n = 457), including those from all seven major transporter categories,
were identified in the L. hongkongensis genome. A diversity of genes involved in chemotaxis, motility and
quorum sensing were also found. This suggested that the
ability to transport various substances plays an important
role in the physiology or survival of L. hongkongensis,
which may also utilize a complex system to mediate chemotaxis response and adapt to and survive in the rapidly
changing environments. In particular, the bacterium is
unique among closely related members of Neisseriaceae
family in possessing higher number of proteins related to
transport of ammonium, urea and dicarboxylate, which
may reflect the importance of nitrogen and dicarboxylate
metabolism in L. hongkogensis which is assacharolytic.
Structural modeling of two C4-dicarboxylate transporters
showed that they possessed similar structures to the
determined structures of other DctP-TRAP transporters,
but one with a rarely seen disulfide bond. A large number
of ABC transporters were also identified. These suggest
that the bacterium may be able to transport a wide variety of substrates including antibiotics, dyes, detergents,

Lau et al. Cell & Bioscience 2011, 1:28
http://www.cellandbioscience.com/content/1/1/28

fatty acids, bile salts, organic solvents, ions, amino acids,
drugs, heavy metals such as nickel and cobalt, nucleobase, C4-dicarboxylates and other metabolites. Diverse
mechanisms for iron transport, including hemin transporters for iron acquisition from host proteins, were
identified, suggesting that the bacterium may adapt to
iron limitation present in human host. Using blastp of all
transporters against rcsb pdb, many of these genes were
also found to have homolgous proteins of high sequence
identities with known structures (data not shown). The
large number of chemosensory transducer proteins,
many having multiple copies arisen from both horizontal
transfer events and gene duplications, may constitute a
complex transducer system for mediating chemotaxis
response and adapt to environmental changes. The presence of two copies of qseB/qseC homologs suggests that
L. hongkongensis may use the AI-3 system for cross-kingdom quorum-sensing and regulation of potential virulence factors. Further studies are required to better
characterize the precise target substance for transport
proteins of interest, and the targets regulated by qseB/
qseC in L. hongkongensis, which may shed light on its
potential mechanisms for pathogenicity. Structural modeling can be a useful tool to provide useful structural
insights about these genes in L. hongkongensis.

Methods
Transport genes were identified and classified according
to Transport Classification Database TCDB http://www.
tcdb.org/ and manual annotation. These CDSs were
from COG C (Energy production and conversion), COG
D (Cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning), COG E (Amino acid transport and metabolism), COG F (Nucleotide transport and metabolism),
COG G (Carbohydrate transport and metabolism), COG
H (Coenzyme transport and metabolism), COG I (Lipid
transport and metabolism), COG J (Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis), COG K (Transcription),
COG L (Replication, recombination and repair), COG
M (Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis), COG N
(Cell motility), COG O (post-translational modification,
protein turnover, chaperones), COG P (Inorganic ion
transport and metabolism), COG Q (Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism), COG R
(General function prediction only), COG S (Function
unknown), COG T (Signal transduction mechanisms),
COG U (Intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular
transport) and COG V (Defense mechanisms). CDSs
that were classified to COG N (cell motility) and COG
T (signal transduction mechanisms), and COG M (cell
wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis) were manually
annotated for identification of genes related to chemotaxis, motility and quorum sensing. CDSs from other
COGs were searched for additional genes using

Page 15 of 17

keywords: chemotaxis, che, MCP, flagellar etc. All putative genes were studied by manual curation based on
the BLASTx result or multiple alignments. Phylogenetic
relationships were determined using Clustal × version
1.81. Protein family analysis was performed using PFAM
[61]. Results were also compared to those of N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, C. violaceum, which were the
other bacterial species in the Neisseriaceae family with
complete genome sequences available, where appropriate [29,62-70]. Genes encoding TRAP transporters were
located and annotated as described above. Sequence
analysis for the presence of signal peptide and transmembrane domains were performed using SignalP v3.0
and TMHMM v2.0 servers respectively [71,72]. Identification of homologs in other bacteria was performed by
using BLASTP sequence similarity search against the nr
database in NCBI GenBank. The predicted sequences of
mature SBPs were submitted to the I-TASSER server for
homology modeling using default parameters and available structures of several DctP-type SBP homologs (PDB
code: 3B50, 2XA5, 3GYY, 3FXB, 2HPG, and 2CEY) as
templates [73]. If multiple homology models were
returned, then the best model was selected for further
analysis based on the C-score. Quality assessment of the
homology model was performed using PROCHECK [74]
and ProSA-web [75]. Presence and connectivity of disulfide bonds in the protein were predicted using the DiANNA v1.1 server [76]. Structural alignment of the
homology models of SBPs in L. hongkongensis and
related structures in Protein Data Bank (http://www.
pdb.org) was performed using the MatchMaker tool of
UCSF Chimera with selected structures (PDB code:
2HZK, 2CEY, 2VPN, 2PFZ, 2PFY, and 2ZZV) [77].
Molecular images were generated using UCSF Chimera.
