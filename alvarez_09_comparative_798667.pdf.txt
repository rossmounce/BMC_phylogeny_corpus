Abstract
Background: Cystine-knot (cys-knot) structure is found in a rather large number of secreted
proteins and glycoproteins belonging to the TGFbeta and glycoprotein hormone (GPH)
superfamilies, many of which are involved in endocrine control of reproduction. In these molecules,
the cys-knot is formed by a disulfide (SS) bridge penetrating a ring formed by 8, 9 or 10 amino-acid
residues among which four are cysteine residues forming two SS bridges. The glycoprotein
hormones Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Thyroid-Stimulating
Hormone (TSH) and Chorionic Gonadotropin (CG) are heterodimers consisting of non-covalently
associated alpha and beta subunits that possess cys-knots with 8-amino-acyl (8aa) rings. In order to
get better insight in the structural evolution of glycoprotein hormones, we examined the number
and organization of SS bridges in the sequences of human 8-aa-ring cys-knot proteins having 7
(gremlins), 9 (cerberus, DAN), 10 (GPA2, GPB5, GPHα) and 12 (GPHβ) cysteine residues in their
sequence.
Discussion: The comparison indicated that the common GPH-alpha subunit exhibits a SS bridge
organization ressembling that of DAN and GPA2 but possesses a unique bridge linking an additional
cysteine inside the ring to the most N-terminal cysteine residue. The specific GPHbeta subunits
also exhibit a SS bridge organization close to that of DAN but it has two additional C-terminal
cysteine residues which are involved in the formation of the "seat belt" fastened by a SS "buckle"
that ensures the stability of the heterodimeric structure of GPHs. GPA2 and GPB5 exhibit no cys
residue potentially involved in interchain SS bridge and GPB5 does not possess a sequence
homologous to that of the seatbelt in GPH β-subunits. GPA2 and GPB5 are thus not expected to
form a stable heterodimer at low concentration in circulation.
Summary: The 8-aa cys-knot proteins GPA2 and GPB5 are expected to form a heterodimer only
at concentrations above 0.1 microM: this would be consistent with a short-term paracrine role but
not with an endocrine role after dilution in circulation. Consequently, GPA2 and GPB5 could exert
separate endocrine roles either during development and/or during adult life of both vertebrates
and invertebrates.

Background
In cystine-knot (cys-knot) proteins, three disulfide (SS)
bonds are arranged in such a way that one SS bond passes
through the ring formed by two other SS bridges and the
interconnecting peptide backbone [1,2]. The six cysteine
residues forming three knotted SS bonds are numbered 1
to 6 from the N-terminus along the polypeptide sequence
of these proteins and the SS bridge arrangements are
always beween cys residues 1-4, 2-5 and 3-6 (figure 1).
Nevertheless, cystine knot proteins belong to two large
superfamilies named knottins [3,4] and cystine-knot
Growth Factor related proteins [5]. In knottins it is the 36 bridge that passes through the frame formed by the two
other SS bridges (1-4 and 2-5) whereas in cys-knot
Growth Factor related proteins, it is the 1-4 bridge that
passes through the frame formed by SS bridges (2-5 and
3-6) [3].
Cys-knot Growth Factor related proteins are secreted and
act as growth factors (TGFβ, PDGF), as morphogens
(BMPs, gremlins, DANs, Cerberus) and/or as hormones
(glycoprotein hormones: LH, FSH, CG, TSH). Structurally,
cys-knot Growth Factor related proteins have been classified, on the basis of phylogenetic analysis, as a function of

the number of amino acid residues forming the ring i.e. 8aa-, 9-aa- or 10-aa-ring [6]. Because of our interest in the
structure-function relationships of glycoprotein hormones that are cys-knot proteins with 8-aa-ring, we more
closely examined and compared the distribution of
cysteine residues along the amino acid sequences of all 8aa-ring cys-knot proteins. This comparison of the arrangements of cysteine residues and SS bridges in the amino
acid sequences of 8-aa-ring cys-knot proteins was initiated
in order to distinguish the specific structural features of
the GPA2 and GPB5 molecules compared to glycoprotein
hormones (GPH) subunits and to other 8aa-ring cys-knot
proteins. Indeed GPA2 and GPB5 genes have been identified by genome sequence analysis in human [7] and other
species [8] on the basis of their homology with GPH α
and β subunits respectively. Because of this it was
assumed that like GPH α and β subunits, GPA2 and GPB5
formed a heterodimer but this heterodimer was evidenced
by SDS-PAGE only after chemical crosslinking of coexpressed recombinant GPA2 and GPB5 with disuccinimidyl suberate [7]. In the present study, we compare the
arrangements of cysteine residues and SS bridges in GPA2,
GPB5, GPH α- and β-subunits as well as other 8-aa-ring
cys-knot proteins in order to support or to challenge the
hypothesis that GPA2 and GPB5 can form a heterodimer
in physiological situation.

Schematic view of the structure of 8-aa-ring cystine-knot
Schematic view of the structure of 8-aa-ring cystineknot proteins. The six cysteines belonging to the cystineknot are shown in yellow in this scheme and in the tables in
additional files 1, 2 and 3. The remaining 4 amino-acids
belonging to the 8-aa-ring are shown in green here as well as
in the tables. G stands for the glycine residue that is conserved in all 8-aa-rings of cys-knot proteins. The black and
yellow segments represent the three disulfide bridges forming the cystine-knot. The size of the ring is exagerated compared to that of the loops for the sake of clarity.

Phylogenetic analyses of cys-knot proteins show that the
8-aa-ring proteins are more closely related to each other
than to the 9-aa- and 10-aa ring subfamilies [6]. This gives
support to the division of cys-knot Growth Factor related
proteins into three subfamilies based on ring size and justifies the present analysis taking into account only 8-aa
ring cys-knot proteins. The comparison of the arrangements of cysteine residues and SS bridges in the amino
acid sequences of cys-knot proteins with 8-aa rings was
initiated in order to distinguish the specific structural features of the GPA2 and GPB5 molecules compared to glycoprotein hormones (GPH) and to other 8-aa-ring cysknot proteins.
Cys distribution in 8- aa-ring cys-knot protein sequences
The sequences of the 8-aa-ring cys-knot proteins were
retrieved from NCBI as indicated by Avsian-Kretchmer
and Hsueh [6] plus those for GPA2 and GPB5 that were
not considered in this previous study (hGPA2: NP
570125, hGPB5: NP 660154). The sequences of 8-aa-ring
cys-knot proteins were aligned and their cysteine arrangements were compared as previously [6] and they are
shown in the tables in additional files 1, 2 and 3.

The table in additional file 1 shows the comparison of
cysteine arrangements in human 8-aa-ring cystine-knot
proteins (see Additional file 1). The cysteine residues that

Page 2 of 6

Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2009, 7:90

form the cystine knot are numbered 1-6. Cysteine residues
not belonging to the knot structure are found in loops 1,
2 and 3 of most cys-knot proteins and are noted I, II and
III.
Cysteine residues 2, 3, 5, and 6 form the ring and are highlighted in pale yellow in additional file 1 and cysteine residues 1 and 4 form the knot (highlighted in darker
yellow). The cystine ring is formed by the sequences from
cys-2 to cys-3 and from cys-5 to cys-6 (non-cys residues
highlighted in green in additional file 1).
The 8-aa cystine-knot proteins are presented in see additional file 1 according to their respective total numbers of
cysteine residues. The hBMP-7 that like other BMPs possesses 7 cys residues, serves as the reference molecule since
its crystalographic 3D-structure has been determined [9].
BMP-7 has only one cysteine residues in addition to the
sixth residues forming the cystine-knot structure. This
unpaired cysteine residue, shown with grey background in
additional file 1, is believed to be involved in a symetrical
SS bridge in homodimers of BMPs.
Gremlins and cerberus molecules both have 9 cysteine
residues in their sequences. Therefore, they also have an
odd number of cysteine residues meaning that they also
have an unpaired cysteine inside their amino acid
sequence. Compared to the BMP sequence, the additionnal SS bond links cysteine residues noted I and III in additional file 1 and belonging to loops 1 and 3 respectively.
The same SS bridge I-III is conserved in DAN, GPA2 and
GPB5 which all have 10 cysteine residues in their
sequences. The previously unpaired residue cys II in loop
2 of BMP, Grem and Cer is found in DAN and GPA2 to be
linked to cys IV downstream of the ring in their C-terminal sequence. Consequently, in addition to the cystine
knot, there are two additional SS bridges, one linking
loops 1 and 3 and the other one linking loop 2 and C-terminus of these molecules with 10 cysteines. In GPB5, the
previously unpaired residue cys II in loop 2 is absent and
cys IV is not free but is bridged with an additional cys residue (cys V) only 7 aa downstream of it thus forming a
very short loop.
GPHα also has 10 cysteine residues but it does not possess
the SS bridge between cys I and cys III but instead exhibits
an original bridge between an additional cysteine residue
inside the 8-aa-ring that is linked to another additional
cysteine at the N-terminus of the molecule. This feature in
GPHα is unique among all 8-aa-ring cys-knot proteins. It
is also noteworthy that the disappearance of the bridge
between loops 1 and 3 in the GPHα subunit is paralleled
by a shortening of these two loops compared to those in
DAN, GPA2 and GPB5.

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/90

Human GPHβ chains possess 12 cysteine residues. Compared to GPB5, the two additional cys residues are located
in loop 1 and at the terminus end respectively. These two
cys residues have been shown to establish a bridge in hCG
[1,2] as well as in FSH [10] and most probably in all
GPHs. This bridge is known to be the "buckle" that fasten
the "seat belt" formed by the C-terminal end of GPHβ
subunits around their α-partners [11,12]. The cys IV-cys V
bridge found in GPB5 is still present and has been
described as a "tensioner" of the "seat belt" in GPHβ subunits [13,14].
Additional file 2 shows the arrangement of cysteines in
GPB5 sequences from various vertebrate and invertebrate
species compared to the human GPB5 that had been previously compared to the other 8aa-ring cys-knot proteins
in additional file 1. It shows a great conservation of the
general structure of these molecules throughout very distant species. Indeed, the distinctive features of hGPB5
compared to the other human 8-aa-ring knot-proteins
(No cys II, presence of cys IV and V, no cys S) are strictly
conserved in all vertebrate, ecdysozoan and lophotrochozoan species.
Additional file 3 shows the arrangement of cysteine residues in GPA2 sequences from various vertebrate and
invertebrate species compared to the human GPA2 that
had been previously compared to the other 8-aa-ring cysknot proteins in additional file 1. The specific arrangement found in hGPA2 permits to differentiate putative
GPA2 sequences in other species from other cys-knot proteins.
Dimerization of 8-aa-ring cys-knot proteins
The 8-aa-ring cys-knot proteins exhibit 7, 9, 10 or 12
cysteine residues in their sequences. The proteins with
odd numbers of cys residues (7 in BMP, 9 in Grem and
Cer) exhibit one residue that is not involved in an intrachain SS bridge (shaded in grey in additional file 1) and
which is suspected to establish an inter-chain SS bridge in
homodimers.

In contrast, all 8-aa-ring cys-knot proteins with even numbers of cysteines (10 in DAN, GPA2, GPB5 and GPHα 12
in LHβ, FSHβ, TSHβ and CGβ) exhibit no unpaired cys
residues and all of them are engaged in intra-chain SS
bridges. Therefore, these molecules with even numbers of
cysteines are not expected to form inter-chain SS bridges.
Indeed this has been clearly shown for the heterodimeric
glycoprotein hormones in which GPHα is non-covalently
combined with either LHβ, FSHβ, TSHβ or CGβ. The heterodimeric structure of GPHs has been shown to be stabilized by a "seatbelt" sequence. The "seatbelt" in GPHβ
subunits is "buckled" by a SS bridge between cysteine residues in the C-terminal region (cys110 in hCGβ) and one

Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2009, 7:90

in loop 1 (cys26 in hCGβ), both marked SB (seatbelt
buckle) in additional file 1.
These two cys residues are absent in the human GPB5
sequence (additional file 1) as well as in the GPB5
sequences of all other species (additional file 2). Therefore, no "seat belt" is expected in the GPB5 structure that
could stabilize its association with GPA2. Numerous
reports have stressed the importance of the seatbelt for
GPH subunits heterodimerization. Nevertheless, a paper
[15] published before the seatbelt structure was known
[1,2] reported that des (101-145)hCGβ subunit cotransfected with bovine α subunit formed a biologically active
heterodimer albeit at a lesser extent than the full-length βsubunit. The mutated des (101-145)hCGβ subunit lacks
all C-terminal amino-acids beyond cys100 forming the
seatbelt and has the same length as GPB5 (see. According
to this report [15] the seatbelt might not be indispensable
for GPH subunits heterodimerization and therefore GPA2
and GPB5 might combine in a heterodimer in spite of the
absence of a potential seatbelt sequence in GPB5. Nevertheless, numerous papers in the literature indicate that the
seatbelt and its fastening by a SS bridge are important for
the stability of GPH heterodimers when secreted and
diluted at very low concentrations. Indeed, when the cys
residues in the "seat belt" are mutated [16] or reduced
[17], a dramatic drop in heterodimer stability is observed.
Indeed, the Kd of heterodimerization of GPH α and β subunits is approximately 10-7-10-6 M [18,19] indicating that
the presence of αβ heterodimer in the circulation at concentrations as low as 10-11-10-9 M is possible only because
of the slow rate of GPH dissociation [17] compared to
their high rate of elimination [20]. Gonadotropin integrity in vivo is a kinetically regulated process [18] and the
slow rate of GPH dissociation is due to the seatbelt.
Indeed full dissociation is observed in less than five
minute instead of 24 h when the disulfide bridge fastening the seatbelt is open in reducing condition (GSH/GSSG
= 3) corresponding to that in endoplasmic reticulum
[14,17].
GPB5 molecules do not possess the polypeptide regions
corresponding to the seatbelt in glycoprotein hormones
β-subunits (additional file 1). It is thus expected that they
can indeed form a heterodimer with GPA2 with a Kd of
approximately 10-7-10-6 M like GPH subunits. Such a heterodimer would therefore exist only at concentrations
above 3-30 μg/ml. In keeping with this observation, the
recombinant heterodimer could be evidenced and purified when expressed at a very high concentration of 20
mg/l [21]. However, if the GPA2/GPB5 heterodimer is
secreted in the circulation to exert an endocrine role, it
should be present at micromolar concentration to retain
its quaternary structure. It would probably have already
been detected if present at such a high concentration.

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/90

In agreement with the absence of seatbelt in GPB5, the
GPA2/GPB5 heterodimer was not evidenced by SDSPAGE in contrast to GPH heterodimers [7]. Moreover,
even after chemical cross-linking, only a faint spot was
observed at the level expected for a dimer in SDS-PAGE
whereas the majority of material was found at the monomer level [7].
Expression patterns
It has been known for a long time that GPH α and β subunits readily form a heterodimer only when they are
expressed in the same cell and associate at high concentration and under moderate reducing redox potential in
endoplasmic reticulum to permit opening of the seatbelt
SS buckle [12,14,16,17]. Because of the absence of seatbelt, heterodimerization of GPA2 and GPB5 should not
require reducing redox potential but necessitates concentrations compatible with a Kd of more than 10-7M. It is
thus expected that the two molecules are co-expressed in
the same cell to allow dimerization. In fact, several papers
report that GPA2 and GPB5 mRNAs exhibit different tissue expression patterns in various species [22]. In contrast, other papers claim that the two molecules are
expressed together in pituitary corticotrophs [21] or in the
eye and testis but not in the pituitary [23]. Another interesting observation is that GPA2 is expressed at much
higher level and with higher tissue specificity than GPB5
that was found to be ubiquitarily expressed at low level
both in amphioxus [22] and in rat and bovine (Haj Hassan M. et al., in preparation).
Bioactivities of GPA2/GPB5 heterodimers
It is indeed important to ascertain that these molecules are
not mere variants of other molecules before looking for
their proper specific biological functions. Because of their
homology with GPHs α and β-subunits respectively,
GPA2 and GPB5 have been considered from the beginning to form a heterodimeric structure. In the princeps
paper, heterodimerization was only observed after treatment with bifunctional reagent and was very partial even
in these conditions (fig three in [7]). As this chemically
cross-linked heterodimer was found to exhibit thyrotropic
activity, it was named "thyreostimulin" [7].

A strong point in the princeps paper concerning GPA2 and
GPB5 [7] is that the authors observed thyroid-stimulating
activity for the cross-linked GPA2-GPB5 heterodimer. Like
LH and FSH receptors, TSH receptor is a seven-transmembrane span receptor with a very large extracellular domain
(ECD) that is responsible for high-affinity specific hormone binding. The three receptors exhibit strong homologies and constitute a well-defined superfamily. [24].
Nevertheless, in contrast to LH and FSH receptors, the
TSH receptor undergoes proteolytic maturation at the
hinge between its transmembrane domain and ECD and

Page 4 of 6

Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2009, 7:90

the two domains remain associated thanks to a SS bridge
[25,26]. Also, in contrast to LH and FSH receptors, TSH
receptor has been shown to be activable not only by its
cognate hormone TSH but also by desialylated hCG
[27,28] as well as by anti-TSH receptor antibodies [29] as
first observed in hyperthyroidic diseases. It thus appears
that the TSH receptor can be more readily stimulated by
ligands other than its cognate hormone than LH and FSH
receptors. It would thus be crucial that the GPA2/GPB5
heterodimer can be biochemically characterized to substantiate the functional properties that have been attributed to it [7,21,23,30-32].
The GPA2/GPB5 heterodimer under the name of Corticotroph-derived Glycoprotein Hormone (CGH) has also
been described to possess anti-inflammation activity and
to potentiate glucocorticoid action [33]. More recently,
expression patterns of GPA2 and GPB5 were described
during development [22] or in the adult [34,35] in
amphioxus and Dos Santos et al [22] evidenced distinct
expression patterns for the two molecules.

Taking all these information into account, it is reasonable
to hypothesize that GPA2 and GPB5 might be either individually secreted or not remain as a heterodimer when
secreted from the same cells when diluted in the bloodstream. GPA2 and GPB5 might thus play individual roles
either in the adult or during development like other 8-aaring cys-knot proteins such as DAN, Cer or Grem [36]. In
this respect, it is interesting to stress that free GPH-α subunit has been shown to exert a stimulatory role on lactogenic cells differenciation during pituitary development
[37-40]. Potential roles for GPA2 and GPB5 monomers
should also be searched [36].

Conclusion
The present comparative analysis of 8-aa-ring cys-knot
proteins raises arguments either supporting or challenging the view that the glycoprotein hormone subunits
related molecules GPA2 and GPB5 really form a functional heterodimer in vivo. Further studies, in particular
biochemical identification of the dimer and isolation of
natural GPA2, GPB5 molecules and/or the GPA2/GPB5
dimer are indispensable to understand the biological
role(s) of these molecules that are conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
