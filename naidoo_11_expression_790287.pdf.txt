Background
Eucalyptus species and their hybrids encompass
approximately 40% of forestry plantation area in South
Africa and contribute significantly to the paper pulp
industry due to their favourable wood fibre properties.
Eucalypt plantation trees are affected by numerous
pathogens during their lifetime, some of which can
cause severe losses such as Phytophtora spp and Chrysoporthe spp. Plant defence mechanisms against pathogens
is currently better understood in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana where it has been shown that the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signalling
pathways enhance resistance against biotrophic and
necrotrophic pathogens, respectively [1] . This process
involves the up-regulation of specific defence genes
which are considered to be marker (diagnostic) genes
for the two signalling pathways [2,3].
Methods
The aim of this study was to utilize the draft (8X) E.
grandis genome sequence that has recently become
available (http://eucalyptusdb.bi.up.ac.za) to identify
Eucalyptus orthologs of defence marker genes (e.g. PR2;
PR3; PR4; PR5; LOX2) specific for the SA and JA signalling pathways [2,3]. Bioinformatics tools were used to
identify putative orthologs of these marker genes in E.
grandis based on sequence information from other
plants. This was followed by a co-phylogenetic analysis
in which a neighbour-joining tree with 10 000 permutations was constructed to add confidence that the correct
orthologs had been identified. In the phylogenetic tree

analysis, closely related family members of a particular
gene were added to increase the certainty and accuracy
of selecting a specific ortholog.
The expression profile of the putative marker genes
was assessed via Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR) analysis of transcript levels following treatment with various concentrations of the inducers (SA
and JA) as well as different time points. This was done
to confirm that the putative orthologs respond to the
appropriate pathways in Eucalyptus. Additionally the
expression profile of these putative orthologs was analyzed in response to the causal agent of Eucalyptus stem
canker, Chrysoporthe austroafricana. The defence
response of Eucalyptus to this nectrotrophic pathogen
was investigated in both a tolerant (EgrTOL) and susceptible (EgrSUS) species. Changes in the level of transcript expression of the putative marker genes (PR2;
PR4; PR5; LOX3) were assessed at three time points
using RT-qPCR.

Results and discussion
A dose response experiment of the putative marker
genes was conducted with various concentrations to elucidate which would elicit the most paramount response
in gene expression. It was found that amongst the tested
candidates, 5mM and 100µM displayed the most significant change in gene expression for SA and JA respectively (Table 1). The specificity of the putative markers
was also determined by profiling the putative marker
genes with material induced by the opposing pathway,
i.e SA markers were assessed with MeJA induced
material.
A time course experiment was done to investigate
how the expression profiles of the genes respond over a
period of time. This would shed light on a possible

window period that one could focus on for enhancing
resistance as the timing of defence is crucial in determining the outcome of a pathogen interaction. For
example the PR2 gene, a marker for the SA pathway,
was shown to be drastically induced at 24hrs followed
by a decline at 48hrs. This could be due to the fact that
high levels of SA are toxic to the cell so the plant needs
to closely monitor SA levels. On the other hand PR4, a
marker for the JA pathway displayed a gradual increase
over time beginning at 6hrs and peaking at 48hrs.
When the putative marker genes were assessed in tissue infected with Chr. austroafricana, it was observed
that role of SA could potentially have a crucial role in
determining the outcome of the infection. It is interesting to note that at two weeks there is no significant difference in lesion length between EgrSUS and EgrTOL. In
EgrTOL, the expression level of PR2 was significantly
up-regulated at two weeks post-inoculation whereas EgrSUS had significantly altered levels of expression only at
six weeks. However in EgrSUS, the level to which PR2 is
induced is still lower than in EgrTOL. At two weeks and
six weeks there is an increase in PR4 transcript levels in
EgrSUS. This could explain the inability of EgrSUS to
accumulate SA due to the antagonistic relationship
between the two pathways which is in accordance to
what is currently known in Arabidopsis [1].

Conclusion
The genes identified in this study were tested as a diagnostic tool for the screening of pathogen challenged
eucalypt plant to determine which signaling pathway(s)
were playing a role in defence against various pathogens.
It was found that SA could potential play a role in
enhancing resistance to Chr. austroafricana. Future
work would involve studying the expression profile of
these genes in response to various other pathogens as
well as to elucidate more putative marker genes. This
research provides a platform from which to expand our
knowledge of plant defence in Eucalyptus and work
towards curbing tree diseases.
