Abstract
Background: The diversity of visual systems in fish has long been of interest for evolutionary
biologists and neurophysiologists, and has recently begun to attract the attention of molecular
evolutionary geneticists. Several recent studies on the copy number and genomic organization of
visual pigment proteins, the opsins, have revealed an increased opsin diversity in fish relative to
most vertebrates, brought about through recent instances of opsin duplication and divergence.
However, for the subfamily of opsin genes that mediate vision at the long-wavelength end of the
spectrum, the LWS opsins, it appears that most fishes possess only one or two loci, a value
comparable to most other vertebrates. Here, we characterize the LWS opsins from cDNA of an
individual guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a fish that is known exhibit variation in its long-wavelength
sensitive visual system, mate preferences and colour patterns.
Results: We identified six LWS opsins expressed within a single individual. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that these opsins descend from duplication events both pre-dating and following the
divergence of the guppy lineage from that of the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, the closest species
for which comparable data exists. Numerous amino acid substitutions exist among these different
LWS opsins, many at sites known to be important for visual pigment function, including spectral
sensitivity and G-protein activation. Likelihood analyses using codon-based models of evolution
reveal significant changes in selective constraint along two of the guppy LWS opsin lineages.
Conclusion: The guppy displays an unusually high number of LWS opsins compared to other fish,
and to vertebrates in general. Observing both substitutions at functionally important sites and the
persistence of lineages across species boundaries suggests that these opsins might have functionally
different roles, especially with regard to G-protein activation. The reasons why are currently
unknown, but may relate to aspects of the guppy's behavioural ecology, in which both male colour
patterns and the female mate preferences for these colour patterns experience strong, highly
variable selection pressures.

Background
An organism's ability to perceive, and respond to the challenges arising in its environment depends critically on the
specific nature and design of its sensory system. Alterations in the molecular components of the transduction
cascade can have profound consequences for sensory perception, offering the opportunity to better understand the
evolution of these molecular pathways in the context of
the environments in which an animal may reside. Sensory
systems are therefore ideally suited for evolutionary investigations at the molecular level. For example, it has been
shown that fish living at increasing depths have adapted
to the changing light environment by blue-shifting their
visual sensitivities via specific amino acid substitutions in
one of the visual pigments that form the first step in the
sensory visual pathway [1].
Visual systems are particularly amenable to molecular
evolutionary analysis not only because of the diversity of
light environments and visually-mediated tasks in which
vision may be required, but also because the details of the
primary phototransduction cascade have been fairly well
characterized. In vertebrates, the first step in the visual cascade are the visual pigments, membrane-spanning protein
complexes located in the outer segments of the rod and
cone photoreceptor cells of the retina [2]. They are composed of two parts, an opsin protein component, which is
a member of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily,
and a vitamin A-derived chromophore that is covalently
bound to the opsin via a Schiff-base linkage. Absorbing a
photon of light causes the chromophore to isomerize,
triggering a conformational change in the opsin protein
that allows it to activate the second messenger transducin,
a heterotrimeric G-protein, which ultimately leads to a
neural signal that light has been perceived [3,4]. Different
visual pigments can be most sensitive to photons of differing wavelengths. Spectral tuning, the process by which a
visual pigment's spectral sensitivity is modified, is usually
achieved through amino acid substitutions that alter the
environment of the chromophore within the opsin binding pocket [5,6]. Visual pigments in vertebrates are composed of five families of opsin genes [7]: the SWS1, SWS2,
RH2, and LWS cone opsins that function under brightlight, or photopic conditions, and the RH1 rod opsins, or
rhodopsins, that allow for vision under dim-light, or scotopic, conditions.
This dichotomy in the vertebrate visual system is reflected
in the fact that cone and rod photoreceptors generally
have distinct morphologies and physiological functions
related to their divergent roles in day vs. night vision, with
cones tending to be less photosensitive but having faster
response kinetics than rods [8]. At least some of these differences are thought to be mediated by differing components of the visual transduction pathways contained

within each cell type. In addition to cone visual pigments,
cone-specific transducins [9], cGMP phosphodiesterases
[10], cGMP-gated ion channels [11], and arrestins [12]
have been found. While many of the specifics of the
molecular influences on photoreceptor response kinetics
remain unknown, it seems likely that some of the differences in response are due to differences in G-protein activation, as cone visual pigments are known to be less
efficient in activating transducin relative to rod pigments
[13].
The study of vision in fish has long attracted the attention
of comparative and evolutionary biologists due to the varied and often extreme lighting conditions present in the
underwater environment [14,15]. In recent years, it has
been discovered that many fishes have experienced several
additional rounds of opsin duplication and divergence
relative to other vertebrate groups. For example, where the
typical vertebrate might possess one member of each of
the LWS, SWS1, SWS2, and RH2 cone opsin families, the
zebrafish (Danio rerio) possesses two LWS, one SWS1, one
SWS2, and four RH2 opsins [16], while the distantly
related medaka (Oryzias latipes) possesses two LWS
opsins, one SWS1 opsin, two SWS2 opsins, and three RH2
opsins [17]. Phylogenetic relationships suggest that these
additional opsin duplication events occurred independently in the lineages leading to these two fishes [17],
though this pattern may also reflect concerted evolution,
resulting in homogenized gene sequences within species
[18]. Though it is tempting to suggest that these increased
opsin numbers reflect one of the whole genome duplication events thought to have occurred in the fish lineage
[19], this does not appear to be the case; evidence from
whole genome sequencing projects and the sequencing of
opsins from genomic libraries suggests that the SWS2 and
LWS opsins are consistently arranged in one tandem
array, while the multiple RH2 opsins are arranged in
another (zebrafish D. rerio [16]; medaka O. latipes [17],
Lake Malawi cichlids [20], cavefish Astyanax fasciatus [21],
and the pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridins [19]). This pattern is consistent with shared opsin duplication events
occurring early in these fishes' evolution, but through
local duplication events, not genome duplications. In
many cases, the duplicated opsins display numerous
amino acid substitutions and substantial differences in
spectral sensitivity (e.g., the RH2 opsins of zebrafish,
whose spectral sensitivity maxima are located from 467
nm to 505 nm; [16]), which is indicative of functional
divergence following the duplication events.
In this paper we describe our investigation of the LWS
opsins of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. The guppy has long
served as a model system for researchers interested in natural and sexual selection, and is notable among fish in
that it displays extremely high levels of variation for a

number of traits, both behavioural and morphological
[22,23]. Both male colour patterns [24] and female mate
preferences for these colour patterns [25], for instance,
vary dramatically among individuals within and among
populations. Furthermore, microspectrophotometry
(MSP) analysis of the guppy's photoreceptor cells revealed
visual system variation; guppies appears to possess three
photoreceptors maximally sensitive to different wavelengths of long-wavelength light, but the retina of individual fish may have different numbers and combinations of
these three photoreceptors [26,27]. It was suggested that
these three different photoreceptors reflect the presence of
two spectrally-distinct LWS visual pigments, expressed
either independently or in conjunction [27]. We characterized the LWS opsins of the guppy using degenerate
primers to amplify LWS opsin fragments from a cDNA
library constructed from a single individual. Surprisingly,
our results indicate that guppy LWS opsins have experienced several recent rounds of duplication and divergence, and reveal the presence of at least six expressed
LWS opsin sequences in a single individual.

Results and Discussion
We amplified and sequenced, from cDNA obtained from
a single guppy individual, six LWS opsin sequences corresponding to a 390 bp fragment of the LWS opsin (designated as 'guppy LWS1–6'; Genbank accession numbers
DQ865167–DQ865172). This fragment of the opsin corresponds to LWS exons 4 and 5, and codes for the portion
spanning from the beginning of the second extracellular
loop to the middle of the seventh transmembrane domain
(Fig. 1). Variation within this portion of the gene is
known to have a disproportionately large effect on visual
pigment phenotype [6]. Most notably, this fragment contains transmembrane domains 5 and 6, which include
many of the known LWS spectral tuning sites, including
residues 277 and 285 that account for much of the difference between human red and green visual pigments [6].
This fragment also contains the third cytoplasmic loop,
which is thought to strongly influence the interaction
between the activated visual pigment and the downstream
G-protein [3,4].
In order to eliminate errors due to enzyme misincorporations, template switching and other PCR artifacts, multiple clones from separate PCR reactions were sequenced,
and an error rate of ~0.2% was allowed among the clones
(see Methods for error rate calculations, and number of
clones sequenced). One of the opsins, LWS5, which may
be expressed at low levels, was only isolated once from
cDNA, but several clones were isolated and sequenced
from genomic DNA. The other five LWS opsin sequences
obtained from cDNA were confirmed by designing primers specific to each LWS sequence, and performing amplifications from genomic DNA as well. These genomic

amplification products were then sequenced to confirm
they were the same as those isolated from cDNA.
Among the six opsin sequences found, there were a total
of 59 variable nucleotide sites and 20 variable amino acid
sites (Fig. 2). Percentage sequence differences among the
guppy LWS opsin sequences ranged from 1.04% to 14.3 %
(distances computed with the method of Hasegawa et al.
(HKY) [28]; Additional file 1). All guppy sequences had
functionally critical residues known to be conserved
among vertebrate opsins, such as the highly conserved
lysine to which the chromophore is covalently bound via
a Schiff-base linkage (Lys312; all numbering according to
human LWS opsin), and a cysteine residue (Cys207)
involved in a disulphide linkage with a residue in the
third transmembrane helix, Cys126 [3,4,6]. These observations, along with the fact that the sequences were
obtained from mRNA expressed in the head, suggest that
the guppy LWS opsins are functional.
We aligned the guppy LWS opsins with a sample of teleost
fish LWS opsin sequences (Fig. 2), including the medaka
(Oryzias latipes) [17], two cichids (Dimidiochromis compressiceps and Oreochromis niloticus) [20], two pufferfish
(Tetraodon nigroviridis and Takifugu rubripes) [29], and a
close relative of the guppy, the bluefin killifish (Lucania
goodei) [30]. LWS opsins from the more distantly related
ayu smelt (Plecoglossus altivelis) [31], Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar) [32], and zebrafish (Danio rerio) [16] were
also included as outgroups. Figure 3 presents the results of
phylogenetic analyses performed on this alignment.
Though some nodes are weakly supported, the relationships among the ingroup acanthopterygian fish are consistent with current phylogenetic hypotheses for this
group [33,34]. Interestingly, the LWS opsins of the guppy
and the killifish, which is currently known to have at least
two LWS opsins, display trans-specific evolution; that is,
guppy LWS6 is most closely related to L. goodei LWSB
while guppy LWS1–5 are most closely related to L. goodei
LWSA (Figs. 3, 4). This pattern suggests that a LWS opsin
duplication event (either involving the divergence of alleles within a locus, or the establishment of separate loci)
pre-dated the guppy-killifish split, and that four more
duplication events have occurred more recently within the
guppy lineage. Whether or not all of the different guppy
LWS opsin sequences represent products of true gene
duplication events, or instead divergence among alleles
within a single gene locus, is not currently known, but the
results suggest that the guppy has at least three and possibly as many as six LWS opsin loci.
Observing this many distinct LWS opsin sequences in a
single individual guppy is a highly surprising result. Not
only is this number larger than the estimate derived from
MSP analysis of guppy LWS photoreceptor cells [27], but

it is, to our knowledge, greater than has been found for
any other fish studied to date. Whole genome sequencing
or screening and mapping of genomic libraries has confirmed single LWS opsins in two species of pufferfish [29],
and two LWS opsins in both the zebrafish [16] and
medaka [17], while screening and Southern blotting of a
genomic library suggests the presence of two (or possibly
three) LWS loci in the cavefish (Astyanax fasciatus) [21]. In
humans, the LWS opsins are located tandemly along the
X-chromosome; this tandem array expands and contracts
as a result of non-homologous recombination events [6],
and individuals can have from one to six X-linked LWS
opsins per X chromosome [35,36]. The genomic organization of guppy LWS opsins is not currently known, but if
guppy LWS opsins are arranged in a tandem array then it

is possible that similar mechanisms may have generated
the larger number of guppy LWS opsins.
Evolutionary patterns of selective constraint were investigated in our data set using codon-based likelihood phylogenetic models, as implemented in PAML [37,38].
Estimating the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous
rates (dN/dS or ω) in a single parameter model (M0) on
the tree shown in Fig. 3 revealed a low overall dN/dS ratio
of 0.08737 (Table 1). This is indicative of fairly strong
purifying selection across sites, a result typical of most
studies of proteins with highly conserved functional roles
[39]. Models that allow ω to vary across sites were implemented in order to test for sites that may be under positive
selection [40-42]; however, none of these tests were able

to detect evidence of positive selection in our data set.
Models incorporating site classes under positive selection
were not found to be significantly better than neutral
models in likelihood ratio tests, including M1a/M2a, and
M7/M8 comparisons (Table 1). Only the M0/M3 comparison was significant, though this is not a strict test of positive selection. For the M3 model, the third site class was
found to have a greatly elevated dN/dS ratio, though even
in this case it remains below 1 (ω2 = 0.64).
Branch [43] and branch-sites [42,44] models were also
implemented in order to test for changes in selective constraint along lineages leading to the more divergent
sequences, LWS5 and LWS6 (Fig. 3). Both lineages were
found to have a statistically significant, or nearly significant, increase in dN/dS ratio (over 5-fold in both cases;
Table 1). These ratios were found to be even more elevated in branch-sites models (LWS5, ω2 = 16.5; LWS6, ω2
= 1.0), although the addition of this site class was not
found to be statistically significant in either lineage (Table
1).
The significant changes in selective constraint in some of
the LWS opsin lineages led us to examine in further detail
sites that may be important in shifting opsin function in
our data set. Several LWS opsin spectral tuning sites have
been identified through comparative sequence analysis
and site-directed mutagenesis studies [6,45-47]. Among
the guppy LWS opsins identified in this study, variation
exists at several sites known to be functionally important

(Fig. 4; Table 2). Most notable are the differences at sites
277 and 285; guppy LWS5 possesses the same residues at
those sites as the human green-LWS opsin (phenylalanine
and alanine, respectively), while guppy LWS1–4,6 possess
the same residues as the human red-LWS opsin (tyrosine
and phenylalanine). These two substitutions are known,
through mutagenesis, to cause a relatively large spectral
shift of approximately 15–25 nm, and are the primary
substitutions responsible for the functional difference
between human red and green LWS opsins [6,45-47]. This
strongly suggests that the LWS5 may shifted toward
shorter wavelengths (i.e., more toward the green) relative
to the other guppy LWS opsins isolated in this study. This
shift in function may be the reason for the significantly
elevated dN/dS ratio found in codon-based models allowing for an additional ω parameter along this branch
(Table 1). Moreover, branch-sites models identified both
residues 277 and 285 as possible targets of positive selection, though inclusion of this class of positively selected
sites was not found to be statistically significant (Table 1).
Sites 230 and 233, minor spectral tuning sites, are also
variable in some of the sequences in our data set (Fig. 4,
Table 2). At site 230, guppy LWS6 possesses a threonine,
while the rest possess an isoleucine; this mutation was
found to alter spectral sensitivity by a few nm in human
LWS opsins [45]. At site 233, guppy LWS3–5 possess a glycine, while the rest possess an alanine; mutagenesis studies have shown that substituting a serine for an alanine at
this site does have a small effect on spectral sensitivity in

human LWS opsin [45]. The effects of such substitutions
on spectral sensitivity are small enough that they are often
undetected by methods such as MSP, which could explain
why MSP studies of guppy photoreceptor cells suggested a
relatively low number of visual pigments (2) sensitive to
long-wavelength light [26,27] relative to the higher
number of LWS opsin sequences (6) found in this study.
There are also additional substitutions observed among
guppy LWS opsin sequences that have not yet been
explored by mutagenesis methods which may influence
spectral sensitivity as well (for example, site 234, which is
immediately adjacent to the minor spectral tuning site
233). Such mutations will require experimental evalua-

tion through site-directed mutagenesis and spectrophotometric analysis of expressed visual pigments [45].
Variation also exists among guppy LWS opsin sequences
at sites that likely influence other, non-spectral properties
of the visual pigment (Fig. 4, Table 2). The most notable
differences occur within the third cytoplasmic loop, a portion of the visual pigment known to be critically important for binding and activating transducin following the
absorption of a photon of light [48,49]. Guppy LWS6 differs from the rest at seven AA sites within this loop. The
effect of several of these sites on transducin activation
rates was experimentally tested in mutated bovine rho-

dopsin expressed in vitro [48] (Table 2). The effect of most
substitutions was to reduce transducin activation in the
mutants relative to wildtype bovine rhodopsin. The physiochemical properties of residues at sites 247, 248, and
264, guppy LWS6 are more similar to the wildtype bovine
rhodopsin, suggesting that guppy LWS6 may have an
enhanced transducin activating ability as compared with
other guppy LWS opsins. However, the residues possessed
by guppy LWS6 at sites 256, 261, and 263 appear to be
unique among vertebrate opsins, with all other vertebrate
opsins being either invariant or possessing residues with
fairly different physiochemical properties.
The resemblance of the residues in guppy LWS6 at key
sites with rhodopsin, combined with the known importance of the third cytoplasmic loop in G-protein binding
and activation [49,50], raise the interesting possibility
that the guppy LWS6 opsin may have divergent function
with regards to transducin activation relative to other LWS
opsins. Many of these same substitutions in the third cytoplasmic loop are present in L. goodei LWSB, the killifish
opsin most closely related to guppy LWS6, including the
unique substitutions at site 256, 261, and 263 (Fig. 3,
Table 2), suggesting that variation in transducin activating
capacity is being selectively maintained. This is consistent
with our codon-based analyses using branch-specific
models, which revealed a nearly statistically significant,
5.4-fold increase in ω along the branch leading to guppy
LWS6 and L. goodei LWSB (Fig. 4), even if the branch-site
analysis of this lineage did not provide any evidence of
positive selection (Table 1). Interestingly, Bayes Empirical
Bayes [42] analysis did identify five residues (including
sites with known influence on transducin activation [48]),
all within the third cytoplasmic loop (residues 248, 249,
256, 261 and 263).
The evolutionary mechanisms that have promoted and
maintained this diversity of LWS opsins in the guppy
remain to be investigated. Guppies are known to have
highly variable colour patterns and mate preferences [22].
The chroma of orange patches on male guppies varies
among individuals, and it has been suggested that these
differences may reflect differences in male foraging ability
or parasite load [22]. By having multiple LWS opsins with
slight variation in spectral sensitivity, female guppies may
be able to better discriminate among differently coloured
males [51,52] or the brightly-coloured fruits that occasionally fall into the guppy's streams [53]. Also, it has
been observed in the cichlid Metriaclima zebra that a
region of the cichlid genome that influences colour pattern is closely linked to the SWS2-LWS opsin tandem array
[54]; selection acting to maintain colour pattern variation
could potentially lead to the maintenance of variation in
physically linked opsin genes. Both directional [22,25]
and balancing [55,56] selection have been shown to oper-

ate on variation in male colour patterns in the guppy, and
could therefore function to influence visual variation if a
similar linkage exists in the guppy. In future work, we plan
to investigate the relationship between behavioural ecology and opsin molecular biology in the guppy by studying
the influence of opsin genes on individual behaviour and
fitness.

Conclusion
Our results demonstrated the presence of at least six
expressed LWS opsin sequences within a single guppy
individual. This number is substantially higher than the
number found in any other fish to date, and higher than
the minimum number previously estimated for the guppy
by MSP. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that these guppy
LWS opsins fall into two groups, one group of relatively
closely related sequences, and another that appears to
have descended from a duplication event pre-dating the
guppy-killifish split. Many of the amino acid substitutions
that distinguish these guppy LWS opsins appear at sites
thought to be functionally important, either for spectral
tuning or transducin activation. This is consistent with
codon-based analyses, which indicate changes in selective
constraint along two of the more divergent lineages of
guppy LWS opsins.

Methods
Total RNA was extracted from the head of a single male
guppy sampled from a tributary of the Paria River, Trinidad. The fish was anesthetized in MS-222 solution, its
head dissected and ground on dry ice, and the RNA isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Single stranded
mRNA was converted to double stranded cDNA via
reverse transcriptase (SMART cDNA Library construction
kit; BD Bioscience). Both primer extension and low-density PCR strategies were employed (involving 9 to 30
amplification cycles per reaction) to generate double
stranded cDNA. Internal fragments of the guppy's LWS
opsin coding sequence were amplified (43 amplification
cycles per reaction) using FastStart Taq polymerase
(Roche) and degenerate primers designed from conserved
regions of published vertebrate M/LWS opsins (Forward
primers VertRG168F 5'-TGC GCT CCT CCN ATH TTY GG
and VertRG173F 5'-TTT GGA TGG TCN CGN TAY TGG
CC, and Reverse primer VertRG313R 5'-GCG GAA CTG
TCG ATT CAT RAA NAC RTA DAT). Given the number of
amplification cycles and the error rates of the enzymes,
this procedure is expected to yield an error rate of approximately 10-3, or about 0.53 nucleotide misincorporations
per 390 bp fragment amplified. Amplified fragments were
then cloned into plasmid vectors using TA cloning kits
(Invitrogen), purified via spin columns (Qiagen and
Eppendorf), and sequenced with modified M13 vector
primers on an ABI Prism 3100 sequencer. For each LWS
opsin isolated, multiple clones from separate PCR reac-

tions were sequenced in both directions to control for
enzyme misincorporations, template switching and
sequencing artifacts (LWS1, 29 clones; LWS2, 12 clones;
LWS3, 15 clones; LWS4, 6 clones; LWS5, 1 clone; LWS6, 9
clones). In order to confirm the existence of the different
LWS opsin sequences found in cDNA, portions of the
opsin that distinguished the guppy LWS sequences from
each other were also amplified from genomic DNA using
specific primers, and sequenced. For the LWS5 opsin,
although only one cDNA clone was isolated, multiple
clones (7) were sequenced from genomic DNA amplifications.
Vertebrate LWS opsin sequence alignment was carried out
via ClustalW [57]. Amino acid sequences were aligned,
and from this the nucleotide alignment was inferred. Preliminary rounds of phylogenetic analysis (Neighbourjoining method), carried out separately on the upstream
and downstream halves, revealed a small number of
clones as likely instances of recombination among clones
during amplification; these clones were excluded from
further analysis. The low amount of statistical power
afforded by the small size of the dataset precluded the use
of more refined methods for detecting instances of template switching. Several different methods of phylogenetic
analyses were performed on the alignment shown in Figure 2, with smelt (P. altivelis), salmon (S. salar), and
zebrafish (D. rerio LWS2) LWS opsins used as outgroups.
Hierarchical likelihood ratio tests, implemented in Modeltest 3.6 [58], identified the HKY+G model as the best fitting model. Neighbour-joining, maximum parsimony,
and maximum likelihood analyses were carried out in
PAUP* 4.0b10 [59]. Parsimony heuristic searches were
implemented with 1000 random addition replicates.
Node support was assessed using bootstrap analysis [60],
as implemented in PAUP* 4.0b10 [59], for the neighborjoining (1000 replicates, HKY+G model), parsimony
(1000 replicates), and maximum likelihood analyses
(100 replicates, HKY+G model). Bayesian analyses were
carried out in Mr. Bayes 3.1.1 [61]. Four simultaneous
chains were run for 107 generations, with tree sampling
every 100 generations (for a total of 100000 trees). The
first 5000 trees were considered 'burn-in' and discarded.
Most parsimonious ancestral reconstructions, and mapping of amino acid substitutions onto the phylogeny were
carried out using MacClade v4.0 [62].
Evolutionary patterns of selective constraint were assessed
using codon-based likelihood analyses as implemented in
PAML v3.15 [38], using the aligned nucleotide dataset
and the tree topology shown in Fig. 3. PAML uses a maximum likelihood framework to estimate dN/dS (ω) for the
entire dataset and tree (M0 model), for particular lineages
(branch models), for particular codons (sites models), or
for particular codons within particular lineages (branch-

site models) (reviewed in [37]; also see [40-44] for specificities on the various models employed). The ω value is
thought to reflect the degree of evolutionary constraint, or
selection pressure operating on the site class and/or lineage of interest, with 0 < ω < 1 indicating purifying selection, ω = 1 neutral evolution, and ω > 1 positive selection
[63]. Nested models are compared via likelihood ratio
tests, with the test statistic following a χ2 distribution with
degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number
of parameters between the two models [60,64]. Likelihood ratio tests were carried out using the program chi2,
which is bundled with the PAML software package [37].
Bayes Empirical Bayes analysis, as implemented in PAML,
was used to identify particular residues within the dataset
as likely targets of positive selection [42].
