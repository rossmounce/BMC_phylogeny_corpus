Evolutionary diversification of cryophilic
Grylloblatta species (Grylloblattodea:
Grylloblattidae) in alpine habitats of California
Research article

Abstract
Background: Climate in alpine habitats has undergone extreme variation during Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs,
resulting in repeated expansion and contraction of alpine glaciers. Many cold-adapted alpine species have responded
to these climatic changes with long-distance range shifts. These species typically exhibit shallow genetic
differentiation over a large geographical area. In contrast, poorly dispersing organisms often form species complexes
within mountain ranges, such as the California endemic ice-crawlers (Grylloblattodea: Grylloblattidae: Grylloblatta). The
diversification pattern of poorly dispersing species might provide more information on the localized effects of historical
climate change, the importance of particular climatic events, as well as the history of dispersal. Here we use multi-locus
genetic data to examine the phylogenetic relationships and geographic pattern of diversification in California
Grylloblatta.
Results: Our analysis reveals a pattern of deep genetic subdivision among geographically isolated populations of
Grylloblatta in California. Alpine populations diverged from low elevation populations and subsequently diversified.
Using a Bayesian relaxed clock model and both uncalibrated and calibrated measurements of time to most recent
common ancestor, we reconstruct the temporal diversification of alpine Grylloblatta populations. Based on calibrated
relaxed clock estimates, evolutionary diversification of Grylloblatta occurred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene epochs,
with an initial dispersal into California during the Pliocene and species diversification in alpine clades during the middle
Pleistocene epoch.
Conclusions: Grylloblatta species exhibit a high degree of genetic subdivision in California with well defined
geographic structure. Distinct glacial refugia can be inferred within the Sierra Nevada, corresponding to major,
glaciated drainage basins. Low elevation populations are sister to alpine populations, suggesting alpine populations
may track expanding glacial ice sheets and diversify as a result of multiple glacial advances. Based on relaxed-clock
molecular dating, the temporal diversification of Grylloblatta provides evidence for the role of a climate-driven species
pump in alpine species during the Pleistocene epoch.
Background
In the present climate, many low-latitude mountain
ranges are environmentally isolated from one another by
intervening low elevation habitat. Geological and paleoecological data indicate that cooling global climate led to
the historical growth of alpine glaciers [1,2] and to downslope range shifts of montane vegetation [3,4]. It has been
argued that ice age climates provided environmental cor* Correspondence: schoville@berkeley.edu

ridors between mountain ranges that enabled arctic and
alpine populations to migrate into and among sky-islands
[5,6]. This hypothesis suggests that the expansion of continental and alpine glaciers during recent climatic cycles
of the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs facilitated spatial
expansion of populations in alpine environments and,
subsequently, contraction of these glaciers led to the
diversification of geographically isolated lineages.
Molecular genetic studies support this hypothesis in
several ways. First, several wide-ranging arctic species
also inhabit alpine habitats [7] and these isolated populations exhibit recent genetic divergence [8-11]. This is

most easily explained by colonization events or gene flow
during the last glacial cycle. Second, many alpine species
comprise closely related populations separated on geographically distant mountain ranges. These patterns are
evident in mountainous regions in North America
[12,13], Japan [14,15], Europe [e.g. [16]], and New Zealand [17]. Finally, several molecular studies examining
divergence patterns of populations on separate mountains have detected low levels of gene flow during the
divergence process, implying connectivity during glacial
periods [18,19]. Fossil remains also suggest that winged
insects [20-22] and plants commonly exhibit widespread
range shifts during glacial cycles [3,23].
Most of the alpine organisms exhibiting these spatial
patterns are highly vagile species. In contrast, many
alpine species that have low vagility are considered to be
restricted endemics and often form species complexes
within mountain ranges [24]. The phylogeographic history of low vagility organisms might therefore exhibit different patterns [25,26] and can offer several important
contributions to the study of alpine biogeographic history. First, population diversification of poorly dispersing
species might provide insight on the effects of alpine glaciations within mountain ranges, in particular by delineating the spatial location of climatic refugia. Second, the
temporal pattern of diversification within and between
these species might provide information on the relative
impact of different glacial cycles because poorly dispersing populations are more likely to diverge genetically due
to the stochastic effects of genetic drift [27]. Third, low
vagility species provide an opportunity to understand the
dispersal history of populations in alpine environments.
For example, these species clarify whether shifts in elevation are necessary to the survival of alpine populations, or
if populations managed to survive in high elevation refugia [i.e. ice-free nunataks; [28]]. Similarly, under a "progression-rule" biogeographic model [29], ancestraldescendent relationships could be used to infer the direction of colonization into mountain ranges by a dispersing
population.
In this study, the evolutionary history of a low vagility
species complex is examined within California. Grylloblatta species (Grylloblattodea: Grylloblattidae), or icecrawlers, are members of an ancient lineage that evolved
during the radiation of neopterous insects [30]. All Grylloblatta species are cryophilic, with an obligate link to
stable near-freezing temperatures. Acute physiological
temperature tolerance ranges from -8.5 to 10°C in an
undescribed species on Mt. Ranier [31], and low temperature tolerance is a conserved trait in the genus [32]. Very
few arthropods survive prolonged exposure to temperatures experienced on snow fields, but Grylloblatta have a

Page 2 of 14

foraging strategy utilizing snow-fields, where wind-blown
insects and organic detritus are deposited (into the "Aeolian ecosystem") and form an energy rich resource for
scavenging insects [33]. While five extant genera of Grylloblattidae are known, less than thirty species have been
described. These species occur in northeastern Asia
(Korea, Japan, China and Russia) and western North
America (Canada and the western United States). A single genus, Grylloblatta, occurs in North America with
eleven described species, five of which occur in California. In California, Grylloblatta species are restricted to
montane areas, caves, and deep canyons, and within
these habitats remain in close proximity to permanent ice
and deep retreats in rock outcrops. Previous to this study,
most of the California species were known from type
localities and are extremely rare in entomological collections.
Kamp [34,35], working on populations of grylloblattids
in northeastern California and the Canadian Rocky
Mountains, proposed that contemporary populations
were relicts of populations broadly distributed in periglacial habitat during glacial periods. He hypothesized that
1) populations expanded their geographic range during
glacial cycles and that 2) alpine populations colonized
high elevation habitat after the retreat of glacial ice. We
set out to test Kamp's [34] ideas by studying the genetic
relationships of California Grylloblatta populations in the
context of alpine glacial cycles in California. We attempt
to explicitly test whether the diversification of Grylloblatta in California is intimately tied to glacial-interglacial
fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Previous studies have
shown that low vagility organisms often exhibit deep
genetic breaks due to stochastic processes [25,26]. While
these genetic breaks can occur at random in continuously
distributed populations [36], they also occur due to evolutionary and environmental events that impede gene
flow [37]. Multi-locus phylogenies offer a way to distinguish between random and non-random genetic breaks
[38]. A previous multi-locus phylogeny of grylloblattid
populations in both the Pacific Northwest and northeastern Asia [39] showed a recurrent pattern of deep genetic
subdivision over a small geographical area, suggesting
that California grylloblattids might provide similar levels
of phylogenetic substructure. We therefore utilize genetic
sequence data from multiple independent loci to infer the
population genetic history, phylogenetic relationships
and diversification time of California Grylloblatta species. Our results support Kamp's hypothesis that Grylloblatta populations expanded spatially at the edges of
glacial habitat. Furthermore, we provide evidence that
Pleistocene climatic shifts have had a direct role in Grylloblatta species formation.

Population Genetic Patterns of Grylloblatta

A total of 132 individuals of Grylloblatta from 30 sites
(Figure 1; Additional file 1 Table 1S) were screened for
genetic variation at four genes. There were 52 unique
COII haplotypes, with one individual (Lillburn Cave) having two highly divergent copies. These copies were amplified with two different primer sets, never co-amplified,
and yet translate into appropriate amino acid residues.
Although it is unclear whether or not this individual has
acquired a nuclear mitochondrial DNA gene (numt), or is
heteroplasmic, analyses using alternate copies did not significantly alter phylogenetic results. The copy amplified
from the least degenerate mitochondrial primers was
chosen for subsequent divergence time analyses. There
were 12 unique sequences of the nuclear histone (h3)
gene, 16 unique sequences of the nuclear 18 S gene, and
18 unique sequences of the nuclear 28 S gene. The combined sequences included a total of 5,542 sites (with
gaps), with considerable rate variation among genes
(Table 1). All sequences have been deposited in NCBI's
GenBank (Accessions: FJ918575-FJ918687, GU013769GU013770; Additional file 2 Table 2S).
In five well-sampled alpine populations, within-population genetic variation is quite low (Table 2). Mitochondrial DNA variation approaches zero in the Sonora Pass,
White Mountain and Graveyard Lakes populations
(range θS per bp = 0.000-0.001, range θπ per bp = 0.0000.001). In contrast, the Barker Pass and Susie Lake populations exhibit slightly higher mtDNA variation (range θS
per bp = 0.004-0.007, range θπ per bp = 0.006). In all populations, variation in the nuclear gene histone is low and
approaches zero. Tests for deviation from neutral equilibrium are non-significant in most populations, although
some show a trend towards negative D and FS values. The
Susie Lake population exhibits significant negative D and
FS values in the histone locus, possibly indicating recent
population expansion. Mismatch distribution tests for
most populations across loci were consistent with a
model of sudden population expansion, the exception
being the Barker Pass population for COII. Under a spa-

Estimates of Phylogenetic Relationships

The concatenated phylogenies estimated from the
unrooted Bayesian analysis (Figure 2) and the maximum
likelihood bootstrap analysis (Figure 3) are very similar.
Notable differences in the relationships of a few lineages
(see gray highlighting) under these two methods largely
concern the order of early branching events in the phylogeny. Separate Bayesian analyses of the mitochondrial
data (Additional file 3 Figure 1S) and nuclear data (Additional file 4 Figure 2S) provide similar topologies to the
Bayesian concatenated phylogeny, although fine scale
geographic structure is only evident in the mitochondrial
data. The concatenated phylogenetic analysis identifies
three to four major lineages, with substantial phylogeographic structure within these lineages (Figure 4). The
first lineage represents the Oregon Cave sample of southern Oregon. The second lineage includes two unique
taxa, G. gurneyi and G. chandleri, sampled from northeastern California. The third lineage includes all individuals from the Sierra Nevada. In the maximum likelihood
analysis, a fourth lineage is identified, which is nested
within the Sierra Nevada lineage in the Bayesian analysis.
This lineage includes G. rothi (Three Sisters, Oregon) and
G. barberi (Feather River, California), which form a sister
group in both analyses. Within the Sierra Nevada lineage,
there is further subdivision into two major clades, including a northern Sierra Nevada clade and a southern Sierra
Nevada clade (9.8% uncorrected mtDNA divergence).
Within each of the Sierra Nevada clades there are
strongly supported monophyletic groups that are geographically subdivided. The northern Sierra Nevada
includes G. bifratrilecta, G. washoa, and a Tioga Crest
subclade (5.6-7.1% uncorrected mtDNA divergence). The
southern Sierra Nevada clade includes a southwest Sierra
Nevada and a central Sierra Nevada subclade (3.1%
uncorrected mtDNA divergence), as well as a deeply
divergent subclade including Ostrander Lake-Indian
Cave, Lillburn Cave, and a unique individual at Graveyard
Lakes. The unusual Graveyard Lakes specimen is a juve-

nile which was sympatric and actively foraging with grylloblattids from the Central Sierra Nevada lineage, yet
exhibits 6.6% uncorrected mtDNA divergence as well as
unique nuclear alleles. The subclade including Ostrander
Lake-Indian Cave, Lillburn Cave and the Graveyard Lake
specimen are sister to the alpine populations in the
southern Sierra Nevada. There is further geographic subdivision within the alpine subclades, notably north ("Carson Pass") to south ("Sonora Pass") in G. bifratrilecta and
northeast ("White Mountains"), north ("North-Central"),
and south ("South-Central") in the Central Sierra Nevada
subclade.
Temporal Pattern of Diversification

Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) was
estimated using a Bayesian relaxed clock model with two
different methods: an unscaled, fixed evolutionary rate
and a calibrated molecular clock (Table 3). Unscaled estimates of TMRCA provide a representation of the tempo of
diversification, unbiased by a prior on the molecular substitution rate. In the alpine populations, pulses of diversification are evident at several different time intervals,
first in the diversification within the northern and southern Sierra Nevada clades, then in the diversification of
subclades (G. bifratrilecta, G. washoa, Tioga Crest, Central Sierra Nevada, and Southwest Sierra Nevada), and
finally in the diversification within populations of these
subclades (White Mountains, Carson Pass and Sonora

Pass). The time of divergence roughly doubles across
these different levels and this is clear in the unscaled
relaxed clock estimates, as well as the clock analysis.
However, median estimates of TMRCA in both methods
result in large confidence intervals and the lineage
through time plot (Additional file 5 Figure 3S) does not
indicate synchronous pulses of diversification. Instead,
divergence rates are shown to be high in the past relative
to a constant-rate model, with a subsequent decline and a
more recent recovery.
The calibrated molecular clock estimates have large
confidence intervals, but the median estimates of
TMRCA suggest Grylloblatta species inhabited California before the onset of the Pleistocene (~4.53 million
years B.P., Table 3). TMRCA of major lineages in the
Sierra Nevada are estimated to be in the Early Pleistocene
(~1.94 MY for the Northern Sierra Nevada clade, ~2.52
for the Southern Sierra Nevada clade) and during the
Early to Middle Pleistocene for geographically isolated
subclades in the Sierra Nevada.

Discussion
Phylogenetic Relationships among California Grylloblatta

Previous phylogenetic analysis [39] demonstrated that
North American Grylloblatta are monophyletic and
derived from a northeast Asian grylloblattid ancestor, and
that Grylloblatta was split into two deeply divergent lineages occupying the northern Cascades and southern

Oregon-California. By increasing the taxonomic and spatial sampling of Grylloblatta in California, our analysis
reveals a deep split in the Sierra Nevada with a high
degree of local geographic subdivision. Both Bayesian
and maximum likelihood methods identify a basal polytomy of three major lineages. These lineages include an
Oregon Cave lineage, a northeastern California lineage,

and a Sierra Nevada lineage. A fourth lineage is identified
in the maximum likelihood analysis, comprised of southern Cascades G. rothi and northern Californian G. barberi, but is alternatively nested in the Sierra Nevada
lineage in the Bayesian analysis. This conflict might result
from differences in methodological assumptions and/or
long-branch effects. All currently recognized species in

California form discrete monophyletic groups and correspond to subclades within the major lineages. The northeastern California lineage includes G. gurneyi and G.
chandleri. The northern Sierra Nevada clade includes G.
bifratrilecta and G. washoa. The monophyly of these
groups indicates that morphological criteria have been
useful in delineating distinct evolutionary lineages. However, other monophyletic groups of similar levels of
genetic divergence are present in the Sierra Nevada,
including populations along the Tioga Crest, the southwest Sierra, and the central Sierra. Several other specimens from unique low elevation sites (Ostrander Lake
and Lillburn Cave) are highly divergent from and sister to
alpine subclades. Finally, one specimen collected at
Graveyard Lakes is genetically distinct, with unique
alleles at all loci (unshared by 12 other individuals at that
site). This specimen may represent a sympatric population that has come into contact but is reproductively isolated from the Central Sierra Nevada lineage. Most of the
Sierra Nevada populations sampled in our study represent new localities and several monophyletic clades may
represent undescribed species.
Biogeographic Patterns of Lineage Diversification

The diversification of grylloblattids in North America has
taken place over a large geographic region that has experienced a complex geological and climatic history [1].
Despite dramatic environmental events, including periodic volcanic eruptions, Grylloblatta have managed to
persist and recolonize alpine habitats [40]. They are currently found in small, relictual populations where local

Page 8 of 14

microenvironments provide cold temperature retreats.
The major division of North American Grylloblatta
occurs between a northern Cascades-Rocky Mountain
clade and a California-Southern Oregon clade [39]. This
provides little information about the geographic origin of
Californian taxa, but indicates that a common ancestor
diversified across western North America in the distant
past. Furthermore, a basal polytomy in our phylogenetic
analysis leaves the relationship of major California lineages unresolved. The Oregon Cave lineage is isolated in
the lower slopes of the Siskiyou Mountains, which stretch
south into the California Trinity Alps and Mount Shasta
region. This population is at the southern end of the Cascades Range and represents the most likely source of colonization into California. However, the unusual
relationship and placement of G. rothi and G. barberi suggests that there may have been multiple dispersal events
between Oregon and California, perhaps utilizing other
biogeographic corridors.
Relationships of the remaining California taxa are particularly interesting, because these species are a mix of
low elevation relict populations and alpine populations.
Kamp [34] proposed that taxa in northeastern California
were relicts of populations broadly distributed in periglacial habitat during glacial periods. The geographical location of widely separated populations of G. chandleri
supports this hypothesis, as these populations lie within
the periglacial zone of Mt. Lassen. G. chandleri and G.
gurneyi form a highly divergent monophyletic group in
northeastern California, suggesting that these low elevation populations have been isolated for a long period of
time. Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor, based on
fossil-derived substitution rates, suggests diversification
within these species (~239,600 years B.P. for G. chandleri
and ~139,600 for G. gurneyi) was initiated during the
early stages of glacial cooling phases [41]. Other low elevation populations in our study, including G. barberi,
Ostrander Lake, and Lillburn Cave, are distinct from and
sister to alpine lineages. These taxa do not appear to be
recent remnant populations of alpine populations that
moved down-slope during glacial periods, but instead
seem to share ancestry with populations that gave rise to
alpine lineages. All populations in the Sierra Nevada
share a single common ancestor, suggesting one dispersal
event gave rise to a diverse group of alpine lineages.
Within the alpine lineages, there is a high degree of
substructure reflecting the dispersal limitation of populations and, perhaps, the existence of geographical barriers.
Some subclades (Central Sierra Nevada, Southwest Sierra
Nevada, G. barberi, Tioga Crest) have unique mitochondrial haplotypes at all geographical localities sampled, but
other well-sampled populations (i.e. G. washoa) have
shared haplotypes across sites. Current sampling does
not clearly elucidate whether nunataks (ice-free high ele-

vation habitat) were important in the persistence of
alpine populations and the preservation of genetic variation. It is clear that alpine populations are subdivided
north to south, with unique lineages occupying major
drainage basins. These drainages were the principal
course of alpine glacial growth and it is probable that
Grylloblatta populations tracked suitable habitat along
the periglacial edge environment of these growing glaciers. The White Mountains, lying east of the Sierra
Nevada at the edge of the Great Basin, has a population of
Grylloblatta closely related to Central Sierra Nevada populations. Currently, a distance of roughly 30 miles separates the two ranges in the Long Valley region (elevation
>2,125 m). Historically, a high plateau connected these
mountain ranges, but subsidence along the Owens Valley
fault (beginning 3 million years ago and reaching its present state around 300,000 years ago) separated high elevation habitat of both mountain ranges [42,43]. Our dating
analysis suggests that Grylloblatta populations from the

White Mountains (TMRCA median estimate ~179,800, 95%
CI 17,320-505,900) may have been isolated during this
period of subsidence. These are the first data to suggest
multiple refugia existed in the Sierra Nevada, and on both
sides of the crest, during glacial phases.
Evolutionary History of Alpine Endemics

Grylloblatta lineages, clades and subclades in California
are characterized by broadly overlapping periods of
diversification. Using unscaled relaxed clock methods,
median estimates of TMRCA reveal pulses at multiple
nested levels in the phylogeny. However there is inherent
error in these estimates and a lineage through time plot
does not show synchronous pulses of diversification.
Instead, the lineage through time analysis shows a high
early diversification rate, a pronounced decline, and a
very recent recovery in Grylloblatta diversification. The
calibrated molecular clock rate places diversification
times within Sierra Nevada Grylloblatta lineages during

Schoville and Roderick BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:163
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/163

the Pleistocene glacial stages. Although some median
estimates are in accord with specific events in the glacial
chronology in the Sierra Nevada, confidence intervals are
broad and overlap glacial-interglacial cycles. For example,
median age estimates of within-population variation in
alpine populations is ~150,000 years B.P., during the glacial maximum of the Illinoian advance, which was followed by an interglacial warm phase [23], but confidence
intervals include the most recent glacial maximum
(~25,000 years B.P.). Hence, the inherent uncertainty in
the timing of diversification does not provide clear resolution to whether grylloblattid populations diversify during glacial advances or, alternatively, diversify during the
retreat of alpine glaciers. Population genetic statistical
tests provide equivocal support for recent population
expansion in several well-sampled alpine Grylloblatta
populations, although this may be an artifact of limited
sample sizes. Furthermore, glacial phases in the Sierra
Nevada are known to involve multiple glacial advances
and retreats [44], which caused dynamic shifts in vegetation over short periods of time [23,45]. The pace and
scale of such changes may not have favored periods of
stable growth in Grylloblatta populations.
An older period of lineage diversification, corresponding to the TMRCA of recognized morphological species,
dates to ~700,000-1,000,000 years B.P., well within the
Middle Pleistocene epoch. Morphological criteria for distinguishing these species involve differences in male and
female reproductive morphology, as well as differences in
sensory structures and body size attributes. Changes in
reproductive morphology are known to impede reproductive compatibility in insects [46], which suggests that
multiple alpine Grylloblatta lineages have undergone
recent speciation. The TMRCA of all California and all
Sierra Nevada populations (~3.9-4.5 MYA) predates the
Pleistocene. This suggests that Grylloblatta species may
have colonized California during glacial advances of Pliocene epoch. It is likely that climatic oscillations led to the
formation of discrete genetic populations, morphologically distinguishable taxa [47,48], and the first dispersal
event into the Sierra Nevada during the evolution of California Grylloblatta.

Conclusions
Recent speciation and the formation of multiple endemic
lineages may be a common feature of alpine landscapes.
This has been shown repeatedly in alpine taxa, as demonstrated in examples of North American grasshoppers
[49], New Zealand plants and insects [50], and European
plants [51]. These studies provide evidence that Pleistocene climate change has acted as a species pump [52] in
alpine environments. California Grylloblatta provide an

example of lineage diversification during glacial expansion events on a very small geographical scale. This highlights the importance of multiple refugia in mountains as
sources of contemporary genetic variation in alpine species.

Methods
Genetic sampling

Sampling was done between 2005 and 2008 throughout
California, with a particular focus on alpine populations
in the Sierra Nevada. Despite systematic efforts to sample
Grylloblatta [[34,53]; Schoville, S.D. unpublished data,
[54]], populations are highly fragmented and local population densities appear to be low. Genetic samples comprise thirty sites and a total of 134 individuals (Figure 1;
Additional file 1 Table 1S; Additional file 2 Table 2S). The
majority of populations sampled are new locality records,
including most Sierra Nevada collecting sites. Relevant
genetic samples were taken from Jarvis and Whiting [39],
including four California sites and two sites from Oregon.
An individual of Grylloblatta from Oregon Cave, Oregon
is used as an out-group based on the phylogenetic results
of Jarvis and Whiting [39]. When possible, individuals
were assigned to species based on previous phylogenetic
hypotheses [34,39] and using morphological criteria
[47,48,55], but populations from new sites within the
Sierra Nevada have not been assigned to previously
described species. All specimens have been deposited in
the Essig Museum of Entomology, University of California, Berkeley.
Molecular techniques and data preparation

Genomic DNA was extracted from 1-2 legs of each individual with a Qiagen DNEasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) with reduced elution volumes. To maintain
consistency with previously collected datasets [39],
genetic data were collected from one mitochondrial and
three nuclear genes. A region of approximately 790 bp
representing the entire mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) gene was amplified and sequenced
in both directions with the primers COII-F-Leucine and
COII-R-Lysine [56]. Three nuclear genes were also amplified, including histone (H3) and the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal genes. A 380 bp region of the histone gene was
amplified and sequenced in both directions using the
primers HexA-F and HexA-R [56]. 2,100 bp of 18 S and
2,450 bp of 28 S were amplified using several overlapping
primer combinations [57]. PCR products were sequenced
in both directions on an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer
using Big Dye v3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems).
DNA sequences were manually edited using the program SEQUENCHER v4.8 (Gene Codes Corporation).
Some individuals were heterozygous at histone (H3) and

Schoville and Roderick BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:163
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/163

haplotypes phase was estimated using the program
PHASE v2 [58]. Visual alignments were made for each
gene in the program MACLADE v4.08 [59]. Gaps were
evident in both 18 S and 28 S and these were retained in
subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
Population Genetic Analysis of Alpine Populations

Changes in demographic history are known to affect the
frequency of alleles, the distribution of mutations, and
the coalescent times of gene copies. Population summary
statistics examine genetic variability within populations
and can be used to test for departures from demographic
equilibrium. Statistical tests using Tajima's D, Fu's FS, and
the mismatch distribution SSD and Raggedness Index
were calculated in ARLEQUIN v3.11 [60]. The D and FS
neutrality tests are sensitive to changes in demography or
selection [61,62]. Significant negative values indicate
population growth or purifying expansion, while significant positive values indicate population bottlenecks or
balancing selection. Mismatch distributions model the
frequency distribution of pairwise differences in a sudden
population expansion [63], as well as under a spatial population expansion model [64,65]. Significant SSD or Raggedness Index values indicate that an expansion model is
rejected by the data. Although most of the Grylloblatta
sample sites have too few individuals to calculate population genetic summary statistics, five alpine localities contain sample sizes of greater than ten individuals (Barker
Pass, Susie Lake, Sonora Pass, White Mountains and
Graveyard Lakes). Each of the summary statistics was calculated for COII and histone in these five localities. Significance values for all four statistical tests were
calculated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Phylogenetic Analysis

Phylogenetic relationships of California Grylloblatta
were estimated using an unrooted Bayesian method and a
maximum likelihood bootstrapping method. The four
genes were concatenated and partitioned in each analysis.
COII was further partitioned by codon position.
MRMODELTEST2 v2.3 [66] was used to estimate models
of molecular evolution for each partition. Based on
Akaike Information Criteria [AIC, [67]], the best models
for each partition were: COIIpos1 GTR+G+I, COIIpos2
GTR+I, COIIpos3 GTR+G+I, histone HKY+I, 18 S GTR+I,
and 28 S GTR+I. Histone was not partitioned by codon
due to the lack of variable sites at first and second codon
positions.
The program MRBAYES v3.1.2 [68] was used to estimate a Bayesian phylogeny of the concatenated and partitioned dataset (n = 87). Polymorphic sites at nuclear
genes were treated as base ambiguities. Two independent
analyses were run under the following conditions: 15 million steps, four chains, and genealogies sampled every

Page 11 of 14

1000 steps. Performance of the Monte Carlo Markov
Chain simulations was assessed for convergence using
AWTY [69]. The first 4,000 samples were discarded as
burn-in samples and a 50% majority rule consensus tree
of the two independent runs was produced with posterior
probability values equal to bipartition frequencies. A
maximum-likelihood tree was also estimated using a
rapid bootstrap heuristic in RAxML v7.0.4 [70]. A single
run was conducted with 1000 bootstrap replicates followed by a full maximum likelihood search, using the
partitioned data with the GTR+G+I model selected for
each partition and the Oregon Cave sample selected as an
out-group. Additionally, an mtDNA gene tree and a concatenated nuclear gene tree were estimated using
MRBAYES with the following conditions: data partitioned by codon, two separate runs of 20 million steps
each, four chains, and genealogies sampled every 1000
steps. The first 5,000 samples were discarded as burn-in
samples and a 50% majority rule consensus tree of the
two runs was produced with posterior probability values
equal to bipartition frequencies.
The concatenated phylogeny was plotted on a digital
elevation base map of North American using GENGIS
v.1.05 [71].
Timing of Lineage Diversification

Coalescent theory can be used to estimate the age of a
monophyletic lineage by calculating the time to most
recent common ancestor (TMRCA). This approach was
used to calculate the age of the Grylloblatta lineages, as
well as the time to a most recent common ancestor of sister clades. The estimation of absolute ages requires translation of molecular substitution rates into average rates
per year. These rates cannot currently be estimated using
fossil calibration because no there are no known fossils
within the extant Grylloblattidae or of recent ancestral
stem groups [72]. Mitochondrial substitution rates are
available from fossil-based studies of other insect lineages
[73,74]. These studies have shown a convergence in cytochrome oxidase subunit I mutation rates at 1.5% per million years. Molecular substitution rates are similar
between cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome
oxidase subunit II in insects, and the same rate is often
applied to both genes [e.g [75,76]].
In order to explicitly address the uncertainty in using
imported substitution rates, a relaxed clock model was
selected for a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis in BEAST
v1.5.3 [77,78]. Under this model, substitution rates are
allowed to vary within a lineage and across lineages
within the dataset under the constraints of a prior distribution. Two alternative priors were chosen to explore the
divergence time of California Grylloblatta. First, the
mean rate of evolution across the whole tree fixed to a
mean of 1 in order to provide unscaled TMRCA estimates

Schoville and Roderick BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:163

Page 12 of 14

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/163

[78]. Second, a mean substitution rate estimate of 1.5%
per million years was applied to COII. Uncertainty was
added to the substitution rate by setting the standard
deviation to 0.5% (mean = 0.015, 95% interval range:
0.00678 to 0.0232 per million years). The multi-locus
dataset was partitioned by gene using the following substitution models: COII GTR+G+I, histone HKY+I, 18 S
GTR+I, and 28 S GTR+I. The relaxed clock model with
an uncorrelated log-normal distribution was chosen as a
prior for rate variation among lineages and the Yule speciation process was chosen as a tree prior. Independent
analyses were conducted under the following conditions:
100 million steps, genealogies sampled every 1000 steps,
and a burn-in period of 10 million steps. Median estimates of time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA)
and 95% confidence intervals were calculated within the
phylogeny using TRACER v1.5.
Lineage through time plots were constructed using the
unscaled ultrametric phylogeny from the relaxed clock
analysis. The library APE [79] in the software R v2.10.1
[80] was used to plot log-transformed lineage diversification versus time, relative to null model with a constant
rate of speciation.
