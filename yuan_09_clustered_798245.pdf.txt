Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a growing class of small RNAs with crucial regulatory roles
at the post-transcriptional level, are usually found to be clustered on chromosomes. However, with
the exception of a few individual cases, so far little is known about the functional consequence of
this conserved clustering of miRNA loci. In animal genomes such clusters often contain nonhomologous miRNA genes. One hypothesis to explain this heterogeneity suggests that clustered
miRNAs are functionally related by virtue of co-targeting downstream pathways.
Results: Integrating of miRNA cluster information with protein protein interaction (PPI) network
data, our research supports the hypothesis of the functional coordination of clustered miRNAs and
links it to the topological features of miRNAs' targets in PPI network. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that clustered miRNAs jointly regulate proteins in close proximity of the PPI network.
The possibility that two proteins yield to this coordinated regulation is negatively correlated with
their distance in PPI network. Guided by the knowledge of this preference, we found several
network communities enriched with target genes of miRNA clusters. In addition, our results
demonstrate that the variance of this propensity can also partly be explained by protein's
connectivity and miRNA's conservation.
Conclusion: In summary, this work supports the hypothesis of intra-cluster coordination and
investigates the extent of this coordination.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (22 nt) single-stranded
non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules. They are processed
from hairpin precursors of approximately 70 nt (pre-miRNAs), which in turn are extracted from primary transcripts
(pri-miRNA) [1,2]. miRNAs can repress gene expression
post-transcriptionally by binding to the 3' untranslated

regions (3' UTRs) of their target mRNAs [3-5]. In animal
genomes, miRNAs are found in various genomic locations; while most are located in intergenic regions, some
are found to be hosted within the introns of pre-mRNAs
or within longer ncRNA genes [6,7]. Interestingly, known
miRNA genes, both hosted and non-hosted, are often
observed to be clustered [8]. A cluster usually includes two

or three miRNA genes, but larger clusters have also been
identified, including a human mir-17 cluster comprising 6
miRNA genes and a human mir-302 cluster comprising 8
miRNA genes. Baskerville and Bartel found that miRNAs
within 50 Kb are highly correlated in expression across 24
different human organs, indicating that 50 Kb might be
used as preliminary definition for miRNA cluster [9].
Although miRNAs in a given cluster are usually phylogenetically related in sequence, many human clusters containing miRNAs without apparent sequence homology
are also found [10]. A plausible but yet-to-be validated
possibility is that the clustered miRNAs are functionally
related by virtue of targeting the same gene or different
genes in the same pathway [8,10-12]. Studies of individual cases have to some extent supported this hypothesis.
For instance, mir-15a-16 cluster act as tumor suppressor
genes in prostate cancer by controlling cell survival, proliferation and invasion [13]. In gastric cancer, mir-106b
cluster and mir-222 cluster are upregulated and modulate
cell cycle by targeting the Cip/Kip family proteins [14].
The frequently studied mir-17-92 cluster acts not only in
tumor formation but also in development of heart, lungs,
and immune system [15-18]. Three individual miRNAs of
the mir-379-410 cluster are required for activity-dependent development of hippocampal neurons [19]. mir-48
and mir-241 of a let-7 family cluster function together to
regulate developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans
[20]. However, apart from these individual cases, the
hypothesis has not yet been systematically investigated.
Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the conservation and functional consequence of miRNA clustering.
We show that clustered miRNAs have functional relatedness through co-targeting proteins in close proximity of
PPI network.

Results
MiRNA clusters' construction and property
It has been reported that clusters may contain unrelated
miRNAs [21,22]. But the frequency of such heterogeneity
has not been comprehensively evaluated. Prior research
[10] has identified the clustering of 326 registered human
miRNA genes, using the strategy proposed by Altuvia et al.
[23]. According to miRBase [24], the number of registered
miRNA genes has doubled. Still more homologs of the
known miRNAs are expected in human genome, especially when more and more miRNA genes derived from
TEs (transcriptional elements) have recently been identified [25-27].

In order to analyze the genomic clustering of miRNAs as
systematically and exhaustively as possible, we conducted
a cross-species Blast search of known pre-miRNA
sequences in the entire human, mouse and rat genomes.
In rat genome we found 152 novel miRNA loci that are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/65

homologues of previously annotated human or mouse
miRNAs, whereas the corresponding numbers of loci in
the mouse and human genomes are 33 and 19, respectively (see Additional File 1). We clustered miRNA genes
within 50 kb of each other according to Bartel et al. [9].
After filtering with RNA polymerase II promoter analysis
software and expression profiles (for details, see Material
and Methods), a total of 104 miRNA clusters representing
67 unique miRNA combinations have been identified in
human genome. Clusters composed of only hsa-mir-566
were not included, since hsa-mir-566 is thought to be
derived from repeat sequence Alu, which is pervasive in
the human genome [28]. Similarly, 91 clusters representing 64 unique miRNA combinations were found in mouse
(mmu-mir-680 excluded), and 56 miRNA clusters, all
unique, were identified in rat.
In recent releases of miRBase, similar miRNA precursors
are assembled into miRNA families (miFams) based on
computational analysis and manual inspection. miRNAs
in a family have been shown to be phylogenetically
related [29,30]. We further mapped the miRNAs in our
data to their families according to miRBase's assignment.
As results, 55 distinct miRNA clusters were identified at
family level in human genome, along with 51 in mouse,
and 42 in rat (see Additional File 2). After mapping to
families, 31 clusters have been found to be conserved
among the three species, which take up 56% in human,
61% in mouse and 74% in rat (see Additional File 3).
Approximately half of the identified clusters are composed of multiple miRNA families and are denoted as
miRNA hetero-cluster throughout this paper. On average,
a hetero-cluster contains three miRNA families, and
around half of the miRNA genes in a hetero-cluster do not
belong to the main family (Table 1). Additionally, even
miRNAs in the same family show sequence divergence
and possibly target different proteins. This cluster heterogeneity is unlikely to merely derive from random mutation and retention. The fact that these clusters have been
fixed in several modern animal genomes implies some
evolutionary advantages of such a miRNA gene organizaTable 1: Heterogeneity analysis of the miRNA clusters.

tion, which may provide an efficient internal mechanism
for them to function in coordination [8,12,31].
Functional Coordination on PPI network
Coordination among regulators from the transcriptional
and miRNA regulatory layers has recently drawn great
interests [32,33]. To reveal why non-homologous miRNAs are found in the same cluster, we analyzed their
potential coordination in the context of PPI networks.
Generally, the coordination of miRNAs in a cluster should
be analyzed directly through justifying the relative proximity between their targets in the network. However,
because of the incompleteness of credible PPI networks
(e.g. Human Protein Reference Database, HPRD) and the
low reliability of other integrated databases, we primarily
chose to reverse the procedure to analyze whether proteins in close proximity incline to be regulated by miRNAs
from the same cluster (henceforth referred to as "sc-miRNAs").

We first investigated directly interacting protein pairs. It
has recently been reported that interacting protein pairs
have a certain propensity to be regulated by the same
miRNA [34]. There may exist a similar tendency that two
interacting proteins are also regulated by sc-miRNAs. ScmiRNAs can fulfil the same function through a complementary approach – by assembling two non-related
miRNA loci in the same transcriptional unit. Before analysis, we prepare the data as follows:
We used HPRD as the golden standard positive (GSP,
interacting protein pairs) dataset, and the dataset generated by Rhodes et al. [35] according to protein subcellular
localization as the golden standard negative (GSN, noninteracting protein pairs) dataset. Comparisons of various
miRNA target prediction programs suggest that TargetScan could achieve both high sensitivity and specificity
[36,37]. We therefore employed TargetScan predictions
for clustered miRNAs. For targets of a miRNA family, common targets shared by all its miRNA members were used.
The number of miRNA sites is 9.7 ± 8.9 per transcript for
GSP, and 10.1 ± 9.4 for GSN. To specifically evaluate the
coordination among different miRNA families in a cluster, we constructed a family-represented version of heteroclusters by mapping miRNAs in a cluster to their families,
and then having redundancies removed (We will later
denote these clusters as family-represented hetero-clusters
and clusters before collapsing as original clusters). As a
result, the 53 hetero-clusters have been collapsed to 37
family-represented hetero-clusters. To curb possible bias
in the target prediction and isolate the effects of clustering,
a control was generated by randomly reshuffling miRNAs
(or families, when studying family-represented heteroclusters) among the clusters.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/65

Two measures were employed to assess sc-miRNAs' coordination: one measure is the number of clusters that regulate the two proteins, which reflects the strength of
coordination; the other is the percentage of protein pairs
that are regulated by sc-miRNAs, which reflects the range
of coordination. We calculated the prevalence of miRNAs'
coordination on the GSP and GSN datasets for real clusters and 1,000 random cluster sets. Interacting proteins
are found to have a significantly higher tendency to be coregulated by miRNAs from real than from randomly
organized clusters (Figure 1). This tendency towards coordinated regulation was not observed for the GSN dataset,
which justifies our study of sc-miRNAs' coordination in
the context of PPI network. The large coordination measurements detected in random cluster set might be due to:
1) considerable noise exists in current protein-protein
interaction data and miRNA target prediction; 2) when
reshuffling 95 miRNAs families (contains redundancies,
when a family appears in more than one cluster) in 37
hetero-clusters, there is a chance that two families in a real
cluster are assigned to a random cluster again; meanwhile,
miRNAs from the same family, which usually locate in
one or two clusters, were dispersed into more clusters in
randomization, and hence substantially increased the
number of clusters they coincided.
Since the interacting pairs demonstrate stronger propensity to be regulated by sc-miRNAs than non-interacting
pairs, we next asked whether there are some correlation
between the propensity and the distance between two
proteins in the network. The shortest paths were calculated between all the proteins in GSP dataset. We found a
significant negative correlation between the number of
clusters regulating the two proteins and the length of the
shortest path between them in the PPI network (Spearman's rank correlation, correlation coefficient Rs = -0.24,
P < 2.2e-16). This result suggests that distance in the PPI
network is an important factor with respect to the coordinated regulation from sc-miRNAs, and lend further support to our previous finding.
We have also noticed the great variance in the number of
clusters regulating an interacting protein pair. Still 50% of
the directly interacting protein pairs are not co-regulated
by miRNAs from same cluster, and the numbers of clusters that do regulate them vary from 1 to 14. Despite the
noises and data incompleteness, directly interacting pairs
are still likely to enjoy different levels of tendency. Therefore, we studied another factor, connectivity, that might
influence this propensity.
Connectivity, the number of neighbours, is one of the
most important properties of a protein node in a PPI network. In general, it quantitatively measures functional
complexity and importance of a protein node in the PPI

network. We counted all proteins' connectivity in HPRD
network. The connectivity of proteins in GSP is 15.7 ±
19.3, and in GSN 11.3 ± 17.6. We added up the connectivity of the two proteins in each pair and discovered a
positive correlation between connectivity sum and the
number of miRNA clusters targeting them in GSP (Spearman's rank correlation, correlation coefficient Rs = 0.11, P
= 3.136e-8, as detailed in Table 2). More interestingly, this
positive correlation is two times stronger in GSP than GSN
(Rs is only 0.06 in GSN-HC, which is close to a random
control). Considering the major difference between GSP
and GSN is that the shortest path is longer than 3 between
GSN proteins in HPRD network, this result indicates that
the sc-miRNAs preferentially act on protein pairs within
close proximity, rather than those with greater connectiv-

ity (importance) in PPI network. It may explain why coordination has mainly been reported in regulating
pathways.
To see whether these observations are robust, the same
analysis was performed with PicTar prediction set, the
overlap of TargetScan and PicTar prediction set as recommended by Sethupathy [36], as well as miRanda prediction set with alignment score greater than 155 (see
Additional File 4). They all gave very consistent results.
Modularity of the targets
A module in networks is a local structure characterized by
more internal than external links. Since our findings suggest that sc-miRNAs favour coordinated regulation of

local regions in PPI network, does sc-miRNAs' target gene
set demonstrate some modularity? Xu and Wong [38]
have found three miRNA clusters involved in regulating
15 signaling pathways by filtering mouse Biocarta pathway data. Pathway has been recognized as a common
form of modularity in network analysis. Here, we
explored another form of modularity, network community,
in sc-miRNAs' targets with respect to HPRD network.
Community structure in networks means the appearance
of densely connected groups of vertices, with only sparser
connections between groups [39]. We have found 32 network communities of size no less than 10 from HPRD network by joining cliques with size 3 to 7 together, using
CFinder 2.0 [40]. We selected those network communities
with at least 50% proteins targeted by a miRNA cluster
and at most 40% regulated by any member of the cluster
to guarantee that they are co-regulated by the cluster
rather than any single member. For the 8 communitycluster pairs we obtained, the P-value was calculated
based on the overlap of each community with the targets
of one thousand simulated miRNA clusters of the same
size. Finally, we obtained 5 community-cluster pairs with
P < 0.03 (FDR < 0.2, Table 3). Among them, mir-17 cluster's role in transcription regulation through this protein
community is well-known [41,42]. Xie et al. recently
reported mir-512 cluster's involvement in histone acetylation in embryonic stem cells [43]. Another interesting one
is mir-379 cluster. It targets a network community of ten
proteins that are involved in circadian rhythm (Figure 2).
Although there is no experimental report on it, circadian
rhythm is modulated by neural system while mir-379 cluster is brain-specific and is required for dendritogenesis
[19].
Although our work mainly focus on protein-protein interaction data, for it is more complete and more suitable for
global analysis, we re-ran our analysis with KEGG human
pathway data, and presented the results in Additional
File 4.

A network community of ten proteins is co-regulated
by four miRNA families in mir-379 cluster. This network community is involved in circadian rhythm [KEGG pathway:hsa04710] and is co-regulated by nine miRNAs (mir-494,
mir-543, mir-495, mir-381, mir-539, mir-668, mir-485, mir-496,
and mir-409) from four families in mir-379 cluster. We
mapped these miRNAs to their families for the simplicity of
illustration.

Coordination and conservation
Cluster provides a neat mechanism to transcribe many
cooperative miRNAs simultaneously. It could hardly be
imaged that this exquisite coordination has been generated in a single event; rather, it should have been consolidated through a long period of evolutionary process. To
investigate the relationship between coordination and
conservation, we have to calculate the target interactions
between miRNAs in a cluster.

A comparison between human, mouse and rat miRNA
clusters enables us to classify miRNAs in hetero-clusters
into two categories: one is conserved miRNAs, which are
observed in human, mouse and rat clusters; the other is
non-conserved miRNAs, which exist in human clusters
but are unobtainable in mouse or rat clusters. We counted
the target interactions irredundantly within and between

Discussion
Recently, global analysis of miRNA targets in the context
of sets of genes or PPI network has drawn great interests
[34,38,44-47]. It could also provide important insights
into how miRNAs in a cluster cooperate with each other.

Although results in previous section indicate that miRNAs
in a cluster may co-regulate proteins in close proximity of
PPI network, they provide no information on each
miRNA cluster's coordination. Here, those highly coordinated miRNA pairs (-lgP > 1.5), conserved and non-conserved, come from 17 (30.1%) hetero-clusters. We have
found literature support for the function of 15 of them, all

least 30% of the miRNA hetero-clusters we can find evidence in current HPRD network for their intra-cluster

relationship of miRNAs that target them. This perspective
has advantages in avoiding the incompleteness of proteinprotein interaction data, and allowing us to analyze miRNAs' functionality according to the features of their targets.

non-conserved miRNAs and conserved miRNAs. miRNA
pairs with targets overlapping more than 100 within
HPRD-recorded proteins were excluded because their
mature sequences are so similar as to be suspected of having identical function. We calculated the empirical Pvalue of each miRNA pair's number of target interactions
by 10,000 times randomization of miRNA-target protein
association. The negative logarithm of P-value (-lgP) was
then used to assess the coordination. The greater -lgP is,
the stronger the coordination is. As results, 33.3% of conserved miRNAs pairs have been found to cooperate significantly in regulating PPI network (-lgP > 1.5, FDR < 0.1),
which comports with our previous finding of intra-cluster
coordination. Coordination within non-conserved miRNAs, however, is much weaker than that within conserved
ones in a cluster (Figure 3, one-sided two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: D = 0.34, P = 1.38e-11). In other
words, conserved miRNAs are generally more cooperative
with each other than non-conserved ones in a cluster. The
result is consistent on miRanda target set.

are temporarily not needed, then their expressions should
be reduced simultaneously. miRNAs in a cluster transcribed as polycistron would provide a competent and
efficient mechanism to achieve this goal. Our further analysis reveals that connectivity is another factor that matters
only when proteins interact or are at least close in PPI network. Interacting proteins, both with great connectivity,
usually connect two functional protein groups. They
would be under stronger selective pressure to consent to a
miRNA cluster's regulation. If one of them was not regulated in time, the module it involved would likely be still
in function, and the coordination of the whole system
would be greatly impaired.
The finding that distance is more important than connectivity suggests that sc-miRNAs preferentially co-regulate
proteins in close proximity of a PPI network. However,
this may also be due to the fact that PPI network are
mainly gathered from high-throughput experiments
which focus on physical interactions, such as yeast two
hybrid system and tandem affinity purification. Therefore,
for two proteins with long distance in PPI network, even
their concurrence in time and space could not be guaranteed. To overcome this limitation, other information,
such as signaling network or transcriptional regulatory
network, would be needed [46,47].

subtle relationship.

Methods
Data sources
Datasets of PPI
Gold standard positive dataset: all the information in the
Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) has been
manually extracted from the literature by expert biologists
who read, interpret and analyze the published data. It
contains 38,167 distinct interactions among 9,465 proteins [48]. Our analysis focused exclusively on the giant
connected component of 9,134 proteins and 31,909 interactions. The remaining proteins were tiny clusters with
sizes between two and eight. According to TargetScan's
prediction, 8,264 of the 9,134 proteins are targeted by
miRNAs. 6,737 of them are targeted by clustered miRNAs,
and 4,835 are targeted by miRNAs that appear in heteroclusters.

Conclusion

Gold standard negative dataset: it was generated by
Rhodes et al. [35], which includes all possible pair-wise
combinations between two sets of proteins that are
assigned a subcellular localization of the plasma membrane (1,397 proteins) and the nucleus (2,224 proteins),
respectively, by the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium.
There are 2633 overlapping proteins between GSP and
GSN.

biological networks. The linkage of sc-miRNAs' functional

Rfam/mirna/, and blast them against the whole genome
of human, mouse and rat. Only the hits with 90% coverage and 90% identity were selected. All miRNA genes
whose Blast distance is smaller than 100 bp were treated
as one locus. According to Baskerville and Bartel [9], we
considered loci within 50 kb of each other as belonging to
the same cluster. miRNAs in a cluster were further
screened using following filters:RNA polymerase II filter:
Clusters were classified as intronic or intergenic according
to their hostages. miRNA genes located at the introns or
UTRs of protein-coding genes are transcribed together
with their host genes, whereas miRNA genes dispersed in
an intergenic region are generally believed to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II [49]. Therefore, we screened
the regions surrounding intergenic miRNA clusters using
the following RNA polymerase II promoter analysis software: Promoter Scan http://thr.cit.nih.gov/molbio/pros
can for predicting promoter regions based on scoring
homologies with putative eukaryotic Pol II promoter
sequences,
Promoter

sequences, and NNPP (neural network promoter prediction) http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html
for predicting eukaryotic Pol II promoter sequences.
Intronic miRNA clusters were directly reserved for transcription along with their host genes.
Expression profile filter
miRNAs in the clusters were also filtered according to
expressional correlation. Three expression profiles [5053] were used in the screening. Only miRNAs with a Pearson Correlation Coefficient higher than 0.3 were retained
in the cluster.
Quantification of the functional coordination
There are four possible ways two miRNAs in a cluster
could target a protein pair (Figure 4). Situation b, concerning the propensity of two interacting proteins to be
regulated by the same miRNA, regardless of miRNA clustering, has already be studied by Liang and Li [34]. In our
analysis, we therefore excluded this situation. Situation c
and d could be caused by the sequence homology of these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/65

two miRNAs, whose target sets hence greatly overlap,
rather than true coordination. To eliminate the influence
of sequence homology, we specifically measured the coordination among different miRNA families, where
sequence homology is limited. We constructed a familyrepresented version of hetero-clusters by mapping miRNAs in a cluster to their families, and having redundancies
removed. We separately performed the computation with
family-represented hetero-clusters, and employed randomization as control.
Randomized Control
In our research, we have performed two types of randomization to construct control set: one is randomization of
miRNA clusters. To obtain random controls for testing the
propensity of interacting proteins to be regulated by scmiRNAs, we generated a cluster set by randomly shuffling
miRNAs among clusters, while keeping the size of each
cluster unchanged. The other is randomization of miRNAtarget protein associations. To obtain random controls for
testing the proximity of sc-miRNAs' targets, we generated
targets for each miRNA by randomly shuffling the
miRNA-target protein associations, while keeping
unchanged the number of proteins that a miRNA targets.
The empirical P-value for target interactions was calculated against 10,000 independent randomized samples.
The negative logarithm of P-value (-lgP) was then used to
assess the coordination. The greater -lgP is, the stronger
the coordination is.
Others
All the statistical tests and kernel density estimation were
done in R. Connectivity and the shortest paths between
each protein were calculated using iGraph package http://
cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph/.
