Abstract
A metagenomic library was prepared using pCC2FOS vector containing about 3.0 Gbp of
community DNA from the microbial assemblage of activated sludge. Screening of a part of the unamplified library resulted in the finding of 1 unique lipolytic clone capable of hydrolyzing tributyrin,
in which an esterase gene was identified. This esterase/lipase gene consists of 834 bp and encodes
a polypeptide (designated EstAS) of 277 amino acid residuals with a molecular mass of 31 kDa.
Sequence analysis indicated that it showed 33% and 31% amino acid identity to esterase/lipase from
Gemmata obscuriglobus UQM 2246 (ZP_02733109) and Yarrowia lipolytica CLIB122 (XP_504639),
respectively; and several conserved regions were identified, including the putative active site,
HSMGG, a catalytic triad (Ser92, His125 and Asp216) and a LHYFRG conserved motif. The EstAS
was overexpressed, purified and shown to hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl (NP) esters of fatty acids with
short chain lengths (≤ C8). This EstAS had optimal temperature and pH at 35°C and 9.0,
respectively, by hydrolysis of p-NP hexanoate. It also exhibited the same level of stability over wide
temperature and pH ranges and in the presence of metal ions or detergents. The high level of
stability of esterase EstAS with its unique substrate specificities make itself highly useful for
biotechnological applications.

Introduction
Lipolytic enzymes such as esterases (EC3.1.1.1) and
lipases (EC3.1.1.3) catalyze both the fat hydrolysis and
the synthesis of fatty acid esters including acylglycerides as
biocatalysts [1]. Lipolytic enzymes are ubiquitous α/β
hydrolyzing enzymes existed in animals, plants, and
microbes, including fungi and bacteria. Microbial esterases are showing considerable industrial potential where
their regiospecificity and enantioselectivity are desired
characteristics [2], such as production of fine chemicals,

pharmaceuticals, in the food industry and are widely used
in biotechnology [2-4].
Modern biotechnology has a steadily increasing demand
for novel biocatalysts, thereby prompting the development of novel experimental approaches to find and identify novel biocatalyst-encoding genes. Metagenome is the
total microbial genome directly isolated from natural
environments, and the power of metagenomics is the
access, without prior sequence information, to the so far

uncultured majority, which is estimated to be more than
99% of the prokaryotic organisms [5-7]. In fact, the
metagenomic approach was successful in searching for
novel lipolytic enzymes in varied environments, and also,
several genes encoding metagenomic esterases have been
identified in metagenomic libraries prepared from varied
environmental samples, including soils [6-9], marine sediment [10-12], pond and lake water [13-15], and tidal flat
sediment [16].

DNA preparation and manipulation
E. coli cells were transformed by the calcium chloride procedure [17]. Recombinant plasmid DNA was isolated by
the method of Birnboim and Doly [18] or with a Tianprep Mini kit (TianGen). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA
ligase and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, USA) or
Takara (Tokyo, Japan) and used according to the manufacturers' instructions.

Studies based on 16S rDNA library have extensively redefined and expanded our knowledge of microbial diversity
in activated sludge from low-temperature aromatic wastewater treatment bioreactor, including members of various
un-culturable groups (unpublished data). To the best of
our knowledge, activated sludge microbial communities
have not been exploited by culture-independent methods
for isolation of lipolytic genes. Here, we report the isolation, sequence analysis, and enzymatic characterization of
a novel esterase, EstAS, from an activated sludge derived
metagenomic library. The discovery of EstAS led to the
identification of a new family of bacterial lipolytic
enzymes.

Construction of metagenomic DNA library and sublibrary
Activated sludge DNA extraction was carried out using
SDS and proteinase K treatment [19], and the removal of
humic acids (HAs) prior to DNA extraction was conducted by using HAs removing buffer [20]. Approximately
100 μg of metagenomic DNA was run on a preparative
pulsed-field gel (Bio-Rad CHEF DR®III; 0.1-40 s switch
time, 6 V/cm, 0.5 × TBE buffer, 120° included angle, 16
h), and the appropriate size of DNA ranging from 30-50
kb was isolated, electroeluted, and dialyzed against 0.5 ×
TE buffer for further Fosmid library construction. The
purified DNA fragments were end-repaired by Endrepaired enzyme mix. After size fractionation and purification, the blunt-ended, 5'-phosphorylated DNA was
ligated into the cloning-ready Copycontrol pCC2FOS vector, and the recombinant molecules were packaged in vitro
with a MaxPlaxTM Lambda packaging kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The selected
unique fosmid clone was named FosB12L1 (showing
strong lipolytic activity on tributyrin plate), and purified,
partially digested with Sau 3AI to obtain 3-5 kb size DNA,
and ligated into a purified Bam HI/BAP pUC118 vector
from Takara. Ligation products were transformed into E.
coli TOP10 cells (Tiangen) and spread out on LB (ampicillin, 100 μg/ml) plates containing 1% (v/v) tributyrin as
the indicator substrate [21].

Identification of lipolytic clones and DNA sequence
analysis
The DNA fragment obtained was sequenced with primer
walking method by SinoGenoMax Co. Ltd (Chinese
National Human Genome Center, Beijing). The ORFs
were analyzed using DNAstar (Lynnon Biosoft) and GeneTool software (Syngene), Database searches were performed with the BLAST program via GenomeNet World
Wide Web server. Peptide sequences of various enzymes
or subunits were extracted from National Center for Biotechnology Information (Washington, D.C).
Phylogenetic analysis
Deduced amino acid sequences of 8 lipolytic enzymes
were subjected to protein phylogenetic analysis. Sequence
alignment was performed by using CLUSTAL_W program
[23] and visually examined with BoxShade Server program. Phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor
joining method of Saitou and Nei [22] with MEGA 4.0
software [24].
Protein expression and purification
For the overexpression of EstAS, the full length of the estAS
gene was amplified using primers EstAS-f and EstAS-r
(Table 2) and high fidelity PrimeSTAR™HS DNA Polymerase (code: DR010SA, Takara). The primer pairs with
restriction enzyme sites (underlined) for Hind III and Nde
I were designed to generate an N-terminal His-tag of the
recombinant esterase. The integrity of the nucleotide
sequence of all newly constructed plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The EstAS gene was cloned
into an expression vector, pET28a(+), and the recombinant plasmid pEstAS-His was transformed into E. coli
BL21 (DE3) cells. When the cell density at 600 nm
reached around 0.6, 1 mM isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside
was added for the induction, following a further cultivation for 4 h at 30°C. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a 50 mM sodium phosphate
buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mM imidazole, and dis-

rupted by sonication. The protein was applied to metalchelating chromatography using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was
carried out according to Sambrook and Russell [17].
Characterization and biochemical properties of EstAS
The substrate specificity of the purified enzyme was analyzed using the following substrates of p-NP-fatty acyl
esters [21,25]: acetate (C2), butyrate (C4), hexanoate
(C6), caprylate (C8), decanonate (C10), laurate (C12),
myristate (C14) and palmitate (C16). The enzyme was
incubated with the ester derivatives (0.5 mM) in 5 ml TrisHCl buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) at 40°C for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 5 ml trichloroacetic acid
(0.5 mM) and then recovered the original pH value with
5.15 ml NaOH (0.5 mM), and the amount of released pNP was determined by an absorption increase at 405 nm
against an enzyme-free blank on a Biospec-1601 spectrophotometer [26,27]. One unit of esterase is defined as the
amount needed to release 1 μmol p-NP per min under the
above conditions. The highest enzyme activity on a substrate (i. e. p-NP-hexanoate) was defined as 100%. To
determine the presence of esterase activity, the triglyceride
derivative 1,2-di-O-lauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid 6'methylresorufin ester (DGGR) (Sigma Aldrich) was used
as a chromogenic substrate, and the formation of methyresorufin was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 580
nm [1,28,29]. Candida rugosa lipase (Sigma Aldrich) was
used as a positive control.

Using p-NP-hexanoate (0.5 mM) as substrate, the optimal
temperature and pH of purified EstAS was determined, by
measuring the enzyme activity after incubation at various
temperatures (10-65°C) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH
8.0) or after incubation at 35°C for 10 min in the following buffers: 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.0-7.5), 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0-10.5).

Various metal ions (CoCl2, CaCl2, ZnCl2, MgCl2, K2SO4,
FeSO4, CuSO4, Ni(NO3)2 and MnSO4), and chelating
agent EDTA at final concentration of 1 mM were added to
the enzyme in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), then assayed for
esterase activity after preincubation at 35°C. Effect of
detergents or reductors on esterase activity was determined by incubating the enzyme for 30 min at 35°C in 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing (1%, v/v) Triton X100, Tween 20 and 80, β-mercaptoethanol, 1, 4-dithiothreitol (DTT), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethyl
ammonium bromide (CTAB), phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF) and diethypyrocarbonate (DEPC),
respectively. The enzyme activity without metal ions and
detergents was defined as 100%.

tity), the putative lipase/esterase from Magnaporthe grisea
70-15 and Saccharomyces cerevisiase Tg12p (XP_368471,
31% identity; and NP_010343, 29% identity, respectively), members of the family of fungal hydrolases. And
also, the EstAS contained a catalytic triad (Ser92, His125,
and Asp249) and a LHYFRG conserved motif (starting
from His36), as shown in Fig. 1, which is in close proximity to the active site contributing to the formation of the
oxyanion hole that is likely to participate directly in the
catalytic process [2,30,31]. Furthermore, to clarify the
phylogenetic relationship of the EstAS with other esterases
or lipases, a neighbour joining tree was constructed using
the amino acid sequence, as shown in Fig. 2. In this tree,
EstAS is located closest to the branch of esterase/lipase
(accession number X53053) of strain Moraxella sp. TA144,
and also Streptomyces sp. M11, Streptomyces albus G (accession numbers M86351 and U03114, respectively), which
constitute family III lipases. This result might suggest that
the EstAS is a new member of family III lipases.

Results and discussion
Construction of a metagenomic library and screening
About 100 μg DNA was extracted from 1 g activated
sludge (wet-weight), and 1.5 μg of size-selected, pulsefield gel-purified high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA
suitable for fosmid cloning was obtained. 300 ng of 30-45
kb purified metagenomic DNA was ligated into the copy
control pCC2FOS vector and transfected into E. coli
EPI300-T1R, producing a metagenomic library of more
than 100, 000 fosmids with insert sizes ranging from 28
kb to 40 kb (average size of 35 kb), covering approximately 3.0 Gbp of the total metagenomic DNA. The
prokaryotic origin of the library was confirmed by endsequencing of randomly selected fosmids and comparison with known ORFs in NCBI. Expression screening of
the fosmid library based on the hydrolysis of emulsified
tributyrin (1%) resulted in the detection of a recombinant
clone, FosB12L1, forming a clear zone on the indicator
plate.
Subcloning and identification of the esterase
The DNA insert (36 kb) of fosmid B12L1 was partial
digested by Sau 3AI and subcloned into pUC118, producing a subclone library of more than 3,000 clones with an
average insert size of 3-5 kb. 300 subclones were screened
for lipolytic activity. One subclone expressing extracellular lipase/esterase activity was sequenced and assembled
into a contig of 3780 bp (data not shown). An ORF of 834
bp encoding a putative lipase/esterase (named EstAS) of
277 amino acid residuals was identified. Amino acid
sequence alignment indicated that this EstAS showed
quite low identity with other esterase/lipases, highest with
the esterase/lipase from Gemmata obscuriglobus UQM 2246
(ZP_02733109, 33% identity), followed by the lipase
from Yarrowia lipolytica CLIB122 (XP_504639, 31% iden-

Expression and purification of recombinant EstAS
To investigate the property of this EstAS, EstAS gene was
expressed as an N-terminal His-tag fusion protein using
pET-28a(+) expression system in E. coli BL21(DE3). SDSPAGE analysis of the purified EstAS showed a single band
corresponding to about 31 kDa (Fig. 3), quite agreement
with the predicted full length of EstAS. The purity of the
purified protein was more than 98% according to SDSPAGE analysis.
Substrate specificity of EstAS
We expressed EstAS as a hexahistidine-tagged (Histagged) protein and investigated its chain length specificity using p-nitrophenyl esters (Sigma). EstAS showed
high activity towards short-chain fatty acids (C4, C6 and
C8), while much lower towards long-chain fatty acids
(>C8) (Fig. 4). In addition, EstAS showed no fluorescence
on olive oil plates with rhodamine B. Moreover, the EstAS
was not able to hydrolyse DGGR (data not shown), while
the lipase from Candida rugosa (used as a positive control)
was able to hydrolyse DGGR to form chromogenic product, methylresorufin. These results indicate that EstAS is
an esterase but a lipase [1,25,32,33].
Effect of temperature and pH on EstAS
Purified esterase EstAS showed a broader temperature
range (optimum at 35°C) than other original esterases,
and retained over 65% activity at 60°C (Fig. 5). The esterase YlLip2 from Yarrowia lipolytica showed an optimum
temperature at 40°C [34], however, it showed a poor thermostability since it lost activity just only incubation at
45°C for 4h. And also, the esterase EstAS showed activity
in a rather broad pH range of 5.5-10.5. Maximal activity

was observed at pH 9.0 and nearly 23% was still left at pH
10.5 (Fig. 6).
Effect of metal ions on esterase EstAS
The effect of metal ions on esterase EstAS activity is
depicted in Table 3. Among metal ions tested, the activity
was slightly increased by Co2+ (117%), Zn2+ (114%) and
Fe2+ (103%), and strongly promoted by 1 mM Mn2+
(190%), in comparison with the control. However, it was

a bit inhibited by Mg2+ and Ni2+ and almost totally inhibited by Cu2+ (7% residual activity). The fact that its activity
was not affected by the chelating agent EDTA might suggest that this esterase is not a metalloenzyme. These
results indicated that divalent metal ions, especially Mn2+,
are necessary for the catalytic activity of esterase EstAS,
similarly to metagenomic lipase LipG [35] and esterase
EstA from marine metagenome [36]. Therefore, manganese ions might carry out three distinct roles in esterase

action: removal of fatty acids as insoluble Mn2+ salts in
certain cases, direct enzyme activation acting as cofactor,
and stabilizing effect on the enzyme.
Effect of detergents and reductors on esterase EstAS
The effects of detergents and reductors on esterase activity
are shown in Table 4. A significant increase in lipolytic
activity was observed with addition of 0.1% Tween 80
(128%), Tween 20 (135%), and 1 mM CTAB (138%), Triton X-100 (119%), after 0.5 h preincubation at 35°C. 1
mM β-mercaptoethanl, DTT did not affect the lipolytic
activity (102% and 101%, respectively). However, DEPC
and SDS had a strong inhibitory effect. In accordance with
the esterase reported by Nawani et al. [36], a total loss of
activity in the presence of SDS but an enhanced activity in
the presence of Triton X-100, and Tween 20 and 80. Interesting, the esterase EstAS activity was not affected by 1 mM
PMSF, suggesting it may possess a lid structure, which
could eliminate the inhibition effect of PMSF, as some
other esterases [10,37,38] and site-directed mutagenesis
of amino acid Ser92 will be carried out to confirm the
function of Ser92.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we identified a new esterase EstAS belonging to family III lipases from SBR activated sludge metagenomic library. EstAS is a very interesting enzyme with
high potential for downstream biotechnological applications. This was confirmed by extensive biochemical characterization, substrate specificity, stability towards
addictives including metal ions and detergents, and also,
wide pH and temperature spectra. This study also demonstrated that the metagenomic approach is very useful for
expanding our knowledge of enzyme diversity, especially
for bacterial esterases. Accessing the metagenomic pool of
lipases and esterases can be an immediate source of novel
biocatalysts, or yield enzymes that can be further specialized by directed evolution.
