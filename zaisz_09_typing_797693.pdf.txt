Abstract
Background: Genotyping of epidemic Clostridium difficile strains is necessary to track their
emergence and spread. Portability of genotyping data is desirable to facilitate inter-laboratory
comparisons and epidemiological studies.
Results: This report presents results from a systematic screen for variation in repetitive DNA in
the genome of C. difficile. We describe two tandem repeat loci, designated 'TR6' and 'TR10', which
display extensive sequence variation that may be useful for sequence-based strain typing. Based on
an investigation of 154 C. difficile isolates comprising 75 ribotypes, tandem repeat sequencing
demonstrated excellent concordance with widely used PCR ribotyping and equal discriminatory
power. Moreover, tandem repeat sequences enabled the reconstruction of the isolates' largely
clonal population structure and evolutionary history.
Conclusion: We conclude that sequence analysis of the two repetitive loci introduced here may
be highly useful for routine typing of C. difficile. Tandem repeat sequence typing resolves
phylogenetic diversity to a level equivalent to PCR ribotypes. DNA sequences may be stored in
databases accessible over the internet, obviating the need for the exchange of reference strains.

Background
Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming,
obligately anaerobic bacterium. It is the leading cause of
nosocomial diarrhoea among patients undergoing antibiotic treatment [1,2]. The severity of C. difficile-associated
disease (CDAD) ranges from mild diarrhoea to pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, and intestinal
perforation [3-6]. Mortality rates of CDAD reportedly

range from 6 to 30% [5,7,8]. During the last decade, the
incidence of CDAD has increased significantly in North
America [9-12] and Europe [4,8,13,14]. In the USA and
Canada, this increase has been associated with the emergence of a novel, hypervirulent strain designated NAP1/
027 [11,15]. Strains with the same genotype and associated outbreaks have also been reported from several European countries [14,16-18].

For infection control investigations and epidemiological
studies, it is mandatory to track the emergence and spread
of epidemic strains. For this purpose, appropriate genotyping methods are needed. The utility of a typing method
will depend on its inter-laboratory reproducibility and
data portability, its discriminatory power and concordance of identified groupings with epidemiology, the temporal stability of the genetic markers investigated, and the
universal typeability of isolates [19]. Multilocus variable
number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) is the most
discriminatory method presently available for typing C.
difficile [20,21]. Recently reported results suggested that
the level of resolution achieved through MLVA may be
highly useful for detecting epidemiological clusters of
CDAD within and between hospitals [21,22]. The genetic
loci currently exploited for MLVA-typing of C. difficile
accumulate variation so rapidly, however, that longerterm relationships between isolates get obscured [23]. It is
therefore advisable – and has been a common practice –
to combine MLVA with the analysis of more conserved
genetic markers [20-23]. Most commonly applied
approaches to genotyping C. difficile at present are DNA
macrorestriction analysis (based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, mostly used in Canada and the USA
[12,15,24]) and PCR ribotyping (in Europe [25-27]).
These two methods yield largely concordant results
[23,27]. While DNA macrorestriction has slightly higher
discriminatory power than PCR ribotyping, it is also more
labour-intensive and time consuming [23,27-29].
A major disadvantage of PCR ribotyping, DNA macrorestriction, and other band-based typing techniques
(including restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) [30])
is the poor portability and interlaboratory comparability
of the generated data. Bacterial strains to be compared
usually need to be run on the same electrophoresis gels,
which requires the exchange of reference strains between
institutions. This requirement seriously hampers epidemiological investigations, particularly at international scales
[21,23].

librium that causes MLST to provide poor discriminatory
power, which is exemplified by the fact that relevant epidemic strains are not resolved [31]. In addition, MLST
remains too expensive to be applied for routine typing
aside from dedicated research projects.
More variable genomic regions may provide improved
discrimination ability. In contrast to MLST, it may even
suffice to sequence a single locus or very few genetic loci
that are sufficiently variable, since – analysing a clonal
population – phylogenetic inferences will rarely be confounded through homologous genetic recombination.
Sequence-based typing schemes relying on one or several
highly discriminatory markers have previously been
established for a number of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus (spa gene) [33], Campylobacter jejuni (flaA)
[34,35], Streptococcus pyogenes (emm) [36] and Neisseria
meningitidis (porA, fetA) [37-39].
The surface layer protein gene slpA has recently been proposed as a promising target for sequence-based typing of
C. difficile [40]. The limited data available suggests
extremely high sequence variation among isolates and,
correspondingly, excellent discriminatory power [23,40].
To date, however, slpA sequencing reportedly has been
applied to a total of only 11 different ribotypes, and it is
not clear if the method is universally applicable [23,40]. It
is anticipated that the requirement for degenerate oligonucleotide primers may restrict the general utility of the
current protocol [39]. The method has as yet not been successfully transferred to any other laboratory [23,40].
This present report describes the development and application of a new assay for genotyping C. difficile that is
based on sequence analysis of two stretches of repetitive
DNA. Investigating a panel of 154 diverse C. difficile isolates, we demonstrate extensive sequence variation in
these genomic regions, resulting in high discriminatory
power, and excellent concordance with PCR ribotyping.

Results and discussion
Typing procedures based on DNA sequences overcome
these limitations, since sequence data may easily be
exchanged and stored in databases that are accessible via
the internet. Accordingly, a scheme for multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) of C. difficile was developed
recently that is based on sequences from seven housekeeping gene fragments [31]. While MLST to date has
been applied to a limited number of isolates, available
data allowed a first glimpse at the largely clonal genetic
population structure of C. difficile [23,31,32]. In clonal
bacteria, novel genotypes in the course of evolution are
generated primarily through mutations, which in slowly
evolving housekeeping genes are rare. Hence, it is this very
clonality of C. difficile and the associated linkage disequi-

Identification of tandem repeat regions suitable for
sequence-based typing
A total of 49 tandem repeat regions that met the selection
criteria (repeat size, 15–40 bp; repeat copy number, > 5;
consensus sequence match, < 90%) were detected in the
genome sequence from strain 630 by using the program
Tandem Repeats Finder version 4.00 [41,42]. For 36 of
these repeat regions, it was possible to design PCR primers
targeting flanking sequences, and from 28, PCR amplification products could reliably be generated from a panel of
reference isolates. However, at 25 of these loci, sequence
variation was insufficient to discriminate widely distributed strains, including ribotypes 027, 017, and 001 (not
shown). The remaining three repeat regions could dis-

criminate most of the ribotypes examined. The two most
variable loci were designated TR6 and TR10 (Table 1).
They are located at positions 0.7 Mb and 3.7 Mb of the C.
difficile 630 chromosome, respectively, and exhibited
both, sequence and length polymorphisms. Locus TR6 is
composed of 21-basepair repeat units and resides within
an open reading frame encoding a hypothetical protein
(orf CD0603 in the 630 genome sequence). A homology
search in public databases did not identify any significant
similarities with known proteins. In contrast, TR10 is
located within a predicted non-coding region. It consists
of 22-basepair repeats.
We developed a DNA based typing scheme for C. difficile
based on the sequence variation of TR6 and TR10. To
facilitate the application of the tandem repeat sequence
typing (TRST) scheme, a duplex PCR was designed which
allowed simultaneous amplification of both loci (Figure
1). Sequence data were generated from duplex PCR products using the same primers as for amplification. Nucleotide sequences from TR6 and TR10 were concatenated
and unique repeat successions were assigned distinct TRST
types (tagged with consecutive numbers, prefixed with
"tr"; Figure 2, Additional files 1, 2). A detailed comparison
of TRST with PCR ribotyping is described in the following.
Clonal evolution of tandem repeat regions
Genomic regions with short tandem repeat regions may
evolve fast due to intra-molecular recombination and frequent polymerase slippage during DNA replication [4345]. Accordingly, loci TR6 and TR10 displayed both,
sequence polymorphisms, generated through exchange of
individual nucleobases (Additional files 3, 4), and length
polymorphisms, as a consequence of repeat copy number
variation (Additional file 2). Sequences of individual
repeats were highly variable, with a nucleotide diversity π
of 0.28 ± 0.01 for TR6 and 0.23 ± 0.01 for TR10. The
majority of nucleotide substitutions at locus TR6 were
synonymous, i. e., they left the encoded amino acid
sequence unaffected, and hence may be considered selectively neutral. This was reflected by a Ka/Ks value of 0.39,
suggesting TR6 sequences evolve under purifying selection. Locus TR10 does not encode any protein and, hence,
sequence variation likely is neutral, too.

Furthermore, there is evidence of rare recombination
between chromosomes from different strains, affecting
tandem repeat sequences. One homologous recombination event apparently generated TRST type tr-021. While
tr-021 shares an identical TR6 sequence with tr-011 (Additional file 2), its TR10 allele differs profoundly from that
of tr-011 in both, length and sequence (Additional files 4
and 2), even though isolates displaying tr-011 (isolate
N551) and tr-021 (SMI037) are affiliated to the same
MLST type (ST-39) and ribotype (011; Figure 3). Interestingly, the TR10 allele of tr-021 is identical to the one of tr005 (Additional file 2). Hence, the drastic difference
between central parts of TR10 in tr-011 and tr-021 may be
explained through a single event of horizontal gene transfer from an unrelated strain. Very similarly, tr-066 and tr045 share identical alleles with closely related TRST types
at either TR6 or TR10, respectively, yet differ drastically
along a contiguous stretch of central repeats at the other
tandem repeat locus. Again, identical alleles may be found
elsewhere in the database (Additional file 2), suggesting
they were horizontally transferred. In our dataset, these
three TRST types displayed the only such discrepancies.
We conclude that genetic recombination between unrelated chromosomes was involved in the evolution of maximally three TRST types out of 72 that were included in
our set of isolates. Hence, the evolution of tandem repeats
TR6 and TR10 is driven largely through clonal diversification, whereas the impact of recombination is extremely
small. These results fully corroborate a previous estimate
of a very low recombination rate in C. difficile, which had
been based on MLST data [31].
While TR6 and TR10 displayed remarkable sequence variation, both loci seemed sufficiently stable to identify
genetically related isolates collected over time. For one,
the stability of TR6 and TR10 was demonstrated by two
VPI 10463 and three 630 strains (including the published
genome sequence), that prior to our analysis each had
been handled in different laboratories (Additional file 1)
and, hence, had independently been subcultured multiple
times, but yet shared the same respective TRST sequence
types (Additional file 1). Furthermore, stability of both
tandem repeat regions was circumstantially suggested
through identical sequences found in multiple isolates

geographical regions (Additional file 1).
Typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with
PCR ribotyping
Results were compared to PCR ribotyping on the basis of
154 isolates including international reference strains and
clinical isolates collected at various German laboratories
(Additional file 1). These isolates had been preselected
from the material available to represent maximal diversity
as judged on the basis of PCR ribotyping and geographic
origin. They represented 75 different ribotypes (Additional file 1). Figure 2 shows a neighbor joining dendrogram based on the repeat successions in concatenated TR6
and TR10 sequences.

All 154 isolates were typeable by TRST. Considering both,
differences in length and nucleotide sequence, 43 distinct
alleles were identified at locus TR6, and 53 alleles at locus
TR10 (Table 2, Additional file 2). Sequencing either one
of the two loci had less discriminatory power than PCR
ribotyping, as reflected by slightly lower discriminatory
indices (0.93 and 0.95, respectively, versus 0.97 for
ribotyping; Table 2). When considered in combination,
however, sequence analysis of TR6 and TR10 resulted in
the identification of 72 different TRST sequence types
among the 154 isolates investigated (Additional file 2,
Figure 2). This way, TRST and PCR ribotyping had equal

discriminatory power, reflected by identical discriminatory indices (Table 2) based on the set of isolates
included. It has to be considered, however, that this estimate will be skewed to some extent in favour of ribotyping, since ribotype diversity was the basis of initial isolate
selection. Many ribotypes were represented by single isolates, and the potential ability of TRST to further discriminate within these ribotypes was thus not tested.
TRST demonstrated high overall concordance with PCR
ribotyping for the set of strains typed in this study, resulting in a calculated Adjusted Rand's index of 89.8% (Table
2). The probability that a pair of isolates with the same
ribotype also shared identical TRST sequence types was
89.6% (Wallace index 0.896). Accordingly, ribotypes usually corresponded to specific TRST sequence types (Figure
2). For example, 18 isolates with ribotype 027, originating
from six different European countries, displayed identical
sequences at TR6 and TR10 that discriminated them from
all other isolates, and jointly were assigned TRST sequence
type tr-027 (Additional file 1, Figure 2). Similarly, four
isolates with ribotype 017 from three different countries,
including the reference strain for toxinotype VIII, were
assigned sequence type tr-017 (Additional file 1, Figure
2). Future work on larger numbers of isolates may reveal
that sequencing a single locus (TR6 or TR10) will suffice
to identify epidemiologically relevant strains. For the sake
of concordance with PCR ribotyping, however, we presently suggest to sequence both loci. As outlined above,
this strategy will also detect the impact of recombination.
Tandem repeat sequences are phylogenetically
informative
Discrepancies between TRST and ribotyping were apparent where either method split a particular group of isolates into two or three classes, whereas the other lumped
them into one (Figure 2). In virtually all of these cases,
however, the respective isolates were affiliated to identical
MLST sequence types or to single locus variants with
respect to MLST (i. e., identical sequences at six out of
seven MLST loci), indicating their close phylogenetic relatedness. Phylogenetic coherence of these additional (sub)classes will remain unclear as long as there are no phylogenetic markers available to investigate the detailed evolutionary history of C. difficile within MLST sequence types.

MLVA typically resolves dozens of distinct genotypes
within individual ribotypes [20,21]. However, MLVA provided little insight to the genetic relatedness within our
collection, since almost all isolates differed from each
other at four or more loci [20], even when they were affiliated to identical TRST sequence types or ribotypes (Figure
3). The sole useful exception was represented by isolates
JW611148 and CL39, which shared identical alleles at five
MLVA loci (Figure 3). The summed tandem-repeat differ-

070, Figure 3). However, these isolates displayed a distinct
one-band difference between their ribotyping patterns,
corresponding to ribotypes 078 and RKI35, respectively
(Figure 4). This result illustrates the fact that ribotypes
may differ widely with respect to the phylogenetic divergence they encompass. It may be noted that two other
pairs of isolates shared highly similar MLVA patterns
(AB403/CL45, NCTC11204/P5732; Figure 3). The
summed tandem-repeat difference for the former pair is
seven repeats, and hence these two isolates would be suggested to be extremely closely related based on MLVA
alone [21]. These similarities, however, clearly reflect
homoplasies, since MLST indicated these isolates were
entirely unrelated (Figure 3). Thus, the application of
MLVA as currently used is inappropriate when attempting
to resolve distant phylogenetic relationships of C. difficile

isolates. Again, in these cases, phylogeny was correctly
indicated by TRST. We therefore conclude that it may be
useful to combine TRST and MLVA in a nested hierarchical fashion, where TRST may resolve phylogenetic diversity to a level equivalent to PCR ribotypes, and MLVA may
add additional resolution where desired.
Evolutionary relationships between isolates may be
revealed through tandem repeat sequence alignment and
phylogenetic analysis. This is also feasible for those isolates that were assigned different TRST types. For example,
ribotypes 027, 156, and 019 by MLST are indicated to be
closely related, since corresponding isolates are assigned
two MLST sequence types that differ at one locus only
(Figure 3). Close relationship of ribotypes 027 and 019
previously has also been found on the basis of DNA macrorestriction analysis, when isolates with both ribotypes
were assigned to the 'North American Pulsotype NAP1'
[23]. Concordantly with MLST and macrorestriction,
TRST also indicated the relatedness of these types through
similar tandem repeat sequences that clustered tightly in
the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), yet it maintained the discriminatory power of PCR ribotyping by assigning three
different sequence types (tr-034, tr-027, tr-019) (Figure
2). Similarly, ribotypes 078 and RKI35 were indicated to
be closely related to ribotype 066 by both, MLST and TRST
(Figures 2 and 3). In contrast, these relationships were not
at all apparent on the basis of ribotyping band patterns
(Figure 4).
Phylogenetic relatedness was also indicated in cases where
TRST was more discriminatory than PCR ribotyping. For
example, ribotypes 001, 163, 087, 014, and 117 each were
subdivided into several TRST types (Figure 2). Clusters of
related tandem repeat sequences in the phylogenetic tree
still corresponded to PCR ribotypes (Figure 2), which warrants the comparability of results from both methods.
This feature may be highly desirable, since it will facilitate,
for example, cross-referencing to ribotyping-based examinations and maintaining the continuity of ongoing surveillance programs.
Ribotyping does not enable phylogenetic analyses based
on dissimilar banding patterns, and the relatedness of dif-

ferent ribotypes has not commonly been assessed. In the
long run, large-scale mutation discovery and genomic (re)sequencing will reveal the phylogenetic validity of typing
procedures [46].
Future prospects
We anticipate that PCR ribotyping will eventually be
replaced by typing procedure(s) based on DNA
sequences. The inherent portability of sequence data will
obviate the need for the exchange of reference strains and
enable decentralised genotyping efforts, which may boost
large scale investigations on the molecular diversity of C.
difficile. At present, however, our knowledge about the
diversity and population biology of this important pathogen is very limited [23,31,32]. As a consequence, it is generally not clear if isolate groupings provided by various
typing methods, including PCR ribotyping, are concordant with the epidemiology of associated disease [21,23].
Related to these considerations, one limitation of this
present study is the lack of epidemiologically linked isolates in our data set. Investigations in the near future
should evaluate the utility of tandem repeat sequencing
for infection chain tracking and short-term epidemiological investigations.

Conclusion
Sequence analysis of tandem repeats TR6 and TR10 provided full typeability across a wide range of C. difficile isolate diversity, excellent concordance with PCR ribotyping,
and equal discriminatory ability. Sequence clades corresponded to phylogenetically coherent groupings. This
sequencing-based typing approach may prove particularly
useful because DNA sequences can easily be exchanged
via the internet.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
A total of 154 C. difficile isolates comprising 75 different
ribotypes were used in this study. The strain collection
included both, international reference strains and selected
clinical isolates from various German hospitals, collected
in 2007 and 2008. More detailed information about individual isolates is given in Additional file 1.
DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was isolated from cultures grown for 48 h
on cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar (OXOID, Basingstoke, UK), by using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.
PCR ribotyping
PCR ribotyping initially was performed at the Reference
Laboratory for Clostridium difficile at the Leiden University
Medical Center in the Netherlands and later was trans-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/6

ferred to the Robert Koch Institute. We followed the protocol of Bidet et al. [26], except that PCR Products were
run on 1.5% agarose gels in 1× TBE at 85 volts for 4 hours.
Isolates were assigned novel PCR ribotypes if their patterns differed from previously named patterns by at least
one band.
Tandem repeat sequence typing (TRST)
To facilitate the application of tandem repeat sequence
typing, a duplex PCR was designed using the following
primers: TR6-F (5'-TTTCAACTTGTCCAGTTTTTAAGTC-3')
and TR6-R (5'-ATGACATAGCGTTTGTGGAAT-3'); TR10-F
(5'-TGCATCAAATTGGTCAAGACTC-3') and TR10-R (5'TGAAATCATTGACTATAAAGCAAAA-3'). DNA amplification was performed on 1 μl of purified genomic DNA in a
final volume of 50 μl containing 0.1 μM of TR6 and 1 μM
of TR10 primers, 200 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1× PeqLab PCR buffer Y (20 mM Tris-HCL, 16
mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20, 2 mM MgCl2) and 1.25
units Hot Taq-DNA-Polymerase (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). After an initial denaturation of 96°C for 3 min,
the protocol consisted of 35 cycles at 96°C for 45 s, 52°C
for 45 s, and 72°C for 45 s following a final extension at
72°C for 7 min. PCR products were prepared for sequencing using the QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN,
Hilden, Germany) and 0.35 μl of the purified products
were applied for sequencing using the BigDye Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, USA) with identical primers employed in the PCR.
Automated sequence detection was performed on an ABI
capillary sequencing system and sequences were analysed
using the BioNumerics 5.10 software (Applied Maths, Belgium).
Classification of TRST types, repeat alignment, and cluster
analysis
Data processing was performed with BioNumerics 5.10 by
using a novel, dedicated "Repeat Typing" plugin that
allowed automated batch assembly of trace files. The
assignment of TRST sequence types was based on the successive occurrence of user-defined repeats in concatenated
sequences from both tandem repeat loci. A repeat distance
matrix for matching and clustering were calculated based
on the DSI model [47], a mutation model comprising
substitutions, indels (insertions or deletions), and duplications. Subsequent cluster analysis was performed based
on the neighbor joining algorithm.
Multilocus sequence typing
Clostridium difficile isolates were typed by MLST as
described previously [31]. Sequence data were submitted
to the C. difficile MLST database http://www.pasteur.fr/
recherche/genopole/PF8/mlst/Cdifficile.html to assign
allele profiles and the resulting sequence types. Sequence
types were analysed by constructing a dendrogram based

on the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with
Arithmetic mean) clustering algorithm using the multistate categorical similarity coefficient (tolerance 0%)
available in the BioNumerics software.

MLVA
Seven-locus MLVA was conducted as described previously
[20,22], except that the different loci were PCR-amplified
individually and PCR products were sequenced for repeat
copy number determination. To facilitate sequence analysis of MLVA locus C6 [20], two novel oligonucleotide
primers were used: C6-F 5'-CCAAGTCCCAGGATTATTGC3' and C6-R 5'-AACATGGGGATTGGAATTGA-3'. Repeat
copy numbers were determined manually using BioNumerics 5.10 software. The summed tandem-repeat difference was calculated where appropriate; it is the sum of
repeat differences between two isolates at all seven MLVA
loci [21].
Discriminatory power, system concordance and molecular
evolutionary analyses
An index of discrimination was calculated to compare the
discriminating capacity of ribotyping, and TRST. The discriminatory index was defined as the average probability
of two consecutively sampled strains being characterized
as the same type. This probability depends on the number
of strain types and their frequency distribution in the population. Discriminatory indices were calculated based on
Simpson's index of diversity [48]. Confidence intervals for
discriminatory indices were determined as described previously [49]. The Concordance of two typing schemes was
calculated based on the adjusted Rand's and Wallace's
coefficients [50]. While the Rand's coefficient allows a
quantitative evaluation of the global congruence between
two typing systems, the Wallace's coefficient compares the
congruence of schemes depending on the directionality of
typing by estimating the probability that a pair of isolates
sharing the same type in system 1 also share the same type
in system 2, and vice versa. Calculation of all parameters
was performed with EpiCompare software, version 1.0
(Ridom GmbH, Würzburg, Germany).

The nucleotide diversity (π) and the ratio (Ka/Ks) of the
average number of non-synonymous substitutions per
non-synonymous site (Ka) to the number to synonymous
substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) was calculated by
using DnaSP, version 4.5 [51].
