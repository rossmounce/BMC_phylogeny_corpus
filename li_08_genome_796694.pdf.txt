Abstract
Background: Genomes of lower organisms have been observed with a large amount of horizontal
gene transfers, which cause difficulties in their evolutionary study. Bacteriophage genomes are a
typical example. One recent approach that addresses this problem is the unsupervised clustering
of genomes based on gene order and genome position, which helps to reveal species relationships
that may not be apparent from traditional phylogenetic methods.
Results: We propose the use of an overlapping subspace clustering algorithm for such genome
classification problems. The advantage of subspace clustering over traditional clustering is that it
can associate clusters with gene arrangement patterns, preserving genomic information in the
clusters produced. Additionally, overlapping capability is desirable for the discovery of multiple
conserved patterns within a single genome, such as those acquired from different species via
horizontal gene transfers. The proposed method involves a novel strategy to vectorize genomes
based on their gene distribution. A number of existing subspace clustering and biclustering
algorithms were evaluated to identify the best framework upon which to develop our algorithm;
we extended a generic subspace clustering algorithm called HARP to incorporate overlapping
capability. The proposed algorithm was assessed and applied on bacteriophage genomes. The phage
grouping results are consistent overall with the Phage Proteomic Tree and showed common
genomic characteristics among the TP901-like, Sfi21-like and sk1-like phage groups. Among 441
phage genomes, we identified four significantly conserved distribution patterns structured by the
terminase, portal, integrase, holin and lysin genes. We also observed a subgroup of Sfi21-like phages
comprising a distinctive divergent genome organization and identified nine new phage members to
the Sfi21-like genus: Staphylococcus 71, phiPVL108, Listeria A118, 2389, Lactobacillus phi AT3, A2,
Clostridium phi3626, Geobacillus GBSV1, and Listeria monocytogenes PSA.
Conclusion: The method described in this paper can assist evolutionary study through objectively
classifying genomes based on their resemblance in gene order, gene content and gene positions.
The method is suitable for application to genomes with high genetic exchange and various
conserved gene arrangement, as demonstrated through our application on phages.

Background
One of the key problems in computational biology is the
detection of evolutionary relationships using genomic
information. For higher organisms, such relationships are
often computed as a phylogenetic tree according to criteria such as the divergence of primary sequences, gene content, and gene order [1]. For microorganisms including
viruses and bacteriophages, however, a phylogenetic tree
may not completely describe their relationship because of
the relatively large amount of horizontal gene transfers
(HGT) in their evolutionary history [2-4]. Consequently,
alternative strategies such as genome classification based
on gene distribution [5] and classification based on short
nucleotide sequences [6] have recently been proposed to
provide different perspectives for understanding their
genomic relationships. These strategies may not independently provide a complete description of evolutionary
history, but they undoubtedly offer evolutionary insights
that may not be obtained from tree-based phylogeny.
Gene-distribution-based classification or clustering refers
to the task of identifying and grouping genomes with similar gene content, gene order, and positional coupling
within local or global genomic segments (the concept of
"local" and "global" here is analogous to that in sequence
alignment). Although a number of computational methods related to gene distribution and genome rearrangement are currently available, these methods focus mainly
on the close inspection of a few related species and tree
reconstructions, and are not capable of discovering clusters among a large collection of genomes. Details of these
methods are provided in the Discussion section. The pioneering method that is capable of clustering and providing evolutionary insights for a large number of genomes
including distant species was proposed only recently [5].
The method, SynFPS, derives a score for each pair of
genomes from gene-gene distances and then applies K-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/116

means over the pairwise scores to produce genome clustering [5]. The method has two major limitations. Firstly,
although genome clusters are derived from gene distribution, the algorithm cannot dictate the consensus gene distribution pattern of each cluster. Knowing what species
are related but not knowing the exact basis on which they
are related can hinder further investigation of species relationships. Secondly, each genome is clustered into exactly
one group, preventing a species from belonging to multiple clusters (overlapping clustering). This prohibits analysis of the genomes within which multiple conserved gene
arrangement patterns have been acquired through HGT.
The clustering problem itself and these two limitations are
illustrated in Figure 1.
Motivated by the need for overlapping clustering and consensus gene pattern identification, we propose in this
paper an overlapping subspace clustering technique for
genome classification. Subspace clustering, also known as
projected clustering and biclustering, is aimed at identifying objects that are similar in subspaces of the input space
(the object space) [7,8]. If a dataset contains M data and
N dimensions, traditional clustering would identify one
or more clusters within the dataset, with each cluster containing m ? M data that are similar in the ?N space. In contrast, subspace clustering would further associate each
cluster with a subset of dimensions, such that each cluster
would contain data that are only similar in its associated
subspace S ? ?N. Subspace clustering can be further classified as disjoint or overlapping. In disjoint clustering, each
object can only be assigned to one or no (outlier) clusters,
whereas in overlapping clustering, each object can be
assigned to any number of clusters.
Our research began with the creation of an evaluation
data set that models the difficult issues often encountered
in genome clustering problems (reported in Methods). A

number of recent and popular subspace clustering algorithms were then evaluated for their performance on the
evaluation data set. As not all these algorithms are capable
of producing overlapping clustering, a number of different evaluation measures were employed. We then modified the best performing algorithm, HARP, to achieve
enhanced accuracy as well as overlapping capability. The
modified algorithm that we propose is called O-HARP [9].
Clustering results generated by O-HARP can assist evolutionary study by objectively classifying the genomes based
on their resemblance in gene order, gene content and
genome positions. The algorithm is suitable for application to genomes with high genetic exchange and various
conserved gene arrangements. Bacteriophage (phage)
genomes are an example and are the application focus of
this work. Phages are particularly suitable for gene-distribution-based clustering analysis because they have undergone extensive HGT while their genomes still preserve
certain conservations of gene order and gene position
[10]; extensive HGT events have caused an inadequacy of
the present phage taxonomic classification system [11]
and thereby clustering based on conserved gene arrangement can provide augmented evolutionary insights.

Results
Method overview
The application of subspace clustering to genome classification requires data preprocessing and output interpretation. The components involved in this process are
illustrated in Figure 2.

Gene mapping refers to the determination of gene-gene
correspondence across the genome sequences. The objective of this step is to define a group of genes which distribution will be used as the basis for genome classification.
For our experiments where phages are the focus, we detect
gene correspondence in two steps. Firstly, BLASTP with
Blosum62 was used to group together genes with significant sequence similarity (E-value < 0.1) [12]. In the second step, genome annotation mining based on regular
expression [5] was employed to bring analogous gene
groups together, targeting the problem of divergent phage
genes [5]. Each resulting group consists of a set of analo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/116

gous genes, hereafter all treated equally; protein distance
information is discarded after gene grouping.
Genome vectorization refers to the representation of gene
distribution information as numeric vectors. We propose
that each genome be represented by two pieces of information: the relative genome positions between all possible pairs of genes and the absolute positions of the genes.
For example, let there be a genome G1 with gene A located
at position 10 bp (10 basepairs from the start of the
genome), gene B at 60 bp, and gene C at 30 bp. Let there
be another genome G2 with gene A at 15 bp, gene B at 50
bp and gene C absent. The numeric vectors of these two
genomes are shown in Table 1. The values for relative
positions are signed (e.g. negative value for dimension "BC" in G1), thus capturing gene order information as well
as gene-gene distances. A gene may be present in one
genome while being absent in another. In this case, the
values associated with the missing gene in a genome will
not be available, and can be implemented as NaN (not a
number) in many modern computing languages such as
Java. These missing values can be naturally handled by
axis-aligned subspace clustering algorithms, as one of
their fundamental abilities is to filter out subsets of
dimensions. With this vectorization technique, the use of
n genes will lead to a total of nC2+n dimensions.
A subspace clustering algorithm (e.g. O-HARP) processes the
vectorized gene distribution data and produces a set of
clusters as the output. Each cluster contains a set of
genomes and is associated with a subspace that dictates
the common gene distribution pattern of that cluster.
Extraction of meaningful subspaces is a procedure to remove
clusters that have subspaces corresponding to a non-continuous gene distribution. A continuous distribution is
defined to represent a conserved pattern among all the
genes of interest; unless conserved property is observed in
each pair of genes, the distribution is regarded as non-continuous. Enforcing continuous gene distribution can
reduce the size and enhance interpretability of the
resulted clusters.

The proposed overlapping subspace clustering algorithm:
extension to HARP
We evaluated a number of recent and popular subspace
clustering algorithms (see next subsection) and identified
HARP [13] as the best existing algorithm in terms of subspace clustering accuracy (SCE), clusters coverage (CI) and
correct number of clusters (DNC) (refer to Methods: Performance measures). HARP is a relatively recent algorithm
designed for general subspace clustering and has been
reported with performance superior to PROCLUS [14],
ORCLUS [15] and FastDOC [16]. HARP uses an agglomerative hierarchical approach, in which the algorithm
begins by considering each individual data as a separate
cluster and subsequently builds up larger clusters by merging the smaller ones. With such an approach, at least one
pair of clusters should be merged in every iteration of the
algorithm, and therefore a criterion is needed to decide
which pair is to be merged next. To achieve this, HARP
uses a merge score to rate how well two clusters can be
merged. If there is a total of n clusters, then there are nC2
(n choose 2) merge scores that need to be computed. To
reduce computational complexity, the authors proposed
the use of individual statistics (e.g. means and variances)
of the n separate clusters to compute the merge scores
instead of using statistics of the nC2 potential clusters.
Nevertheless, such merge score have been developed for
disjoint clustering only and bias exists in the merge of
unequal-sized clusters.

all the jth dimensional values across the dataset. With our
genome vectorization strategy, the dataset contains two
types of values: relative positions and absolute positions
(refer to genome vectorization), which suggests that there
are two groups of associated values across all the dimensions. The merge score (MS) between two clusters C i1 and

B) Algorithmic procedure for overlapping clustering
A simple agglomerative hierarchical approach to overlapping subspace clustering is to always retain the merging
clusters. With such an approach, however, the number of
clusters would grow exponentially with the number of
data – complexity O(2M) where M is the number of data.
Additionally, clusters overlapping with each other may be

dependent on each other, in which case merging between
them is not necessary and the computation of their merge
scores adds unnecessary computational burden. Moreover, if
a cluster has a subspace S, then the same set of data can
always form a cluster in a space S' ? S, which leads to clustering ambiguity. Finally, a subspace cluster can be
obtained by merging its constituting clusters in many different ways. If the merging mechanism is not controlled,
then the algorithm can generate a lot of redundant clusters.
Any hierarchical overlapping clustering algorithms should
address the above issues. O-HARP's main contribution
lies in its overlapping capability. The following notions
are defined: If two clusters are combined to form a new
cluster and are discarded afterwards, they are said to have
merged. If they form a new cluster and are retained afterwards, they are said to have generated a new child cluster
and are referred to as the parents of the new child cluster.
Two clusters are merged if there is no dimensional reduction in the resulting cluster; otherwise a new cluster is generated (see Figure 3). These definitions imply the
following two conditions: i) the set of data in a child cluster is a superset of the data in its parent clusters and ii) the
set of dimensions in a child cluster is a subset of the data
in its parent clusters. The algorithmic procedure is listed in
Table 2 (a more detailed pseudo code can be found in
Additional File 1). Line L1 is referred to as the d loosening
mechanism, a concept borrowed from HARP [13]. The
purpose is to start matching clusters with large subspaces
first, and allow smaller subspaces and forbid larger subspaces in later iterations. This mechanism effectively maximizes the subspace between two merging clusters and
prevents them from forming multiple ambiguous clusters
in different subspaces. Moreover, this outermost loop
indicates that computational complexity is linearly proportional to the number of dimensions, suggesting that
the algorithm is favorable for high dimensional data.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/116

BuildScoreCache at line L2 refers to computing and storing in memory all MS scores larger than threshold t and
that have a subspace with d dimensions. As mentioned
previously, simply pairing up all clusters and computing
their MS scores is not practical. Whether a potential match
(i.e. merge or new cluster generation) is allowed is controlled within BuildScoreCache by the following rules:
R1. Each pair of clusters can only have 1 child (yet each
cluster can still have multiple children).
R2. Clusters in a family line cannot merge or generate new
cluster with each other.
R3. All the clusters in a subspace must be disjoint (they
can only overlap in different subspaces).
Rule R1 is used to prevent the same subset of data from
forming separate clusters in different subspaces and hence
to avoid the formation of ambiguous clusters. Moreover,
having multiple child clusters from the same set of parents
can potentially lead to redundant clusters. As child clusters inherit data and subspace from their parents, matching between clusters within the same family line is
prohibited by R2 for the same reasons: to avoid ambiguous and redundant clusters. Rule R3 simply states that no
fuzzy clustering [17] is allowed. This is because fuzzy clustering adds computational complexity and is unnecessary
for the genome clustering problem.
After the function BuildScoreCache is performed, the
memory (cache) holds information for all matching pairs
that satisfy t, d and R1-R3. The best candidate pair is
selected and removed from the cache repeatedly until all
possible matches are performed (see L3 in Table 2). The
best candidate pair is defined as the youngest descendant
clusters of the pair with the highest MS score that shares

the same subspace (implemented in L4). This is such that
cluster coverage is maximized with the given threshold t;
matching the highest MS-score pair forgoes future opportunities of matching with its child clusters, leading to suboptimal cluster coverage. After each match, the ancestordescendant (parent-child) relationships among the clusters are updated, and all MS entries that are associated
with the new update must be revised and checked for rule
compliant again (L5-L7). After the core loop, L10 in Table
2 is used to filter out clusters that are insignificant with
respect to i) the number of data and dimensions in the
clusters and ii) similarity against their parent or child clusters, as detailed below.
i) Given a filtering threshold 0 ? f ? 1, a cluster is considered to have a significant number of data and dimensions
if and only if the condition (5) defined below holds true
?m + (1-?)n ? f

(5)

? = N/(M + N)

(6)

where m and n are the number of data and the number of
dimensions in the cluster respectively, and M and N the
total number of data and dimensions in the dataset. The
role of ? is to handle any bias caused by the discrepancy
between M and N. At f = 0, all clusters are considered significant.
ii) Given two clusters C and C' with an ancestor-descendant relationship, their similarity index (SI) is defined as:
SI(C, C') = ?m + (1 - ?)n

(7)

m = |dC - dC|/max(dC, dC')

(8)

n = |iC - iC'|/max(iC, iC')

(9)

where d is the number of data and i the number of dimensions of the subscripted cluster, ? has the same definition
as in equation (6). Using the same threshold f as before,

the two clusters are regarded as significantly different if
and only if SI ? f. Based on this rule, we are able to extract
only a subset of clusters that are significantly different
from each other in terms of their data and dimensions.
Time complexity of O-HARP is O(2M × c(HARP)), where
c(HARP) = M2(N2 + log2M) is the complexity of the nonoverlapping version of HARP developed by Yip et al.
(2004) [13]. The multiplication factor 2M is the number
of clusters that O-HARP converges to given t = 0 (worst
case). This increased complexity is however not a practical
concern for the genome clustering problem, as M would
be limited by the number of genomes deposited in the
database. In the application on 441 phage genomes (see
later section), where M = 441 and N = 8,001 (made up
from 126 gene groups), the running time on a Pentium IV,
2.8 GHz single CPU machine is ~20 minutes.
Algorithm Evaluation
A) Existing algorithms considered
In order to evaluate O-HARP, we compared its performance on the genome clustering evaluation data set against
a selection of other algorithms. The selection is based on
a number of properties: i) reported performance, ii) popularity determined by the number of citations, iii)
recency, iv) availability of implementation, as well as v)
problem relevance. All the selected algorithms are clustering-based algorithms for comparability; a tree-based
method is compared and reported separately in the next
section.

Table 3 shows the selected algorithms and the parameters
with which they have been tested on our evaluation dataset. HARP represents a group of subspace clustering algorithms including PROCLUS, ORCLUS and FastDOC, as it
embodies the essential characteristics of these algorithms
such as disjoint and Euclidean-distance-based clustering.
HARP was included for algorithmic evaluation because it
has the best performance among this group of algorithms
and is the developmental basis of our proposed algorithm. Cheng-Church [18] and SAMBA [19] are two pop-

suggests that Cheng-Church may produce reasonable
results on our genome clustering problem. In contrast,
SAMBA works on a more limiting principle, where subspace clusters are formed based solely on the signs of data.
Nevertheless, we believe it is of general bioinformatics
interest to assess the performance of these popular biclustering algorithms on the genome clustering problem. SynFPS [5] is not a subspace clustering method but was
designed to cluster genomes based on gene distribution,
and is therefore included for comparison. The n-gram
clustering method [6] was developed to classify species
based on frequencies of short nucleotide sequences. This

uation because its target application, genome clustering, is
highly similar to ours. HARP, SynFPS and n-gram produce
only disjoint clusters. Therefore, their evaluation will be
based on the seven disjoint clusters of our evaluation
dataset only.
B) Results
The performances of O-HARP and other algorithms are
shown in Table 4. O-HARP has the best SCE, CI and DNC
scores, which indicate that it has the best ability to detect
consensus gene distribution patterns (implied by its
detected subspaces) and genome clusters without including excessive unnecessary clusters. O-HARP's RCE score is
however lower than those of SynFPS and HARP. This
means that without considering the subspace correctness,
the data are grouped better in SynFPS and HARP. By looking at individual RCE scores for each cluster, we find that
the average RCE across the disjoint clusters for O-HARP,
HARP and SynFPS are 0.25, 0.35 and 0.10 respectively,
indicating that O-HARP actually has a better RCE than

HARP when only the disjoint clusters are considered.
Consequently, we may only conclude that applying SynFPS and HARP on a disjoint problem produces better
results than applying O-HARP on an overlapping problem. The major drawback of SynFPS and HARP is their
inability to produce overlapping clusters. On the other
hand, n-gram produces a poor RCE score even when only
the seven disjoint clusters are considered. Such incompatibility between n-gram's clustering and the model clustering (i.e. evaluation data) suggests that frequent short
nucleotide sequences encode no information about gene
distribution.
HARP, SAMBA and Cheng-Church produce low SCE
scores for different reasons. HARP produced higher RCE
scores than SCE scores for 6 out of the 7 disjoint clusters
when the clusters are individually analyzed, indicating
that its performance bottleneck is in subspace identification rather than data grouping. This weakness is mainly
caused by its definition of the dimensional global variance, the improved version of which is employed by OHARP. SAMBA uses a probabilistic model to detect up/
down regulation in gene expression data [19]. As
expected, the model does not generalize to our problem
and failed to detect 10 out of 13 clusters from our evaluation dataset, which is the main reason for a low SCE.
Cheng-Church uses a similarity score called the mean
squared residue to detect coherent rows and/or columns
in a dataset [18]. This model is able to capture Euclideanbased similarity, as required by our problem. Consequently, the performance is better than SAMBA. However,
it tends to include excessive dimensions and data in the
clusters, causing a relatively low SCE score. It is noteworthy to restate that we included Cheng-Church and SAMBA
for performance comparison because of their popularity
for biclustering in bioinformatics research.
O-HARP detected four out of 13 clusters poorly. However,
as we lowered the filtering threshold f, we found that these
clusters could in fact be correctly identified: at f < 0.15, the
CI scores produced by O-HARP are close to perfect
(~0.07) while SCE ?0.6. This suggests that O-HARP can
identify all the clusters in the evaluation data set, but there
is not a single threshold value that can produce the ideal
filtering across all clusters. Nevertheless, it is arguable
whether such a single threshold is necessary or feasible
because the model clustering of an unsupervised learning
problem, upon which algorithms are evaluated, is inevitably subjective.
Similarities and new perspectives against the Phage
Proteomic Tree
We further compared O-HARP to the Phage Proteomic
Tree (PPT) [12] to validate its biological significance. The
PPT utilizes sequence distances among the predicted pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/116

teome of phages to function as a genome-based taxonomical system. With PPT, Rohwer and Edwards showed the
relationship of 105 phages with an unrooted tree and classified the genomes into related phage groups based on
their proteomic distances [12]. Phage groups of Siphoviridae (sk1-like, ?-ike, TP901-like, sfi21-like and D29-like)
consist of a total of 45 phages, representing a significant
portion of the total number of phages analyzed [12]. The
Siphophage groups deduced from PPT, along with the
clustering results generated by O-HARP over the same 105
phages, are illustrated in Figure 4. The strength of association between a phage and a phage group is shown by different levels of grey, and is determined by the proteomic
distance in the case of the PPT and by the difference in
gene distribution in the case of O-HARP.
Figure 4 shows an overall agreement between the two
approaches to phage classification. The more remarkable
differences come from Bacillus subtilis phage 105 and
Streptococcus thermophilus phage 7201, which are classified
as TP901-like and Sfi21-like respectively by PPT, but are
equally clustered across three phage groups by O-HARP.
O-HARP weakly associated phage 105 as TP901-like
because of the absence of the integrase gene, which is
highly positionally conserved among the other members
of the group. Consequently, although there is strong
resemblance in other genes in terms of genomic distribution, phage 105 was found in a child cluster to the core
TP901-like cluster, instead of the TP901-like cluster itself.
The same explanation also applies to the weak classification of phage 7201 as Sfi21-like. Phage 105 is also classified as Sfi21-like and sk1-like because it showed relatively
strong resemblance in the distribution of a set of genes
including the terminase, portal, tape measure, holin and
lysin. Likewise, phage 7201 is classified as sk1-like and
TP901-like because of a distribution resemblance over the
similar gene set. These observations suggest that the
genomic structures of Sfi21-like, TP901-like and sk1-like
phages do share a certain degree of similarity over a nontrivial set of genes. The genomic position of the structural
genes of Sfi21 and TP901-1 are illustrated in Figure 5;
phage sk1 also has similar gene arrangements. The comparison shows that the genomes are highly similar when
they are circularized (more discussion on circular
genomes is provided in the next section). In fact, Sfi21like, TP901-like and sk1-like phages coexist in the same
descendant subspace cluster when the requirement of
absolute genomic position similarity is relaxed. This suggests that, unlike the ?- and D29-like phage groups, the
Sfi21-, TP901- and sk1-like phage groups might be validly
considered as subgroups of a more generic group.
O-HARP predicted phage groups that are compatible to
the PPT (and hence the ICTV classification system [11]).
Additionally, it enabled the genomes to be analyzed from

Figure 4
Comparison of phage clusters between PPT ("P") and O-HARP ("O")
Comparison of phage clusters between PPT ("P") and O-HARP ("O"). A darker color indicates a stronger association between the phage and the phage group. Association strength is determined by proteomic distance for PPT and gene-distribution distance for O-HARP. For instance, phage bIL170 has a darker grey than bIL67 in the sk1-like group for the alphabet
letter "P" because it has a closer proteomic distance to phage sk1. Phage 933W has a light grey for "O" because its gene distribution (computed by O-HARP) is not as close to phage ? as some other phages such as HK97 and P22. Abbreviation: ? – Bacteriophage.

the perspective of gene distribution, augmenting existing
knowledge of phage relationships. Another advantage of
O-HARP over the PPT is that it can cluster uncompleted
(partial) genomes by matching local genomic arrangements, in contrast to the method of proteomic distance
which requires genomes to have comparable sizes for an
unbiased measurement.

G3 are rather more diverse than the two similar gene order
patterns G4 and G5, in which both have more specific
hosts, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Between these two
groups, the location of the holin/lysin genes becomes a
striking feature, in which the holin/lysin genes are positioned outside of the ter-ptl-int group in G4, whereas in G5
they are placed between the int gene and the ter-ptl group.

Four common gene arrangements detected in 441 phage
genomes
We applied O-HARP to 441 phage genomes, comprising
all the complete phage genomes and 23 prophage
genomes available from NCBI as at December 2007 [20].
Six clusters that are associated with the rearrangement of
integrase, terminase, holin, lysin and portal protein are
illustrated in Figure 6. These five genes are selected
because they are found to be strongly conserved in position, as determined by the number of members in their
associated subspace clusters generated by O-HARP. The
other genes that are found conserved in the neighboring
ancestor and descendant clusters, including structural
genes major head, major tail and tape measure, are also
illustrated in Figure 6.

G6 consists of only P2-like bacteriophages (Myoviridae),
having a terminase gene at one end of the genome and
integrase in the middle. A comparison between G6 and G2
reveals that the gene arrangement of int-ptl-ter-hol appears
to be highly similar if the genomes are circularized. In fact,
pattern G2 contains Haemophilus HP1 and HP2, which
have been shown to possess similar genes to bacteriophage P2 and have been literally and taxonomically
grouped into the P2-like genus [22]. It is however noteworthy that these P2-like phages all contain unique genes,
some with unknown functions. P2-like phages, including
members of G2 and G6, normally appear in a linear form
of double-stranded DNA in their life cycles, but appear in
a circular form during DNA replication in the lytic cycle
[23]. Patterns G2 and G6 being similar in gene arrangement and appearing in circular form during replication
indicate that their differentiation is caused by different
cleavages to the circular DNA during replication. The difference in cleavage sites may in turn be a result of natural
selection or spontaneous mutation. An analogous consideration can be applied to the comparison between G1 and
G5, which is similar to the contrast between TP901-like
and Sfi21-like phages discussed previously. However,
regardless of the difference in cleavage sites, G2 and G6
(G1 and G5) actually formed a single cluster at a descendant node where the dimensions associated with absolute
positioning of genes are excluded. This feature of O-HARP
helps avoid biases that arise from arbitrary start points of
circular genomes (14% of the phages shown in Figure 6
have circular genomes – see phage details in Additional
File 1).

The four more notable gene distribution patterns are G1,
G3, G4 and G5, comprising a total of 100 bacteriophages.
This indicates that the gene order for integrase (int), terminase (ter) and portal (ptl) is highly conserved in two distinct arrangements among the observed phage
population: int-ter-ptl for G1 and ter-ptl-int for G3, G4 and
G5. Holin and lysin are arranged in various positions,
which may be associated with different functional strategies for leaving hosts in terms of timing control [21].
Gene order pattern G3, which lacks holin and lysin genes,
consists of phages that infect distantly related hosts,
including phyla Actinobacteria (Mycobacterium), Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas) and Firmicutes (Staphylococcus).
Because of the absence of holin and lysin, members in the

phage members for that pattern. Prophages are underlined. The strongly positionally conserved genes are depicted with circles. The inclined gene symbols (e.g. prt) depict genes that are conserved in terms of position and existence among most, but
not all, of the phage members.

The current phage taxonomical system has been discussed
recently and new genera for Siphoviridae have been proposed [24,25]. One of the proposed genera was 'Sfi21like' and eight completely sequenced phages were originally proposed by Brüssow and Desiere as members of
that genus [24]. Six out of these eight phages agree with
our observation in pattern G5 (see Table 5). The two others (phage adh and 7201), although having close proteomic distance to Sfi21-like phages, have their terminaseportal gene cluster located in the middle while holin and

lysin genes are located towards the end of the genome,
contradicting with G5. These two phages, in contrast to
the other members, would have evolved with a holinlysin gene translocation event. This indicates that there is
a subgroup of Sfi21-like phages comprising a relatively
divergent genome organization, and that 'Sfi21-like'
should be a multi-group population rather than a group
(genus).

Comparison among the results proposed by Brüssow and Desiere [24], Phage Proteomic Tree [12], and O-HARP. A solid circle corresponds to
strong evidence for a phage being a member of Sfi21-like; an outlined circle corresponds to weaker evidence. Abbreviation: ? – Bacteriophage.

Our observation also suggests that there are nine new
members of the group 'Sfi21-like' according to their
organizational similarity in the selected genes. These nine
members are Staphylococcus 71, phiPVL108, Listeria A118,
2389, Lactobacillus phi AT3, A2, Clostridium phi3626, Geobacillus GBSV1, and Listeria monocytogenes PSA (see Table
5). Besides sharing a similar landmark-like gene organization, these phages also infect closely related hosts in terms
of phylogenetic relations. These phages, however, were
not detected by the PPT as Sfi21-like. Our results herein
imply that gene distribution information might provide a
new perspective on the phage classification system.

Discussion
Relevance and incompatibility of other computational
methods
Inspecting species relationships based on gene distribution utilizes information about gene co-occurrence, gene
order, gene-to-gene distances and absolute gene positions
in the genome. Many works have contributed to evolutionary knowledge by manually inspecting species from

the same lineage based on gene distribution [24,26-29].
Nevertheless, the use of computational methods is necessary to tackle the rapidly increasing amount of genome
data. Although a number of computational methods
related to gene distribution and genome rearrangement
exist, most of them are not capable of clustering whole
genomes based on genomic-context information, hence
the development of this work. More specifically, existing
methods such as ADHoRe [30], EM_TRAILS [31] and EDE
[32] have been designed for analyzing closely related species and are only capable of handling genes that are common in all the genomes being compared; genes not shared
by any one of the genomes must be removed prior to analysis [33]. Many other computational comparative genomics methods related to gene rearrangement are also limited
by the requirement that the species being compared must
be closely related [5,34]. While these methods are evidently valuable for the analysis of mammalian genomes,
they are not capable of a large-scale, high-level analysis of
microbial genomes where wide samples across distant
species are analyzed collectively. Large-scale, high-level

analyses are however indispensable for revealing evidence
concerning evolution and diversity within a population
[35]. Other methods related to gene distribution are
Grappa [36], MGR [33] and the genomic-structure conservation approach [37]. These methods, as well as EDE, are
aimed at phylogenetic tree reconstruction, which completeness in describing evolutionary relationships among
microbial species is still debated [2-4]. Methods such as
Larmarck [38], the P-quasi complete linkage approach
[39] and ADHoRe provide clustering techniques to predict
operons and collinear genomic blocks among multiple
species, but they provide no clear linkage to phylogenetic
inference and cannot classify or cluster genomes. In
human genomics research, there is one group of methods
that aim to align conserved regions and produce mapping
among multiple genomes. Examples are SLAGAN [40],
Mauve [41] and MAGIC [34]. These methods are related
to the genome clustering problem discussed in this paper,
in the sense that they also identify genomic segments that
exhibit similar gene distribution patterns. However, their
approaches are targeted at the visual inspection of
genome rearrangement among a few related species and
provide no deterministic strategies for clustering a large
number of genomes based on the conserved patterns.
The methods described above are relevant but are incompatible with our problem because they provide no means
for genome clustering. Consequently, the methods that
we were able to include for algorithm evaluation were
limited. In this work, we are pursuing a method that
solves a genomics problem currently under-addressed in
computational biology. This problem, namely the clustering of genomes based on genomic context, is becoming
more important as the number of sequenced genomes
increases rapidly.
Significance of gene-distribution based clustering for
phages
Phages are taxonomically classified based on the physical
characteristics of their virions, genome size and type; however, no taxonomic levels below that of family can be
defined with this classification system [42]. This complication can be explained by a number of recent observations on phage genomes: a large number of novel
sequences, high genomic mosaicism, and genes being
highly mobile, which have resulted in massive HGT
[10,43]. However, while phage genomes are mosaic overall, subgroups of phages have often been observed with
comparable genome structures. For example, gene order
has been found to be strikingly conserved for structural
and assembly genes in myco- and sipho- phages [43,44].
Their gene order remains strongly conserved even in the
presence of high genetic mosaicism, where genes or gene
clusters are shared among different phages in a reassorted
or mosaic manner [10,45]. Such conservation may be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/116

caused by functional constraints, such as favoring lateral
gene transfer [46] or allowing co-transcription and co-regulation of genes [43,46]. Conservation of gene positions
and relative positions between genes has also been
observed [47,48]. It has been suggested that such positional conservation results from natural selection –
although the recombination events that give rise to mosaicism can happen at random locations in the phage
genomes, natural selection could eliminate unfit phages
and let only those survive who have recombination joints
at selected positions [10,45]. These observations suggest
that gene distribution can provide valuable information
for understanding phage relationships and allow alternative perspectives on phage classification, justifying the
methods we propose in this paper.
Future algorithmic improvement
O-HARP's ability to filter out subsets of dimensions enables additional biological features to be simply appended
to the genome vectors without compromising the similarity measure on the original features. The biological features that deserve future investigations include
transcriptional directionality of genes and the isoelectric
point, hydrophobic region, and molecular weight of the
gene products. These features can potentially enhance the
underlying meaning of a cluster and provide further information for downstream analysis such as the prediction of
function for novel gene groups.

Conclusion
We have proposed the use of an overlapping subspace
clustering algorithm to assist evolutionary study through
objectively classifying genomes based on their resemblance in gene order, gene content and genome positions.
The advantage of subspace clustering over traditional clustering is the ability to associate clusters with gene arrangement patterns, preserving genomic information in the
clusters produced. Additionally, overlapping capability is
desirable for the discovery of multiple conserved patterns
within a single genome, such as those acquired from different species via HGT. We presented O-HARP and demonstrated its significance through evaluation and
application to bacteriophage genomes. The phage clusters
were compatible overall with the Phage Proteomic Tree
and the ICTV classification system, and have enabled
additional observations on Siphophage genomics
through an alternative perspective derived from gene distribution conservation. In general, the proposed method
is suitable for application to genomes with high genetic
exchange and various conserved gene arrangement, and is
potentially exploitable for the detection of prophages in
bacterial genomes.

Methods
Evaluation data
For evaluation, we manually composed a data set that captures several complexities that reflect real data. Firstly,
regarding overlapping complexity, the genomes are chosen such that some of them belong to a single group and
some to multiple groups. The data set contains seven disjoint clusters, upon which six overlapping clusters are
built hierarchically, totaling 13 clusters. Secondly, to capture the complexity in gene distribution, we included various genomes that contain the same set of genes coexisting
in different distributions. We also included distributions
that have the same gene order with varying gene-to-gene
distances. Thirdly, in order to test the algorithm's ability
to distinguish between absolute and relative gene distributions, we included cases where the distributions are
based only on gene-to-gene distances and cases where the
distributions are based on both distances and positions.
Finally, we included outliers to serve as noise. The genes
that we selected to include in the evaluation data set are
major head, major tail, tape measure, prohead protease,
integrase, terminase, portal, holin and lysin genes. They
were selected because of their prevalent existence; many of
these genes appear to be common in Siphoviridae [24],
which constitutes the largest proportion of the observed
DNA phage population. The data is available for download from the project website [9].
Performance measures
The performance of a clustering algorithm is evaluated by
comparing its generated clusters with the model clusters.
We employ a performance measure referred to here as
Subspace Clustering Error (SCE) [8], which formula is
summarized as follows: Let the model clustering be S and
the clustering generated by a target algorithm be S'. The
clusters in S are matched against the clusters in S' and the
number of identical elements between each pair of matching clustering are totaled. The sum is denoted as Dmax. The
union set of elements between S and S' is denoted by U,
and the number of elements |U|. For computing SCE, an
"element" in a cluster corresponds to one datum and one
dimension (which can be thought of an element in a
matrix). We use subscript "S" to denote this:

SCE(S, S′) =

U S − D Smax
US

U and Dmax corresponds only to one datum. We use subscript "R" to denote this.

RCE(S, S′) =

U R − D Rmax
UR

(11)

In subspace clustering, algorithms tend to generate more
clusters than necessary because of a large number of possible intrinsic subspaces. Therefore, we introduce two
more measures, the Coverage Index (CI) and the discrepancy in the number of clusters (DNC). If the number of
clusters in S' is larger than that in S, then after the matching of S and S', a subset of clusters from S' will become
redundant. We denote this subset J. Then CI is defined as
CI(S, S') = SCE(S, S'\J), where S'\J indicates set S' excluding set J. DNC is simply the difference in the number of
clusters between S and S', or the number of redundant
clusters. For SCE, RCE and CI, a score of 0 means perfect
and 1 means worst. For DNC, a value close to zero is also
preferred.

For traditional clustering, a measure only needs to tell
how well data are grouped, as there is no subspace information. We also employ such a measure in our evaluation, called Row Clustering Error (RCE), in order to
compare non-overlapping algorithms as well as to provide auxiliary information about algorithmic performances for the overlapping ones. For RCE, an "element" in
