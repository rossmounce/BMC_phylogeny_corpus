Plasmodial sugar transporters as anti-malarial
drug targets and comparisons with other
protozoa
Ksenija Slavic1,2*, Sanjeev Krishna1, Elvira T Derbyshire1 and Henry M Staines1

Abstract
Glucose is the primary source of energy and a key substrate for most cells. Inhibition of cellular glucose uptake
(the first step in its utilization) has, therefore, received attention as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat various
unrelated diseases including malaria and cancers. For malaria, blood forms of parasites rely almost entirely on
glycolysis for energy production and, without energy stores, they are dependent on the constant uptake of
glucose. Plasmodium falciparum is the most dangerous human malarial parasite and its hexose transporter has
been identified as being the major glucose transporter. In this review, recent progress regarding the validation and
development of the P. falciparum hexose transporter as a drug target is described, highlighting the importance of
robust target validation through both chemical and genetic methods. Therapeutic targeting potential of hexose
transporters of other protozoan pathogens is also reviewed and discussed.
Background - Malaria burden and drug resistance
Today drug-resistant malaria is a persistent global health
threat, resulting in an estimated one million human
deaths worldwide. Of all malarial species, infection with
Plasmodium falciparum is the cause of the greatest
death toll, hitting sub-Saharan Africa hardest. Following
the emergence of chloroquine resistance more than half
a century ago, new drugs were introduced as alternative
treatment regimens. The efficacy of these drugs deteriorated quickly, for some of them at an alarming rate, as
malarial parasites evolved multiple mechanisms of drug
resistance. For example, the first reports of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and atovaquone resistance arrived in
the same year as their introduction [1]. With worsening
resistance to all available anti-malarials in Southeast
Asia, artemisinins, extracted from a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine for over two millennia, found
worldwide application. Artemisinins are highly potent
and safe anti-malarials, which are effective against multidrug-resistant P. falciparum [2-5].
One of the major goals identified to control malaria has
been to prolong the lifespan of existing drugs by using

drug-combination treatments. Artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) today includes artesunatemefloquine, artemether-lumefantrine, artesunateamodiaquine, artesunate-sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine [6]. ACT is currently
recommended by WHO as the first-line treatment for
uncomplicated malaria whereas recommendations for the
treatment of severe malaria include artesunate or quinine
given parenterally, followed by a course of an ACT [6].
Given the essential role of artemisinins in anti-malarial
treatment, it is of great concern that resistance to artemisinins has recently emerged at the Thai-Cambodian border region [7-9]. While immediate action is necessary to
conquer the spread of artemisinin resistance, the development of new tools to tackle malaria is even more
urgent. The availability of the complete P. falciparum
genome has facilitated identification of a series of novel
candidate targets. This includes a large number of solute
transport proteins that are underexploited as potential
anti-malarial targets [10]. Here we describe recent
advances in the development of the P. falciparum hexose
transporter, PfHT, as a novel drug target.

A novel approach to kill the malarial parasite - inhibition
of sugar uptake

Blood is a steady and abundant source of glucose (~ 5
mM mean level) for malarial parasites residing and multiplying inside erythrocytes. Thus, it is not surprising
that blood stages of malarial parasites are dependant on
glucose as their main energy source. In line with this
assumption, when malarial parasites are deprived of glucose, their intracellular ATP levels drop quickly along
with their cytoplasmic pH [11]. Glucose deprivation also
causes depolarization of the parasite plasma membrane
[12]. The main source of ATP production in asexual
blood stages of malarial parasites is glycolysis, which is
followed by anaerobic fermentation of pyruvate to lactate. Although less efficient when compared with cellular respiration, glycolysis provides fast ATP production,
which is required for the rapidly replicating intraerythrocytic parasite. The rate of ATP production by anaerobic glycolysis can be up to 100 times faster than that
of oxidative phosphorylation. The role of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in Plasmodium has long been
a matter of debate. Recently, it has been discovered that,
at least during their asexual blood stages, malarial parasites have atypical, branched TCA metabolism, which is
largely disconnected from glycolysis and therefore plays
a minor role in energy metabolism [13].
Glucose from blood is delivered to the intraerythocytic malarial parasite by sugar transporters present in
the host and the parasite plasma membranes. Glucose
is first transported from blood plasma into the erythrocyte cytosol by GLUT1, the facilitative glucose transporter highly abundant in the erythrocyte plasma
membrane. Facilitative transporters, such as GLUT1,
are passive carriers that move solutes down their concentration gradients [14]. As the malarial parasite
resides inside the erythrocyte surrounded by an additional membrane, the parasitophorous vacuole (PV)
membrane, glucose molecules must pass this membrane before reaching the parasite surface. The parasitophorous vacuole membrane is highly permeable to
glucose and other solutes with molecular weights up to
1400 Da and these molecules pass freely between erythrocyte cytoplasm and the vacuolar space through
high-capacity, low selectivity channels [15,16].
Finally, glucose uptake into the parasite is mediated by
a facilitative transport process [17]. In the case of
P. falciparum, PfHT (PlasmoDB accession number:
PFB0210c) is the principal hexose transporter
expressed in the parasite plasma membrane
(Figure 1A) [18].
PfHT was first identified in the P. falciparum genome
as a putative transporter gene showing homology to the
major mammalian glucose transporter, GLUT1. Similar
to GLUT1, the predicted topology of PfHT comprises

Page 2 of 10

12 transmembrane helices with the amino and carboxy
terminals located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Figure 1B). Expression of PfHT in Xenopus laevis
oocytes, enabled its detailed functional characterization.
PfHT is a sodium-independent, saturable, facilitative
hexose transporter [18]. While PfHT shares some of the
typical sugar transporter features with the major
mammalian glucose transporter, GLUT1, important
mechanistic differences in their interaction with
substrates have been identified. GLUT1 is selective for
D-glucose (Km = 2.4 mM), whereas PfHT can transport
both D-glucose (K m = 1 mM) and D-fructose (K m =
11.5 mM) (see Table 1). Fructose can replace glucose as
an energy source when P. falciparum parasites are cultured in vitro [19]. Fructose gains entry to the red blood
cell through the action of GLUT5, a facilitative fructose
transporter present in the erythrocyte plasma membrane
(Figure 1A) [20]. Uptake and metabolism of fructose
probably do not play a significant physiological role for
malarial parasite asexual blood stages, as plasma fructose
concentrations are much lower than those of glucose,
but may be important during parasite development
inside the mosquito vector.
Mutational analyses of PfHT, together with studies
using a variety of hexose analogues, were performed to
investigate ligand-transporter interactions. Mechanistic
differences that were observed between GLUT1 and
PfHT in terms of their interaction with substrates, suggested that selective inhibition of PfHT may be possible.
Several other features of PfHT favour it as a novel drug
target. Most notably, pfht is a single copy gene without
a close paralogue. The P. falciparum genome encodes
three other proteins, PFI0955 w, PFI0785 c and
PFE1455 w (PlasmoDB accession numbers) that have
been annotated with putative sugar transport function,
but they show considerably diverged amino acid
sequences compared with that of PfHT (≤ 21% amino
acid sequence identity) [21,22]. These putative transporters have not been investigated so far, thus their functions and cellular localizations remain unknown. Based
on our genetic studies of PfHT (described later in this
review), PFI0955 w, PFI0785 c or PFE1455 w do not
function as alternative mechanisms for the delivery of
hexoses as energy substrates for asexual blood stages of
P. falciparum. Lack of functional redundancy is an
important feature when potential drug targets are evaluated and prioritized. Also, a finding that there are no
polymorphisms in PfHT amino acid sequence in eight
laboratory and more than 20 field isolates analysed, adds
value to PfHT as a drug target [23].
In addition to recognized therapeutic potential of
PfHT, transporters that link glycolysis to apicoplast anabolism in malarial parasites may also become interesting
as drug targets. The apicoplast is a relict plastid

organelle that arose from a secondary endosymbiotic
event [24]. This organelle is indispensable for parasite
survival, which makes it attractive for therapeutic targeting. It contains four membranes and, therefore, requires
complex transport systems. Despite being an anabolic
organelle little is known about nutrient transport across
its multiple membranes. Synthesis of fatty acids, isoprene precursors and haem is localized to the apicoplast
and requires reduced carbon compounds and energy to
be functional. The question of how these anabolic processes are fuelled in a non-photosynthetic plastid is of
particular interest. Two transporters have been identified (PfiTPT (PFE1510 c) and PfoTPT (PFE0410 w))
that are localized in the innermost and outermost apicoplast membranes, respectively, and are homologous to
plant transporters that move phosphorylated trioses,
pentoses and hexoses across the chloroplast envelope
in exchange for inorganic phosphate [25]. PfiTPT and
PfoTPT have been proposed to act in tandem to transport glycolytic intermediates from the cytoplasm to the
apicoplast, providing a source of carbon, reducing
power and ATP required for biosynthetic processes
[25]. Recently, using a cell-free transporter assay system, these two transporters have been found to show
equivalent substrate preferences, with high substrate
affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate and lower affinities
for dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 3-phosphoglyceric
acid, supporting the view that they act together to
import these glycolytic intermediates into the apicoplast [26]. By being the link between cytoplasmic glycolysis and apicoplast anabolism, PfiTPT and PfoTPT
are potential drug targets [25], but they require further
validation steps.
Genetic and chemical approaches to target validation

Validation of a particular parasite protein as a potential
drug target can be performed by chemical or genetic
tools. Chemical validation requires identification of a
compound that specifically inhibits the parasite protein
of interest without having an effect on the orthologous
host proteins. Such a selective inhibitor also needs to
demonstrate parasiticidal activity in vitro and/or in vivo.
In certain cases, inhibition of parasite growth in vitro
occurs at inhibitor concentrations lower than those
necessary to block the transporter in a heterologous
expression system. Various factors can account for this
inhibitory difference between the two techniques,
including the level of transporter expression, environmental factors that influence ligand binding (e.g. the
composition of the lipid membrane) and inhibitor accumulation mechanisms.
Genetic validation involves a genetic modification of
the parasite to “knock-out” a gene and show that lossof-function of the protein results in non-viable or

Page 4 of 10

severely disabled parasites [27]. Also, if a specific
inhibitor is available, the parasite can be genetically
modified to over-express the potential target protein. In
this case, demonstration of reduced inhibition with
over-expression of the protein validates that protein as
the molecular target of the applied drug.
Due to high target attrition rates during drug discovery projects, it is desirable that both chemical and
genetic validation data are available for a novel target.
Both of these methods have specific advantages but are
also characterized with certain weaknesses. Chemical
target validation provides information addressing the
key druggability issues of cell permeability, selective
toxicity and drug metabolism [28]. Also, it enables identification of non-protein targets. Genetic approaches, on
the other hand, enable validation of targets with
unknown function or for which highly specific inhibitors
are not available. With the chemical validation
approach, it is sometimes difficult to demonstrate the
correlation between the target inhibition and the phenotype. Genetic validation, therefore, presents the “gold
standard” for providing evidence for an essential function of a protein. Generally, the inability to obtain a
chromosomal null mutant for a certain gene suggests
the essential function of that gene for growth or survival
but to definitely prove this, ‘rescue’ of the chromosomal
null mutant must be achieved through expression of
another copy of the gene. On the other hand, a gene
knock-out that results in the growth of viable parasites
suggests that the gene is not essential and probably not
a drug target. It is important to note, however, that in
certain circumstances it is possible to obtain viable
organisms with the knock-out of an essential gene. This
is possible through the occurrence of genetic changes at
other loci that compensate for the lethal effect of the
knock-out [28], or because in vitro conditions for
growth are more permissive than those pertaining in
vivo. This emphasizes the importance of both genetic
and chemical validation approaches. Spontaneous amplification of an alternative transporter has, for example,
been observed in a Leishmania mexicana glucose transporter null mutant (see below) [29]. Also, a gene that
can be disrupted at one particular life cycle stage of a
parasite may have an essential function during other life
cycle stages.
Chemical validation of PfHT as a drug target

Besides enabling functional studies, an additional value
of the established robust heterologous expression system
of PfHT in X. laevis oocytes was the opportunity to
screen a series of glucose analogues and other compounds for their inhibitory properties. In an early study
and based on previous findings with hexose analogues, a
library of glucose derivatives with varying chain lengths

Slavic et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:165
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/165

at the C-3 position was generated and studied [30]. One
of the compounds, 3-O-[undecyl-10-en]-1-yl-D-glucose,
also known as compound 3361 (Figure 2A), was identified as an effective inhibitor of PfHT-mediated glucose
transport in Xenopus oocytes as well as demonstrating a
high degree of selectivity for PfHT over GLUT1 (see
Table 1). The Ki value of compound 3361 on glucose
uptake by PfHT was found to be 53 μM. Compound
3361 killed P. falciparum in vitro (IC50 of 15 µM) and
also showed activity in an in vivo murine model; a significant suppression of Plasmodium berghei parasitaemia
was shown in a standard four-day suppression test [30].
These studies chemically validated PfHT as a novel drug
target. Demonstration that compound 3361 acts via
inhibition of transport rather than affecting the metabolism of glucose came from a study that measured uptake
of non-metabolizable glucose analogues in P. falciparum
parasites freed from erythrocytes by saponin lysis [31].
The therapeutic potential of PfHT has been further
supported by findings that its orthologues in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi are susceptible to
inhibition by compound 3361 [32]. This compound also
kills short-term cultures of P. vivax isolated from
patients [32]. These findings suggest that if anti-malarials based on the inhibition of hexose transport are
developed, they could be used for the treatment of nonfalciparum malarias as well.
Later studies, using the Xenopus expression system of
PfHT, further investigated inhibitory properties of
sugar-based derivatives. A 3-O-substituted chain length
of between 8-13 carbons is necessary to maintain inhibitory activity against PfHT [33]. Also, repositioning of
the O-[undecyl-10-en]-1-yl substituent at C2 in the glucose molecule produced a significantly higher affinity
inhibitor (Ki of 2 μM against PfHT, see Figure 2B) compared with the C3 derivative, compound 3361 [34].
Similar to compound 3361, 2-O-[undecyl-10-en]-1-yl-Dglucose retained selective inhibitory activity against
PfHT over GLUT1 and also inhibited P. falciparum
growth in vitro [34].
PfHT can also be inhibited by compounds that do not
have glucose-based structures. Recently, we have
explored inhibitory potential of catechins, flavonoid

compounds naturally found in green tea, against parasite
and mammalian hexose transporters [35]. This study
was driven by findings that some catechins inhibit
mammalian GLUT1 and also show anti-malarial properties [36,37]. As with GLUT1, it was found that catechins
containing a gallate group (epicatechin-gallate and epigallocatechin-gallate) inhibit PfHT and mammalian
GLUT5. However, although these compounds inhibited
hexose uptake processes in infected erythrocytes, the
primary mechanism of their anti-malarial activity probably involves interaction with alternative higher affinity
target/s [35].
Genetic validation of essential function of PfHT for
asexual blood stages

To add further support for PfHT as a novel drug target,
pfht was investigated using genetic tools. Since the
malarial parasite is haploid for a greater part of its life
cycle (except for the short zygote and ookinete stages
inside the mosquito midgut), reverse genetic studies of
an essential gene are not straightforward, as the knockout of such a gene would have a lethal effect. Therefore,
in genetic studies of pfht, a knock-out/complementation
system was used, which has been successfully used in
research of P. falciparum kinases [38]. With this
approach, a knock-out of a gene of interest is attempted
with or without the presence of a complementation vector that allows episomal, “rescue”, expression of the
gene of interest. If the gene is essential, its knock-out
would be lethal for the parasite and will only be
achieved in the presence of a rescuing, complementation
vector. In this way, it was established that pfht is essential for survival of asexual blood stages [39]. Additionally, a transgenic P. falciparum line overexpressing pfht
is less susceptible to growth inhibition by compound
3361 compared with wild-type parasites. This transgenic
line may represent a useful tool to link activities of
future putative PfHT inhibitors to the target. The essential function of the hexose transporter for survival of
blood stages was confirmed in a rodent malarial model,
P. berghei. The P. berghei hexose transporter gene pbht (PlasmoDB accession number: PB000562.01.0), is
accessible for genetic targeting, as shown by gfp-tagging
of the gene, but is refractory to knock-out attempts [39].
Recently, this finding has been reproduced, using a similar genetic approach [40].
Therefore, PfHT has been validated as a drug target
both chemically and genetically, and so far it is the only
transport protein for which both validation approaches
have been undertaken.
Life cycle studies

In addition to an essential function of PfHT for asexual
blood stages of the malarial parasite, this transporter is

Slavic et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:165
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/165

also important for parasite development and/or survival
at other stages of its complex life cycle. This has been
investigated using transgenic P. berghei lines, amenable
to in vivo life cycle studies. PbHT expression was analysed by direct imaging of live parasites expressing
PbHT fused to a GFP reporter [39,41] and by immunofluorescence analysis of a transgenic line expressing
PbHT fused to the haemagglutinin epitope [40]. PbHT
was constitutively expressed throughout the parasite’s
development inside the mosquito vector as well as during the hepatic stages (see Figure 3 for examples). This
is in keeping with previous transcriptomic and proteomic studies [42-46].
Glucose transport by plasmodial hexose transporters is
necessary for normal development of insect stages
(microgametes, ookinetes and oocysts), as shown by
inhibitory studies with compound 3361. Compound
3361 reduced the number of oocysts formed inside
infected mosquito midguts, when tested using a membrane feed assay [41] as well as when mosquitoes were

Page 6 of 10

fed on compound 3361 treated, P. berghei-infected mice
[40]. Compound 3361 also affects exflagellation of male
gametes and ookinete production in a dose-dependant
manner with IC 50 values of between 100 to 300 μM
[40,41], although only the former in a glucose-sensitive
manner [41]. PfHT targeting thus holds some potential
for transmission blocking strategies. The only current
drugs that can kill P. falciparum gametocytes and, thus,
reduce transmission are 8-aminoquinolines, such as primaquine [47]. The use of primaquine is hampered by
the haemolysis this drug causes in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
[48]. Artemisinins inhibit early stages of gametocyte
development.
Liver stages of the malarial parasite are also killed by
compound 3361 (with an IC 50 of 11 μM) [40,41]. This
effect was not due to reduced viability of the host hepatoma cells or to inhibition of host glucose uptake pathways
[41]. These data suggest that novel chemotherapeutic
interventions that target PfHT may well be active against

pattern of staining is consistent with localization of PbHT to the parasite plasma membrane, which invaginates around clusters of nuclei during
the formation of merozoites. GFP, pbht-gfp P. berghei; HOE, Hoechst 33342 (used as a nuclear dye); BF, bright-field image.

liver stages. Efficacy against malarial parasite liver stages
has gained increasing attention as a desirable property of
new anti-malarials [49]. Drugs that act at this stage, preventing sporozoite infection or replication of parasites in
the liver, stop the infection from reaching the symptomatic
blood stages. Since very limited number of drugs have this
causal prophylactic activity (namely primaquine, proguanil
and atovaquone), it is important to identify novel potential
strategies.
High throughput screening systems

After a target has been robustly validated, the next step
of its development as a drug target requires a high
throughput system for the screening of compound
libraries. A promising system for functional expression
of parasite and human glucose transporters has recently
been developed based on a glucose transporter null
mutant of Leishmania mexicana, named Δlmgt [50,51].
PfHT, T. brucei hexose transporter THT1 and human
GLUT1 have been successfully expressed in Δlmgt heterologous system. It was demonstrated that functional
complementation of Δlmgt with parasite and human
transporters can be used to identify inhibitory compounds specific for parasite glucose transporters [50].
An advantage of Δlmgt as an expression system compared with mammalian cells is the absence of background glucose uptake. This background, characteristic
for mammalian cells due to the presence of multiple
endogenous glucose transporters, may affect the inhibition data obtained during experiments. The Δlmgt system is amenable to high throughput screening by using
a cell-permeable dye, alamarBlue™, which is reduced by
viable parasites and in its reduced form emits a strong
fluorescence signal that is a quantitative measure of the
parasite count [50]. Recent expression of PfHT in a
yeast mutant cell line deficient in endogenous hexose
transporters may potentially be useful in high-throughput studies of inhibitors [40], although this system
requires further validation, including comparisons to
yeast mutants expressing mammalian glucose transporters as well as development of a screening assay
methodology.
Several thousand new chemical entities with in vitro
activity against both sensitive and multidrug resistant P.
falciparum were discovered recently [52,53]. These
newly identified libraries of active compounds may serve
as an excellent starting point for target-based lead discovery, which has not produced satisfactory results so
far, mostly due to lack of whole-cell activity [52].
Potential of glucose transporters of other
pathogens as drug targets

In addition to malarial parasites, the uptake of glucose is
essential for the viability of several other protozoan

Page 7 of 10

pathogens. This has been established for Trypanosoma
brucei, a pathogen causing sleeping sickness. Sleeping
sickness is fatal if untreated and novel trypanocides are
required because current treatments are not satisfactory
due to a lack of efficacy, poor safety profiles, difficulties
in administration and/or high cost [54]. Glycolysis has
been considered a promising target for new drugs against
trypanosomiasis. The reason for this, in addition to glycolysis being essential for the survival of blood stage
parasites, is the unique nature of this pathway in Trypanosoma [54]. The first seven reactions of the glycolytic
pathway happen inside peroxisome-like organelles called
glycosomes and the enzymes involved display unique
structural and kinetic properties, which are distinct from
those of the mammalian host. Glucose uptake in T. brucei happens via two glucose transporters, THT1 and
THT2 (Trypanosoma hexose transporter 1 and 2) (Table
1). The lower glucose affinity THT1 (Km ~1 mM), is the
isoform expressed in the blood stages, whereas the highaffinity THT2 (Km ~0.05 mM) is expressed during insect
stages. Glucose and fructose analogues can inhibit glucose uptake by THT1 and kill the blood forms of T. brucei [55]. THT1, therefore, may represent a good drug
target and its heterologous expression, which has been
achieved in the L. mexicana glucose transporter null
mutant mentioned before, may facilitate the search for a
specific inhibitory compound [50].
Glucose is also an essential nutrient for the infectious
stages of L. mexicana, an intracellular parasite of macrophages, which causes cutaneous leishmaniasis. The
uptake of glucose is essential for proliferation of diseasecausing amastigote stages of L. mexicana [56]. Glucose
uptake in L. mexicana is mediated by three glucose
transporter isoforms, LmGT1, LmGT2 and LmGT3
(Leishmania mexicana glucose transporter 1, 2 and 3)
(Table 1) [56]. The three glucose transporter isoforms
are very similar in their protein sequences but they have
specific subcellular localizations and display developmentally-regulated expression [56,57]. The importance
of hexose transport for infectious stages of L. mexicana
has been further supported by a recent discovery of
spontaneous suppressors of the glucose transporter null
mutant, Δlmgt [29]. These suppressor mutants have
regained the ability to transport hexoses through an
amplification of an alternative glucose transporter gene,
the LmGT4 permease, and have also partially restored
virulence [29]. Thus, although inhibition of L. mexicana
glucose transporters has not been investigated (in the
way it has been done for P. falciparum and T. brucei
hexose transporters, using glucose analogue-based inhibitors), interference with their function may show therapeutic potential.
Babesia are tick-borne haemoprotozoan apicomlexan
parasites, sharing many similarities, including their

Slavic et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:165

asexual blood-stage proliferation with Plasmodium.
Babesia bovis causes severe infections in cattle and
imposes a high economic burden. Babesia bovis hexose
transporter 1 - BboHT1 (Table 1), one of the two
hexose transporters identified in the genome of this
parasite, has been expressed and characterized in Xenopus oocytes [58]. BboHT1 is approximately 10-fold
more sensitive to inhibition by compound 3361 compared with PfHT but this compound does not affect
parasite growth [58]. It is possible that compound 3361
may not reach the intraerythrocytic site of BboHT1 or
that another D-glucose transport pathway, insensitive to
compound 3361, is present [58]. Alternatively, the parasite may not rely completely on glucose as an energy
source. The authors have suggested that the parasites
may oxidize glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase,
which is present in blood stages, and feed the resulting
a-ketoglutarate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle [58].
Evidence obtained so far, therefore, cannot support
BboHT1 as a drug target.
Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite
of the Apicomplexa phylum related to Plasmodium,
can tolerate the deletion of its surface sugar transporter without an effect on its virulence [59]. The authors
of this study have suggested that in T. gondii glucose
metabolism is dispensable because of glutaminolysis.
The ability to use alternative energy sources has probably co-evolved with the ability of these parasites to
replicate in most cell types. Thus, phylogenetically closely related parasites, such as Toxoplasma, Babesia and
Plasmodium, can fundamentally differ in terms of their
dependence on glucose and essentiality of their glucose
transporters. During their life cycles, the ability of
some parasites to use alternative energy sources may
depend on the specific life cycle stage. For example,
insect stages of T. brucei (procyclic forms) and L. mexicana (promastigotes) can thrive in glucose-depleted
medium [60,61], whereas the growth of their mammalian stages is dependant on glucose (as described
above).

Conclusions
Hexose transporters of the three most pathogenic
malarial parasites, P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi, have been validated as novel drug targets. In addition to an essential role of plasmodial hexose
transporters during parasite blood stages, these transporters may also have a crucial role for liver and insect
stages of malarial parasite life cycles (see Figure 4 for
summary).
Glucose transport has also been found to be essential
for the viability of T. brucei and L. mexicana infectious
stages. Thus, inhibition of hexose transport may present

Figure 4 Schematic representation of the life cycle of
Plasmodium parasites showing a summary of inhibition and
expression studies of plasmodial hexose transporters. Parasites
shown in green represent a pbht-gfp transgenic line, which has
been analysed via direct fluorescence imaging. Using this transgenic
line, expression of PbHT-GFP was observed at 24, 48 and 67 h post
infection in the liver stage [41], in both early and late asexual blood
stages, in sexual blood stage forms (gametocytes) and in female
gametes/or zygotes, ookinetes, midgut oocysts and sporozoites
derived from mosquito midgut oocysts and salivary glands [39].
Highlighted life cycle stages (blue boxes) show where compound
3361 inhibits parasite growth and development; in the liver stages
in vitro, P. berghei parasite growth is inhibited by compound 3361
with an IC50 value of 11 μM [41]; in the asexual blood stages in
vitro, P. falciparum parasite growth is inhibited by compound 3361
with an IC50 value of 16 μM and in vivo P. berghei parasite growth is
reduced by 40% (4-day suppression test; 25 mg/kg; administered i.p.
twice daily) [30]; in P. berghei sexual stages male gametogenesis
(IC50 value of 286 μM) and ookinete production (IC50 value of 252
μM) are inhibited by compound 3361 [41].

an attractive approach in the development of other new
anti-parasitic drugs, in addition to the discovery of novel
anti-malarials.
