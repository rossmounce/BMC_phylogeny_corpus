Abstract
Background: Accessory ADM was first reported in 1868 although muscular, vascular and nervous
variations of the hypothenar eminence are rare, contrary to anomalous muscles in the wrist which
are relatively common.
Case presentation: This case report presents a bilateral variation of an accessory abductor digiti
minimi muscle in a male specimen. Ulnar artery and ulnar nerves were taken into account regarding
their position and trajectory related to this variation.
Conclusion: Muscle size may be an important factor in considering whether a variation is able to
produce neurovascular compression and clinical implications.

Background
This case report presents an abductor digiti minimi
(ADM) muscle's bilateral accessory head, involving ulnar
artery (UA) and ulnar nerve (UN) trajectories' sensorial
and motor components. Although muscular, vascular and
nervous variations of the hypothenar eminence are rare
(differing from anomalous muscles in the wrist), they
have been reported [1-10]. According to Sheppard, three
cases of accessory ADM were first reported by Wood in
1868. Most authors call such additional ADM head an
"accessory" component which can be unilaterally or bilaterally presented, producing compression in Guyon's
canal. Harvie et al., found an accessory ADM in 41% of
116 volunteers' asymptomatic ultrasound examinations,
greater prevalence being found in male samples and bilateral presentation in 50% of cases for both genders.

The flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle can also be present
in this area; Madhavi et al., have stated that it relates to the
common phylogeny of these muscles from the same muscle mass [11]. Soldado-Carrera et al., found this variation
to be associated with decreased flexor digitorum superficialis muscle fourth tendon caliper and median nerve
split. Murata [7] found an accessory ADM in 35 hands,
having one (17%), two (80%) and three fascicles (3%).
Furthermore, Wulle [8] presented eleven cases of accessory ADM, but having "longus" presentation.

Case presentation
This case report arises from one cadaver specimen
amongst a sample of thirty which were obtained from
Universidad Industrial de Santander's Medical Faculty's
Anatomy Department (dissection laboratory) during
2006 academic semesters. The specimen was fixed in 10%
formaldehyde solution. Dissections were performed by

the authors, involving the antebrachial and hand dorsal
and ventral area. The hypothenar area was carefully dissected following vascular and nervous structures neighbouring the ADM's accessory head. These findings were
recorded and photographed (digital camera and an electronic Mitutoyo calliper) according to UN side and collateral origin, UA vascular distribution and muscular
variation. The left hand (Figure 1) presented an accessory
ADM head originating in antebrachial fascia and palmaris
longus tendon. According to Murata et al., [7] classification resembles "variation 2", however without additional
palmaris longus tendon origin. It passed obliquely
through Guyon's canal, enclosing the UN and vessels. The
accessory head had a late union in its distal trajectory to
form a single pennate with the ADM originating in pisiform bone. It was localized over the flexor digiti minimi
brevis muscle and lateral to opponens digiti minimi muscle. Left variation length was 50.6 mm, 11.65 mm wide
and 2.43 mm thick compared to the ADM ipsilateral usual
head which was 55.9 mm, 13.03 mm wide and 7.09 mm
thick. This left accessory ADM head had 34.3% of the
thickness of a usual ADM head. UN and UA were covered
by this ADM accessory head. Sensorial UN branches had
both superficial and deep trajectories regarding muscular
variation and were presented in relation to their trajectory
as superficial sensory branch trajectory coming from the
ulnar nerve's dorsal cutaneous branch and a deep sensory
branch trajectory coming from the ulnar trunk. These
abnormal ulnar nerve branches fitted Kaplan's variation
type 4 according to Hankins et al. [12]. Kaplan's accessory
branch (considered a rare anatomic variant) together with
accessory ADM in the same case have never been reported

in the literature. They were connected after coursing the
accessory ADM head. A third sensorial trajectory course
was observed toward the fourth finger after passing
Guyon's canal as the "fourth common digital nerve". The
right hand (Figure 2) also presented an accessory ADM
head originating in the flexor retinaculum and palmaris
longus tendon. According to Murata et al., [7] classification resembles "variation 1" however without additional
palmaris longus tendon origin. It also passed obliquely
through Guyon's canal, enclosing the UN. This accessory
head also had a late union in its distal trajectory to form a
single pennate with the ADM originating in pisiform
bone. It was also localized over the flexor digiti minimi
brevis muscle and lateral to opponens digiti minimi muscle. Right hand variation length was 37.64 mm, 8.59 mm
wide and 3.71 mm thick compared to the usual ipsilateral
ADM head which was 57.7 mm, 13.1 mm wide and 6.92
mm thick. This accessory ADM head had 45.8% of the
thickness of a usual ADM head. The UA adopted a superficial course above the accessory ADM head while the UN
and all its sensorial branches were covered by this variation. According to UN arborisation patterns by Murata et
al., [7] it looked like a "type 4" classification. These accessory ADM heads received deep UN branch motor innervations on both sides.
This class of muscular variation entrapping neuro-vascular bundles may have sensorial and/or muscular implications in a range of compression neuropathies [5,6].
Entrapment neuropathies can produce heterotopic projected pain, symptomatic consequences arising from
mechanical nerve injury passing through a narrow anatomical space or under a muscular structure which may

potentially compress the neuro-vascular package [13-15].
We think that muscle size, tightness and course may be
important factors in considering whether such variations
are able to produce compression.
This scenario can cause nerve oedema and ischemia by
muscle structure friction over the peryneuro which can
cause neuritis and raise endoneural pressure. Involvement
of vegetative contributions must be taken into account
when assessing the effects of such sensorial injuries, due
to their ability to produce complex pain syndromes
[16,17]. In addition to traumatic neuropathic pain, symptoms in distal nerve distribution (dysesthesia, paresthesia
and anaesthesia), paresis, hyporeflex, hypotonicity and
atrophy, such as inferior motor neuron lesion, may be
equally feasible [18,19]. The deep UN motor branch may
be compressed by this ADM accessory head and compromise palmar and dorsal interosseous muscles, hypothenar
eminence muscles, lumbricals III and IV and hallux
adductor, thereby producing a clinical "claw hand"
appearance or resembling Guyon's canal syndrome.
Having dealt with this variation's possible sensorial and
motor effects, vascular effects must also be considered. UA
compression (left hand) may produce peripheral vascular
disease from two possible events depending on the type of
compression (i.e. constant or intermittent muscular compression). Muscular hyperfunction can reduce these arterial branches' distal irrigation, causing hypoesthesia or
hyperesthesia in the hand. Likewise, muscular spasm can
produce anaerobic metabolism and consequent nerve irritation by anoxic acidified setting with neurogenic inflammation and peripheral hyperalgesia [20,21]. Permanent
loss of vascular supply during muscular spasm can lead to
vascular claudication and pain [22,23].

whether such variation is able to produce UN compression at Guyon's canal or UA compression resulting in a
poor relationship between blood-flow and artery diameter. A larger sample of cadaver specimens is needed. Also,
further clinical studies are required to confirm the existence of these variations' clinical effects.

We believe (from a functional perspective) that precipitating factors (gender, occupation, side dominance, traumatic history, anatomical characteristics) may develop
neurovascular compression and symptoms in an anomalous muscle; we thus present this anatomical case. The
morphological characteristics led to all the above
explained symptomatic possibilities; however, lacking
clinical judgment, further statements lose their functional
value and become merely speculative.

Conclusion
Muscular variations compromising neurovascular bundles may produce clinical symptoms such as dysaesthesic
pain, sensory loss, wakefulness and paresis, highlighting
these anatomical discrepancies' importance when they are
presented. However, the existence of an accessory ADM is
usually asymptomatic and only rarely results in nerve
compression. It does appear that muscle size, tightness
and course may be an important factor in considering
