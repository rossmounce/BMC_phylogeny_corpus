Abstract
Background: Comparative analysis of RNA sequences is the basis for the detailed and accurate
predictions of RNA structure and the determination of phylogenetic relationships for organisms
that span the entire phylogenetic tree. Underlying these accomplishments are very large, wellorganized, and processed collections of RNA sequences. This data, starting with the sequences
organized into a database management system and aligned to reveal their higher-order structure,
and patterns of conservation and variation for organisms that span the phylogenetic tree, has been
collected and analyzed. This type of information can be fundamental for and have an influence on
the study of phylogenetic relationships, RNA structure, and the melding of these two fields.
Results: We have prepared a large web site that disseminates our comparative sequence and
structure models and data. The four major types of comparative information and systems available
for the three ribosomal RNAs (5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and two of the
catalytic intron RNAs (group I and group II) are: (1) Current Comparative Structure Models; (2)
Nucleotide Frequency and Conservation Information; (3) Sequence and Structure Data; and (4)
Data Access Systems.
Conclusions: This online RNA sequence and structure information, the result of extensive
analysis, interpretation, data collection, and computer program and web development, is accessible
at our Comparative RNA Web (CRW) Site [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu] . In the future, more
data and information will be added to these existing categories, new categories will be developed,
and additional RNAs will be studied and presented at the CRW Site.

Background
In the 1830's, Charles Darwin's investigation of the Galapagos finches led to an appreciation of the structural characteristics that varied and were conserved among the birds
in this landmark comparative study. His analysis of the
finches' structural features was the foundation for his theory on the origin and evolution of biological species [1].
Today, 150 years later, our understanding of cells from a
molecular perspective, in parallel with the technological
advances in nucleic acid sequencing and computer hardware and software, affords us the opportunity to determine and study the sequences for many genes from a
comparative perspective, followed by the computational
analysis, cataloging, and presentation of the resulting data
on the World Wide Web.
In the 1970's, Woese and Fox revisited Darwinian evolution from a molecular sequence and structure perspective.
Their two primary objectives were to determine phylogenetic relationships for all organisms, including those that
can only be observed with a microscope, using a single
molecular chronometer, the ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and
to predict the correct structure for an RNA molecule, given
that the number of possible structure models can be larger
than the number of elemental particles in the universe.
For the first objective, they rationalized that the origin of
species and the related issue of the phylogenetic relationships for all organisms are encoded in the organism's rRNA, a molecule that encompasses two-thirds of the mass
of the bacterial ribosome (ribosomal proteins comprise
the other one-third). One of their first and most significant findings was the discovery of the third kingdom of
life, the Archaebacteria (later renamed Archaea) [2–4].
Subsequently, the analysis of ribosomal RNA produced
the first phylogenetic tree, based on the analysis of a single
molecule, that included prokaryotes, protozoa, fungi,
plants, and animals [4]. These accomplishments were the
foundation for the subsequent revolution in rRNA-based
phylogenetic analysis, which has resulted in the sequencing of more than 10,000 16S and 16S-like rRNA and
1,000 23S and 23S-like rRNA genes, from laboratories trying to resolve the phylogenetic relationships for organisms that occupy different sections of the big phylogenetic
tree.
The prediction of tRNA structure with a comparative perspective in the 1960's [5–9] and subsequent validation
with tRNA crystal structures [10,11] established the foundation for Woese and Fox in the 1970's to begin predicting 5S rRNA structure from the analysis of multiple
sequences. They realized that all sequences within the
same functional RNA class (in this case, 5S rRNA) will
form the same secondary and tertiary structure. Thus, for
all of the possible RNA secondary and tertiary structures
for any one RNA sequence, such as for Escherichia coli 5S

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

rRNA, the correct structure for this sequence will be similar to the correct secondary structure for every other 5S
rRNA sequence [12,13].
While the first complete 16S rRNA sequence was determined for E. coli in 1978 [14], the first covariation-based
structure models were not predicted until more 16S rRNA
sequences were determined [15–17]. The first 23S rRNA
sequence was determined for E. coli in 1980 [18]; the first
covariation-based structure models were predicted the following year, once a few more complete 23S rRNA sequences were determined [19–21]. Both of these
comparative structure models were improved as the
number of sequences with different patterns of variation
increased and the covariation algorithms were able to resolve different types and extents of covariation (see below). Initially, the alignments of 16S and 23S rRNA
sequences were analyzed for the occurrence of G:C, A:U,
or G:U base pairs that occur within potential helices in the
16S [15,22] and 23S [19] rRNAs. The 16S and 23S rRNA
covariation-based structure models have undergone numerous revisions [23–28]. Today, with a significantly larger number of sequences and more advanced covariation
algorithms, we search for all positional covariations, regardless of the types of pairings and the proximity of those
pairings with other paired and unpaired nucleotides. The
net result is a highly refined secondary and tertiary covariation-based structure model for 16S and 23S rRNA. While
the majority of these structure models contain standard
G:C, A:U, and G:U base-pairings arranged into regular secondary structure helices, there were many novel base-pairing exchanges (e.g., U:U <-> C:C; A:A <-> G:G; G:U <->
A:C; etc.) and base pairs that form tertiary or tertiary-like
structural elements. Thus, the comparative analysis of the
rRNA sequences and structures has resulted in the prediction of structure and the identification of structural motifs
[29].
Beyond the comparative structure analysis of the three ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNA, several other RNAs have
been studied with this perspective. These include the
group I [30–33] and II [34,35] introns, RNase P [36–38],
telomerase RNA [39,40], tmRNA [41], U RNA [42], and
the SRP RNA [43]. The comparative sequence analysis paradigm has been successful in determining structure over
this wide range of RNA molecules.
Very recently, the authenticities of the ribosomal RNA
comparative structure models have been determined
[Gutell et al., manuscript in preparation]: 97–98% of the
secondary and tertiary structure base pairs predicted with
covariation analysis are present in the crystal structures for
the 30S [44] and 50S [45] ribosomal subunits. Thus, the
underlying premise for comparative analysis and our implementation of this method, including the algorithms,

the sequence alignments, and the large collection of comparative structure models with different structural variations for each of the different RNA molecules (e.g., 16S
and 23S rRNAs) have been validated.
The highly refined and accurate analysis of phylogenetic
relationships and RNA structure with comparative analysis can require very large, phylogenetically and structurally
diverse data sets that contain raw and analyzed data that
is organized for further analysis and interpretation. With
these requirements for our own analysis, and the utility of
this comparative information for the greater scientific
community, we have been assembling, organizing, analyzing, and disseminating this comparative information.
Initially, a limited amount of sequence and comparative
structure information was available online for our 16S
(and 16S-like) [46,47] and 23S (and 23S-like) ribosomal
RNAs [48–52] and the group I introns [33]. In parallel,
two other groups have been providing various forms of ribosomal RNA sequence and structure data (the RDP/RDP
II [53,54] and Belgium (5S/5.8S [55], small subunit
[56,57] and large subunit [58,59]) groups). With significant increases in the amount of sequences available for
the RNAs under study here, improved programs for the
analysis of this data, and better web presentation software, we have established a new "Comparative RNA Web"
(CRW) Site [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/] . This resource has been available to the public since January
2000.

routinely referred to the actual web pages and the corresponding highlights on the "Table of Contents."
1. Comparative structure models
1A. Current structure models for reference organisms
The first major category, Comparative Structure Models
[http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/CSI/2STR/]
contains
our most recent 16S and 23S rRNA covariation-based
structure models, which were adapted from the original
Noller & Woese models (16S [15,22] and 23S [19] rRNA),
and the structure models for 5S rRNA [12], tRNA [5–9],
and the group I [32] and group II [34] introns, as determined by others. This collection of RNA structure models
was predicted with covariation analysis, as described at
the CRW Site Methods Section [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/METHODS/] and in several publications
(see below).

3. "Group I Intron Lateral Transfer Between Red and
Brown Algal Ribosomal RNA" [69].

Briefly, covariation analysis, a specific application of comparative analysis (as mentioned earlier), searches for helices and base pairs that are conserved in different
sequences that form the same functionally equivalent
molecule (e.g., tRNA sequences). It was determined very
early in this methodology that the correct helix is the one
that contains positions within a potential helix that vary
in composition while maintaining G:C, A:U, and G:U
base pairs. As more sequences for a given molecule were
determined, we developed newer algorithms that
searched for positions in an alignment of homologous sequences that had similar patterns of variation. This latter
implementation of the covariation analysis helped us refine the secondary and tertiary structure models by eliminating previously proposed base pairs that are not
underscored with positional covariation and identifying
new secondary and tertiary structure base pairs that do
have positional covariation [19,70–72]. Our newest covariation analysis methods associate color-coded confidence ratings with each proposed base pair (see reference
structure diagrams and Section 2A, "Nucleotide Frequency Tabular Display," for more details). One exception to
this is the tRNA analysis, which was initially performed
with the Mixy chi-square-based algorithm [71], and thus
the color codes are based on that analysis.

The contents of our Comparative RNA Web (CRW) Site
are outlined on its main page [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/] (Figure 1). The detailed explanations of the data
and their presentations in the first four sections of this site
(1. Comparative Structure Models; 2. Nucleotide Frequency and Conservation Information; 3. Sequence and Structure Data; and 4. Data Access Systems) are presented here.
To fully appreciate this description of the CRW Site, we
encourage users to evaluate the pages at this web site while
reading this manuscript; while a few of the pages and links
at the CRW Site are shown as figures here, the reader is

When implemented properly, covariation analysis can
predict RNA structure with extreme accuracy. All of the
secondary structure base pairs and a few of the tertiary
structure base pairs predicted with covariation analysis
[5–9,71–74] are present in the tRNA crystal structure
[10,11]. The analysis of fragments of 5S rRNA [75] and the
group I intron [76] resulted in similar levels of success.
Most recently, the high-resolution crystal structures for
the 30S [44] and 50S [45] ribosomal subunits have given
us the opportunity to evaluate our rRNA structure models.
Approximately 97–98% of the 16S and 23S rRNA base

pairs predicted with covariation analysis are in these crystal structures (Gutell et al., manuscript in preparation).
This congruency between the comparative model and the
crystal structure validates the comparative approach, the
covariation algorithms, the accuracy of the juxtapositions
of sequences in the alignments, and the accuracy of all of
the comparative structure models presented herein and
available at the CRW Site. However, while nearly all of the
base pairs predicted with comparative analysis are present
in the crystal structure solution, some interactions in the
crystal structure, which are mostly tertiary interactions, do
not have similar patterns of variation at the positions that
interact (Gutell et al., manuscript in preparation). Thus,
covariation analysis is unable to predict many of the tertiary base pairings in the crystal structure, although it does
identify nearly all of the secondary structure base pairings.
Beyond the base pairs predicted with covariation analysis,
comparative analysis has been used to predict some structural motifs that are conserved in structure although they
do not necessarily have similar patterns of variation at the
two paired positions. Our analyses of these motifs are
available in the "Structure, Motifs, and Folding" section of
our CRW Site.

Symbols Used In This Diagram:

While the secondary structure models for the 16S, 23S and
5S rRNAs, group I and II introns, and tRNA are available
at the "Current Structure Models for Reference Organisms" page, our primary focus has been on the 16S and
23S rRNAs. Thus, some of our subsequent analysis and interpretation will emphasize only these two RNAs.
Each RNA structure model presented here is based upon a
single reference sequence, chosen as the most representative for that molecule (Table 1); for example, E. coli is the
preferred choice as the reference sequence for rRNA (5S,
16S, and 23S), based on the early and continued research
on the structure and functions of the ribosome [77,78].
Each of the six structure models (5S, 16S and 23S rRNA,
group I and II introns, and tRNA) in the "Current Structure Models for Reference Organisms" page [http://
www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/CSI/2STR/] contains six or seven different diagrams for that molecule: Nucleotide, Tentative, Helix Numbering, Schematic, Histogram, Circular,
and Matrix of All Possible Helices.
Nucleotide: The standard format for the secondary structure diagrams with nucleotides (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C)
reveals our confidence for each base pair, as predicted by
covariation analysis. Base pairs with a red identifier ("-"
for G:C and A:U base pairs, small closed circles for G:U,
large open circles for A:G, and large closed circles for any
other base pair) have the greatest amount of covariation;
thus, we have the most confidence in these predicted base
pairs. Base pairs with a green, black, grey, or blue identifier

and every 50th nucleotide is numbered.

Tertiary interactions with strong comparative data are connected by
solid lines.

have progressively lower covariation scores and are predicted due to the high percentages of A:U + G:C and/or
G:U at these positions. The most current covariationbased E. coli 16S and 23S rRNA secondary structure models are shown in Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C. Note that the majority of the base pairs in the 16S and 23S rRNA have a red
base pair symbol, our highest rating. These diagrams are
the culmination of twenty years of comparative analysis.
Approximately 8500 16S and 16S-like rRNA sequences
and 1050 23S and 23S-like rRNA sequences were collected
from all branches of the phylogenetic tree, as shown in
Section 2, "Nucleotide Frequency and Conservation Information" and in Table 2. These sequences have been
aligned and analyzed with several covariation algorithms,
as described in more detail in the "Predicting RNA Structure with Comparative Methods" section of the CRW Site

third, named "bpseq," is a simple text format that contains the sequence, one nucleotide per line, its position
number, and the position number of the pairing partner
(or 0 if that nucleotide is unpaired in the covariationbased structure model).
Tentative: In addition to the 16S and 23S rRNA structure
models, we have also identified some base pairs in the 16S
and 23S rRNAs that have a lower, although significant, extent of covariation. These are considered 'tentative' and
are shown on separate 16S and 23S rRNA secondary structure diagrams
[http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/CSI/
2STR/] . These base pairs and base triples have fewer coordinated changes (or positional covariations) and/or a
higher number of sequences that do not have the same
pattern of variation present at the other paired position.
Consequently, we have less confidence in these putative
interactions, in contrast with the interactions predicted in
our main structure models.
The Helix Numbering secondary structure diagrams illustrate our system for uniquely and unambiguously numbering each helix in a RNA molecule. Based upon the
numbering of the reference sequence, each helix is named
for the position number at the 5' end of the 5' half of the

Y

helix. For example, the first 16S rRNA helix, which spans
E. coli positions 9–13/21–25, is named "9;" the helix at
positions 939–943/1340–1344 is named "939." This
numbering system is used in the Nucleotide Frequency
Tabular Display tables (see below). The Schematic versions of the reference structure diagrams replace the nucleotides with a line traversing the RNA backbone.
The "Histogram" and "Circular" diagram formats [http:/
/www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/CSI/2STR/] both abstract the
global arrangement of the base pairs. For the histogram
version (Figure 2D), the sequence is displayed as a line
from left (5') to right (3'), with the secondary structure
base pairs shown in blue above the sequence line; below
this line, tertiary structure base pairs and base triples are
shown in red and green, respectively. The distance from
the baseline to the interaction line is proportional to the
distance between the two interacting positions within the
RNA sequence. In contrast, in the circular diagram, the sequence is drawn clockwise (5' to 3') in a circle, starting at
the top. Secondary and tertiary base-base interactions are
shown with lines traversing the circle, using the same
coloring scheme as in the histogram diagram. The global
arrangement and higher-order organization of the base
pairs predicted with covariation analysis are revealed in
part in these two alternative formats. The majority of the
base pairs are clustered into regular secondary structure
helices, and the majority of the helices are contained withPage 6 of 31

in the boundaries of another helix, forming large cooperative sets of nested helices. The remaining base pairs form
tertiary interactions that either span two sets of nested helices, forming a pseudoknot, or are involved in base triple
interactions.
In the "Matrix of All Possible Helices" plot [http://
www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/CSI/2STR/] , the same RNA sequence is extended along the X- and Y-axes, with all potential helices that are comprised of at least four
consecutive Watson-Crick (G:C and A:U) or G:U base
pairs shown below the diagonal line. The helices in the
present comparative structure model are shown above this
line. The number of potential helices is larger than the actual number present in the biologically-active structure
(see CRW Methods [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/
METHODS/] ). For example, the S. cerevisiae phenylalanine tRNA sequence, with a length of 76 nucleotides,

has 37 possible helices (as defined above); only four of
these are in the crystal structure. The E. coli 16S rRNA, with
1542 nucleotides (nt), has nearly 15,000 possible helices;
only about 60 of these are in the crystal structure. For the
E. coli 23S rRNA (2904 nt), there are more than 50,000
possible helices, with approximately 100 in the crystal
structure. The number of possible secondary structure
models is significantly larger than the number of possible
helices, due to the exponential increase in the number of
different combinations of these helices. The number of
different tRNA secondary structure models is approximately 2.5 × 1019; there are approximately 10393 and
10740 possible structure models for 16S and 23S rRNA, respectively (see CRW Methods
[http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/METHODS/] ). Covariation analysis
accurately predicted the structures of the 16S and 23S rRNAs (see above) from this very large number of structure
models.

1B. Evolution of the 16S and 23S rRNA comparative structure models
An analysis of the evolution of the Noller-Woese-Gutell
comparative structure models for the 16S and 23S rRNAs
is presented here [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/CSI/
EVOLUTION/] (H-1B.1). Our objective is to categorize
the improvements in these covariation-based comparative
structure models by tabulating the presence or absence of
every proposed base pair in each version of the 16S and
23S rRNA structure models, starting with our first 16S [15]
and 23S [19] rRNA models. Every base pair in each of the
structure models was evaluated against the growing
number and diversity of new rRNA sequences. Proposed
base pairs were taken out of the structure model when the
number of sequences without either a covariation or a
G:C, A:U, or G:U base pair was greater than our allowed
minimum threshold; the nucleotide frequencies for those
base pairs are available from the "Lousy Base-Pair" tables
that are discussed in the next section. New base pairs were
proposed when a (new) significant covariation was identified with our newer and more sensitive algorithms that
were applied to larger sequence alignments containing
more inherent variation (see CRW Methods [http://
www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/METHODS/] for more detail).

This analysis produced two very large tables with 579 proposed 16S rRNA base pairs evaluated against six versions
of the structure model and 1001 23S rRNA base pairs evaluated against five versions of the structure model. Some
highlights from these detailed tables are captured in summary tables (Tables 3a and 3b, and [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/CSI/EVOLUTION/] ) that compare the
numbers of sequences and base pairs predicted correctly
and incorrectly for each of the major versions of the 16S
and 23S rRNA structure models. For this analysis, the current structure model is considered to be the correct structure; thus, values for comparisons are referenced to the
numbers of sequences and base pairs in the current structure model (478 base pairs and approximately 7000 sequences for 16S rRNA, and 870 base pairs and
approximately 1050 sequences for 23S rRNA). Three sets
of 16S and 23S rRNA secondary structure diagrams were
developed to reveal the improvements between the current model and earlier versions: 1) changes since the 1996
published structure models; 2) changes since 1983 (16S
rRNA) or 1984 (23S rRNA); and 3) all previously proposed base pairs that are not in the most current structure
models (H-1B.2).

Although other comparative structure models and base
pairs were predicted by other labs, those interactions are
not included in this analysis of the improvements in our
structure models. The four main structure models for 16S
and 23S rRNA are very similar to one another. The Brimacombe [16,20] and Strasburg [17,21] structure models
were determined independently of ours, while the De
Wachter [58,79] models were adapted from our earlier
structure models and have incorporated some of the newer interactions proposed here.

An analysis of these tables reveals several major conclusions from the evolution of the 16S and 23S rRNA covariation-based structure models. First, approximately 60% of
the 16S and nearly 80% of the 23S rRNA base pairs predicted in the initial structure models appear in the current
structure models. The accuracy of these early models, produced from the analysis of only two well-chosen sequences, is remarkable. Second, the accuracy, number of

secondary and tertiary structure interactions, and complexity of the structure models increase as the number and
diversity of sequences increase and the covariation algorithms are improved. As well, some pairs predicted in the
earlier structure models were removed from subsequent
models due to the large number of exceptions to the positional covariation at the two paired positions. Third, the
majority of the tertiary interactions were proposed in the
last few versions of the structure models.
1C. RNA structure definitions
The RNA structure models presented here are composed
of several different basic building blocks (or motifs) that
are described and illustrated at our RNA Structure Definitions page [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/CSI/DEFS/]
(H-1C.1-2). The nucleotides in a comparative structure
model can be either base paired or unpaired. Base paired
nucleotides can be part of either a secondary structure helix (two or more consecutive, antiparallel and nested base
pairs) or a tertiary interaction, which is a more heterogeneous collection of base pair interactions. These include
any non-canonical base pair (not a G:C, A:U, or G:U; e.g.,
U:U), lone or single base pairs (when both positions in a
base pair are not flanked by two nucleotides that are base
paired to one another), base pairs in a pseudoknot arrangement, and base triples (a single nucleotide interacting with a base pair). Each of these base pair categories has
a unique color code in the illustrations on the "RNA Structure Definitions" page, which provides multiple examples
of each category from the 16S and 23S rRNA structure
models. In contrast to the nucleotides that are base paired,
nucleotides can also be unpaired in the comparative structure models. Within this category, they can be within a
hairpin loop (nucleotides capping the end of a helix), in-

2. Nucleotide frequency and conservation information
Underpinning the comparative sequence analysis of RNA
molecules are the realizations that every RNA has evolved
to its present state and form, and that the same secondary
and tertiary structure for an RNA can be derived from
many different sequences that maintain the integrity and
functionality of that structure. These evolutionary and
structural dynamics have made it possible to predict RNA
structure models with comparative analysis (as presented
in the previous section). The tempo and mode of the evolution for every position in the RNA structure is defined by
a complex and not-well-understood equation, with variables for global mutation rates and rates for specific
branches on the phylogenetic tree, the allowed variance
for each nucleotide and the structure with which it is associated, the coordination and dependence between nucleotides, and other constraints not yet defined. In an effort
to begin to understand these dimensionalities associated
with an RNA sequence and to catalogue the observed constraints in each of the RNA molecules maintained within
our CRW Site, we have prepared online tables and figures
that reveal the amount and type of conservation and variation for many of the RNAs available here.

The comparative information for a sequence is initially assembled in a sequence alignment (more information
about alignments below at: "3. Sequence and Structure
Data"). The extent and type of sequence and structure conservation and variation are presented in two general formats: (1) nucleotide frequency tables that contain the
types of nucleotides and their frequencies for each posiPage 9 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

tion in the RNA molecule; and (2) secondary structure diagrams revealing the most conserved nucleotide at each
position that is present in the vast majority of the sequences. The position numbers for the nucleotide frequency tables and conservation diagrams are based upon a
reference sequence (see Table 1). While deletions relative
to the reference sequence are shown in the tables with "-,"
insertions relative to the reference sequence are not
shown. Conservation diagrams summarize the insertions
and deletions relative to the reference sequence.

grouped according to the amino acids that are bound to
the tRNA. Currently, only the type I tRNAs [81] are included here; the tRNAs are collected in 19 functional subgroup
alignments and one total type I alignment. The group I
and II intron alignments are based on the structural classifications determined by Michel (group I [32] and group
II [34]) and Suh (group IE [82]). The group I introns are
split into seven alignments: A, B, Cl-2, C3, D, E, and unknown. The group II introns are divided into the two major subgroups, IIA and IIB (Table 2).

2A. Nucleotide frequency tabular display
The nucleotide frequency tables appear in two general
presentation modes. In the traditional table, the nucleotide types are displayed in the columns, while their frequencies are shown for each alignment in the rows. The
nucleotide frequencies were determined for single positions, base pairs, and base triples for a subset of the RNAs
in the CRW Site collection (detailed in Table 1). Single nucleotide frequencies are available for all individual positions, based upon the reference sequence, for every RNA
in this collection. Base pair frequencies are presented for
a) all base pairs in the current covariation-based structure
models, b) tentative base pairs predicted with covariation
analysis, and c) base pairs previously proposed with comparative analysis that are not included in our current structure models due to a lack of comparative support from the
analysis with our best covariation methods on our current
alignments (named "Lousy" base pairs). Base triples are
interactions between a base pair and a third unpaired nucleotide; base triple frequencies are provided for a) base
triples in the current covariation-based structure models
and b) tentative base triples predicted with covariation
analysis.

For the standard nucleotide frequency tables (Highlight
2A (H-2A)), the left frame in the main frame window
("List Frame") contains the position numbers for the three
types of tables: single bases, base pairs, and base triples.
Clicking on a position, base pair, or base triple number
will bring the detailed nucleotide occurrence and frequency information to the main window ("Data Frame;" H2A.1). The collective scoring data (H-2A.2) used to predict
the base pair is obtained, where available, by clicking the
"Collective Score" link on the right-hand side of the base
pair frequency table.

For each of these frequency tables, the percentages of each
of the nucleotides are determined for multiple alignments, where the most similar sequences are organized
into the same alignment. For the three rRNAs, the alignments are partitioned by their phylogenetic relationships.
There is an alignment for the nuclear-encoded rRNA for
each of the three primary lines of descent ((1) Archaea,
(2) Bacteria, and (3) Eucarya; [80]), each of the two Eucarya organelles (no alignments yet for the 5S rRNA; (4)
Chloroplasts and (5) Mitochondria), and two larger alignments that include all of the (6) nuclear-encoded rRNA sequences for the Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya, and (7)
these three phylogenetic groups and the two Eucarya organelles (Table 2).
For the tRNA and group I and II intron sequences, the
most similar sequences are not necessarily from similar
phylogenetic groups. Instead, the sequences that are most
similar with one another are members of the same functional and/or structural class. The tRNA sequences are

As discussed in Section 1A, we have established a confidence rating for the base pairs predicted with the covariation analysis; a detailed explanation of the covariation
analysis methods and the confidence rating system will be
available in the Methods section of the CRW Site [http://
www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/METHODS/]. The extent of
base pair types and their mutual exchange pattern (e.g.,
A:U <-> G:C) is indicative of the covariation score. This
value increases to the maximum score as the percentage
and the amount of pure covariations (simultaneous
changes at both positions) increase in parallel with a decrease in the number of single uncompensated changes,
and the number of times these coordinated variations occur during the evolution of that RNA (for the rRNAs, the
number of times this covariation occurs in the phylogenetic tree) increases. These scores are proportional to our
confidence in the accuracy of the predicted base pair. Red,
our highest confidence rating, denotes base pairs with the
highest scores and with at least a few phylogenetic events
(changes at both paired positions during the evolution of
that base pair). The colors green, black, and grey denote
base pairs with a G:C, A:U, and/or G:U in at least 80% of
the sequences and within a potential helix that contains at
least one red base pair. Base pairs with a green confidence
rating have a good covariation score although not as high
as (or with the confidence of) a red base pair. Black base
pairs have a lower covariation score, while grey base pairs
are invariant, or nearly so, in 98% of the sequences. Finally, blue base pairs do not satisfy these constraints; nevertheless, we are confident of their authenticity due to a
significant number of covariations within the sequences

in a subset of the phylogenetic tree or are an invariant G:C
or A:U pairings in close proximity to the end of a helix.
The covariation score for each base pair is determined independently for each alignment (e.g., Three Domain/Two
Organelle, Three Domain, Archaea, etc.). The collective
score for each base pair is equivalent to the highest ranking score for any one of the alignments. For example, we
have assigned our highest confidence rating to the
927:1390 base pair in 16S rRNA (Figure 2C; H-2A). Note
that the entry for the 927:1390 base pair (H-2A) in the list
of base pairs in the left frame is red in the C (or confidence) column. For this base pair, only the T (Three Phylogenetic Domains/Two Organelle) alignment has a
significant covariation score (H-2A); thus, only the "T"
alignment name is red. Of the nearly 6000 sequences in
the T alignment, 69% of the sequences have a G:U base
pair, A:U base pair at 16.2%, U:A at 6.9%, and less than
1% of the sequences have a G:C, C:G, U:U, or G:G base
pair (H-2A.1). The collective scoring data (H-2A.2) reveals
that there are 11 phylogenetic events (PE) for the T alignment, while the C1+C3 score is 1.00, greater than the minimum value for this RNA and this alignment (a more
complete explanation of the collective scoring method is
available at CRW Methods [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/METHODS/]). Note that the 928:1389 and
929:1388 base pairs are also both red. Here, six of the seven alignments have significant extents of covariation for
both base pairs and are thus red. Each of the red alignments have at least two base pair types (e.g., G:C and A:U)
that occur frequently, at least three phylogenetic events,
and C1+C3 scores >= 1.5.
2B. Nucleotide frequency mapped onto a phylogenetic tree
The second presentation mode maps the same nucleotide
frequency data in the previous section onto the NCBI phylogenetic tree [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/
taxonomyhome.html/] [60,61] (see Materials and Methods for details). This display allows the user to navigate
through the phylogenetic tree and observe the nucleotide
frequencies for any node and all of the branches off of that
node. The number of nucleotide substitutions on each
branch are displayed, with the number of mutual changes
displayed for the base pairs and base triples. Currently,
only the 16S and 23S rRNA nucleotide frequencies available in the first tabular presentation format are mapped
onto the phylogenetic tree (see Table 1). As shown in
CRW Section 2B (H-2B), the left frame in the main frame
window contains the position numbers for the three types
of data, single bases, base pairs, and base triples. Clicking
on a position, base pair, or base triple number will initially reveal, in the larger section of the main frame, the root
of the phylogenetic tree, with the frequencies for the selected single base, base pair, or base triple. The presentation for single bases (H-2B.1) reveals the nucleotides and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

their frequencies for all sequences at the root level, followed by the nucleotides and their frequencies for the Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota (nuclear, mitochondrial,
and chloroplast). Nucleotides that occur in less than 2%,
1.5%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%, and 0.1% of the sequences can be
eliminated from the screen by changing the green "percentage limit" selection at the top of the main frame. The
number of phylogenetic levels displayed on the screen can
also be modulated with the yellow phylogenetic level button at the top of the main frame. Highlight 2B.1 displays
only one level of the phylogenetic tree from the point of
origin, which is the root level for this example. In contrast,
Highlight 2B.2 displays four levels from the root. The
number of single nucleotide changes on each branch of
the phylogenetic tree is shown at the end of the row. For
single bases, this number is in black. For base pairs, there
are two numbers. The orange color refers to the number of
changes at one of the two positions, while the pink color
refers to the number of mutual changes (or covariations)
that has occurred on that branch of the tree (H-2B.2). For
example, for the 16S rRNA base pair 501:544, there are 65
mutual and 74 single changes in total for the Archaea,
Bacteria, Eucarya nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast.
Within the Archaea, there are six mutual and five single
changes. Five of these mutual changes are within the Euryarchaeota, and four of these are within the Halobacteriales (H-2B.2). The base pair types that result from a
mutual change (or strict covariation) are marked with an
asterisk ("*").
2C. Secondary structure conservation diagrams
Conservation secondary structure diagrams summarize
nucleotide frequency data by revealing the nucleotides
present at the most conserved positions and the positions
that are present in nearly all sequences in the analyzed
data set. The conservation information is overlaid on a
secondary structure diagram from a sequence that is representative of the chosen group (e.g., E. coli for the gamma
subdivision of the Proteobacteria, or S. cerevisiae for the
Fungi; H-2C.1). All positions that are present in less than
95% of the sequences studied are considered variable,
hidden from view, and replaced by arcs. These regions are
labeled to show the minimum and maximum numbers of
nucleotides present in that region in the group under
study (e.g., [0–179] indicates that all sequences in the
group contain a minimum of zero nucleotides but not
more than 179 nucleotides in a particular variable region). The remaining positions, which are present in at
least 95% of the sequences, are separated into four groups
(H-2C.1): 1) those which are conserved in 98–100% of
the sequences in the group (shown with red upper-case
letters indicating the conserved nucleotide); 2) those
which are conserved in 90–98% of the sequences in the
group (shown with red lower-case letters indicating the
conserved nucleotide); 3) those which are conserved in

Page 11 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

80–90% of the sequences in the group (shown with large
closed circles); and 4) those which are conserved in less
than 80% of the sequences in the group (shown with
small open circles).
Insertions relative to the reference sequence are identified
with a blue line to the nucleotides between which the insertion occurs, and text in small blue font denoting the
maximum number of nucleotides that are inserted and
the percentage of the sequences with any length insertion
at that place in the conservation secondary structure diagram (H-2C.1). All insertions greater than five nucleotides
are tabulated, in addition to insertions of one to four nucleotides that occur in more than 10% of the sequences
analyzed for that conservation diagram. Each diagram
contains the full NCBI phylogenetic classification [http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/] for the group.
Currently, there are conservation diagrams for the 5S, 16S,
and 23S rRNA for the broadest phylogenetic groups: (1)
the three major phylogenetic groups and the two Eucarya
organelles, chloroplasts and mitochondria; (2) the three
major phylogenetic groups; (3) the Archaea; (4) the Bacteria; (5) the Eucarya (nuclear encoded); (6) the chloroplasts; and (7) the mitochondria. Longer term, our goal is
to generate rRNA conservation diagrams for all branches
of the phylogenetic tree that contain a significant number
of sequences. Toward this end, we have generated 5S, 16S,
and 23S rRNA conservation diagrams for many of the major phylogenetic groups within the Bacterial lineage (e.g.,
Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). We will also be generating
conservation diagrams for the group I and II introns.
The CRW Site conservation diagram interface (H-2C.2)
provides both the conservation diagrams (in PostScript
and PDF formats) and useful auxiliary information. The
display is sorted phylogenetically, with each row of the table containing all available conservation information for
the rRNA sequences in that phylogenetic group. For each
of the three rRNA molecules (5S, 16S, and 23S), three
items are available: 1) the reference structure diagram,
upon which the conservation information is overlaid; 2)
the conservation diagram itself; and 3) the number of sequences summarized in the conservation diagram, which
links to a web-formatted list of those sequences. The lists,
for each sequence, contain: 1) organism name (NCBI scientific name); 2) GenBank accession number; 3) cell location; 4) RNA Type; 5) RNA Class; and 6) NCBI phylogeny.
Users who want more information about a given sequence should consult the CRW RDBMS (see below). An
equivalent presentation for intron conservation data is
under development.

3. Sequence and structure data
Structure-based alignments and phylogenetic analysis of RNA structure
Analysis of the patterns of sequence conservation and variation present in RNA sequence alignments can reveal
phylogenetic relationships and be utilized to predict RNA
structure. The accuracy of the phylogenetic tree and the
predicted RNA structure is directly dependent on the
proper juxtapositioning of the sequences in the alignment. These alignments are an attempt to approximate
the best juxtapositioning of sequences that represent similar placement of nucleotides in their three-dimensional
structure. For sequences that are very similar, the proper
juxtapositioning or alignment of sequences can be
achieved simply by aligning the obviously similar or identical subsequences with one another. However, when
there is a significant amount of variation between the sequences, it is not possible to align sequences accurately or
with confidence based on sequence information alone.
For these situations, we can juxtapose those sequences
that form the same secondary and tertiary structure by
aligning the positions that form the same components of
the similar structure elements (e.g., align the positions
that form the base of the helix, the hairpin loop, etc.). Given the accurate prediction of the 16S and 23S rRNA secondary structures from the analysis of the alignments we
assembled, we are now even more confident in the accuracy of the positioning of the sequence positions in our
alignments, and the process we utilize to build them.
Aligning new sequences
At this stage in our development of the sequence alignments, there are well-established and distinct patterns of
sequence conservation and variation. From the base of the
phylogenetic tree, we observe regions that are conserved
in all of the rRNA sequences that span the three phylogenetic domains and the two eucaryotic organelles, the chloroplast and mitochondria. Other regions of the rRNA are
conserved within the three phylogenetic domains although variable in the mitochondria. As we proceed into
the phylogenetic tree, we observe positions that are conserved within one phylogenetic group and different at the
same level in the other phylogenetic groups. For example,
Bacterial rRNAs have positions that are conserved within
all members of their group, but different from the Archaea
and the Eucarya (nuclear-encoded). These types of patterns of conservation and variation transcend all levels of
the phylogenetic tree and result in features in the rRNA sequences and structures that are characteristic for each of
the phylogenetic groups at each level of the phylogenetic
tree (e.g., level one: Bacterial, Archaea, Eucarya; level two:
Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota in the Archaea; level three:
gamma, alpha, beta, and delta/epsilon subdivisions in the
Proteobacteria). Carl Woese likened the different rates of
evolution at the positions in the rRNA to the hands on a

clock [4]. The highly variable regions are associated with
the second hand; these can change many times for each
single change that occurs in the regions associated with
the minute hand. Accordingly, the minute hand regions
change many times for each single change in the hour
hand regions of the rRNAs. In addition to the different
rates of evolution, many of the positions in the rRNA are
dependent on one another. The simplest of the dependencies, positional covariation, is the basis for the prediction
of the same RNA structure from similar RNA sequences
(see Section 1A, Covariation Analysis).
We utilize these underlying dynamics in the evolution
and positional dependency of the RNA to facilitate the
alignment and structural analysis of the RNA sequences.
Our current RNA data sets contain a very large and diverse
set of sequences that represent all sections of the major
phylogenetic branches on the tree of life. This data collection also contains many structural variations, in addition
to their conserved sequence and structure core. The majority of the new RNA sequences are very similar to at least
one sequence that has already been aligned for maximum
sequence and structure similarity; thus, these sequences
are relatively simple to align. However, some of the new
sequences contain subsequences that cannot be aligned
with any of the previously aligned sequences, due to the
excessive variation in these hypervariable regions. For
these sequences, the majority of the sequence can be readily aligned with the more conserved elements, followed by
a manual, visual analysis of the hypervariable regions. To
align these hypervariable regions with more confidence,
we usually need several more sequences with significant
similarity in these regions that will allow us to identify positional covariation and subsequently to predict a new
structural element. Thus, at this stage in the development
of the alignments, the most conserved regions (i.e., hour
hand regions) and semi-conserved regions (i.e., minute

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

hand regions) have been aligned with high confidence.
The second and sub-second (i.e., tenth and hundredth of
a second) hand regions have been aligned for many of the
sequences on the branches at the ends on the phylogenetic tree. However, regions of the sequences continue to
challenge us. For example, the 545 and 1707 regions (E.
coli numbering) contain an excessive amount of variation
in the Eucarya nuclear-encoded 23S-like rRNAs. These two
regions could not be well aligned and we could not predict a common structure with comparative analysis with
ten Eucaryotic sequences in 1988 (see Figures 35–43 in
[48]). However, once a larger number of related Eucaryotic 23S-like rRNA sequences was determined, we reanalyzed these two regions and were able to align those
regions to other related organisms (e.g., S. cerevisiae with
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis carinii, Candida albicans, and Mucor racemosus)
and predict a secondary structure that is common for all
of these rRNAs (see Figures 3 and 6 in [52]). While the secondary structures for the fungal 23S-like rRNAs are determined in these regions, the animal rRNAs were only
partially solved. We still need to determine a common secondary structure for the large variable-sized insertions in
the animal rRNAs, and this will require even more animal
23S-like rRNA sequences from organisms that are very
closely related to the organisms for which we currently
have sequences.
A large sampling of secondary structure diagrams
We have generated secondary structure diagrams for sequences that represent the major phylogenetic groups,
and for those sequences that reveal the major forms of sequence and structure conservation and variation. New secondary structure diagrams are templated from an existing
secondary structure diagram and the alignment of these
two sequences, the sequence for the new structure diagram and the sequence for the structure that has been templated. The nucleotides in the new sequence replace the
templated sequence when they are in the same position in
the alignment, while positions in the new sequence that
are not juxtaposed with a nucleotide in the templated sequence are initially left unstructured. These nucleotides
are then placed interactively into their correct location in
the structure diagram with the program XRNA (Weiser &
Noller, University of California, Santa Cruz) and basepaired when there is comparative support for that pairing
in the alignment; otherwise, they are left unpaired.

The process of generating these secondary structure diagrams occurs in parallel with the development of the sequence alignments. In some cases, the generation of a
structure diagram helps us identify problems with the sequence or its alignment. For example, anomalies in structural elements (in the new structure diagram) that had
strong comparative support in the other sequences could

Page 13 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

be the result of a bad sequence or due to the misalignment
of sequences in the helix region. In other cases, the new
structure diagram reveals a possible helix in a variable region that was weakly predicted with comparative analysis.
However, a re-inspection of a few related structure diagrams revealed another potential helix in this region that
was then substantiated from an analysis of the corresponding region of the alignment. Thus, the process of
generating additional secondary structure diagrams improves the sequence alignments and the predicted structures, in addition to the original purpose for these
diagrams, to reveal the breadth of sequence conservation
and variation for any one RNA type.
Our goals for the "Sequence and Structure Data" section
of the CRW Site are to:
A) Align all rRNA, group I and II intron sequences that are
greater than 90% complete and are available at GenBank;
B) Generate rRNA and group I/II intron secondary structure diagrams for organisms that are representative of a
phylogenetic group or representative of a type of RNA
structural element. The generation of 5S, 16S, and 23S
rRNAs secondary structures from genomic sequences generally has higher priority over other rRNA sequences.
C) Enter pertinent information for each sequence and
structure into our relational database management system. This computer system organizes all of our RNA sequence and structure entries, associates them with the
organisms' complete NCBI phylogeny [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/] , and
allows for the efficient retrieval of this data (see Section 4:
Data Access Systems for more details).
Due in part to the technological improvements in the determination of nucleic acid sequence information, the
number of ribosomal RNA and group I and II intron sequences has increased significantly within the past 10
years. As of December 2001, the approximate numbers of
complete or nearly complete sequences and secondary
structure diagrams for each of these RNAs for the major
phylogenetic groups and structural categories are shown
in Highlight 3A.1. At this time, the actual number of sequences that are both greater than 90% complete and
available at GenBank is greater than the number in our
CRW RDBMS.
The sequences, alignments, and secondary structure diagrams are available from several different web pages,
which are described below in Sections 3A-3D and 4A-4B.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

3A. Index of available sequences and structures
The top section of the "Index of Available Sequences and
Structures" page (H-3A.1) reveals the numbers of available sequences for the Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast groups that are at
least 90% complete and structure diagrams for the 5S,
16S, and 23S rRNAs and group I and group II introns. The
remainder of the index page contains the numbers of sequences and structures for more expanded lists for each of
those five phylogenetic/cell location groups. For example,
the Archaea are expanded to the Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Korarchaeota, and unclassified Archaea. These
counts are updated dynamically when the information in
our relational database management system is revised.
The numbers of sequences and structures are links that
open the RDBMS "standard" output view (see below for
details) for the selected target set. Secondary structure diagrams are available in PostScript, PDF, and BPSEQ (see
above) formats from the structure links. The organism
names in the output from these links are sorted alphabetically. The number of entries per output page is selectable
(20, 50, 100, 200, or 400), with 20 set as a default. Entries
not shown on the first page can be viewed by clicking on
the "Next" button at the bottom left of the output page.

As of December 2001, our data collection contains 11,464
rRNA (5S, 16S, and 23S) and intron (group I, II, and other) sequences. The ribosomal RNAs comprise 80% of this
total, and 16S rRNA represents 82% of the rRNA total; the
remainder is split between the 23S and 5S rRNAs. Intron
sequences comprise 20% of our total collection, with approximately twice as many group I introns than group II
introns. Of the 406 secondary structure diagrams, the majority are for the 16S (71%) and 23S (20%) rRNAs. At this
time, tRNA records are not maintained in our database
system.
3B. New secondary structure diagrams
Secondary structure diagrams that have been created or
modified recently are listed and available from their own
page (H-3B.1). These diagrams are sorted into one of three
categories: new or modified 1) in the past seven days
(highlighted with red text); 2) in the past month (blue
text); and 3) in the past three months (black text). Diagrams are listed alphabetically by organism name within
each of the three time categories. The display also indicates the cell location and RNA Class (see below) for each
diagram. The PostScript, PDF, and BPSEQ files can be
viewed by clicking the appropriate radio button at the top
of this page and then the links in the structure field.
3C. Secondary structure diagram retrieval
Multiple secondary structure diagrams can be downloaded from the Secondary Structure Retrieval Page (Highlight
3C.1). This system allows the user to select from organism

by subdividing large queries.)

3D. Sequence alignment retrieval
The Sequence Alignment Retrieval page (Highlight 3D.1)
provides access to the sequence alignments used in the
analyses presented at the CRW Site. Sequence alignments
are available in GenBank and AE2 (Macke) formats (Table
2). These alignments will be updated periodically when
the number of new sequences is significant. Newer alignments might also contain refinements in the alignments
of the sequences. For each alignment, there is a corresponding list of sequences, their phylogenetic placement,
and other information about the sequences (see conservation list of sequences for conservation diagrams). At
present, only the rRNA alignments are available; the
group I and group II intron alignments will be made available in June 2002.

3E. rRNA Introns
The introns that occur in 16S and 23S rRNAs are organized into four preconfigured online tables. These tables
disseminate the intron information and emphasize the
major dimensions inherent in this data: 1) intron position
in the rRNA, 2) intron type, 3) phylogenetic distribution,
and 4) number of introns per exon gene.
3E. rRNA Introns Table 1: Intron Position
The introns in rRNA Introns Table 1 are organized by their
position numbers in the 16S and 23S rRNAs. The 16S and
23S rRNA position numbers are based on the E. coli rRNA
reference sequence (J01695) (see Table 1). The intron occurs between the position number listed and the following position (e.g., the introns between position 516 and
517 are listed as 516). rRNA Introns Table 1 has four components.

The total number of introns and the number of positions
with at least one intron in 16S and 23S rRNA are shown
in rRNA Introns Table 1A (see highlights below and H3E.1). The list of all publicly available rRNA introns, sorted by the numeric order of the intron positions, is contained in rRNA Introns Table 1B. This table has nine
fields: 1) rRNA type (16S or 23S); 2) the intron position;
3) the number of documented introns occurring at that
position; 4) the intron types (RNA classes) for each rRNA
intron position; 5) the number of introns for each intron
type for each rRNA position; 6) the length variation (minimum # – maximum #) for introns in each intron type; 7)
the cell location for each intron type; 8) the number of
phylogenetic groups for each intron type, (here, defined
using the third column from rRNA Introns Table 3: Phylogenetic Distribution); and 9) the organism name and accession number.
These fields in rRNA Introns Table 1B (H-3E.1) allow for
a natural dissemination of the introns that occur at each
rRNA site. For example, of the 116 introns (as of December 2001) at position 516 in 16S rRNA, 55 of them are in
the IC1 subgroup (H-3E.2); these introns range from
334–1789 nucleotides in length, all occur in the nucleus,
and are distributed into four distinct phylogenetic groups.
54 of the introns at position 516 are in the IE subgroup,
range from 190–622 nucleotides in length, all occur in the
nucleus, and are also distributed into four distinct phylogenetic groups, etc.
Additional information is available in a new window for
each of the values in rRNA Introns
1B (H-3E.3). This
information is retrieved from the relational database
management system (see section 4). The information for
each intron entry in the new window are: 1) exon (16S or
23S rRNA); 2) intron position in the rRNA; 3) intron type
(RNA class); 4) length of intron (in nucleotides); 5) cell

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

location; 6) NCBI phylogeny; 7) organism name; 8) accession number; 9) link to structure diagram (if it is available); and 10) comment.
The number of intron types per intron position are tabulated in rRNA Introns Table 1C (H-3E.4), while the
number of introns at each rRNA position are ranked in
rRNA Introns Table 1D (H-3E.5). This latter table contains
six fields of information for each rRNA: 1) number of introns per rRNA position; 2) number of positions with that
number of introns; 3) the rRNA position numbers; 4) total number of introns (field #1 × field #2); 5) the Poisson
probability (see rRNA Introns Table 1D for details); and
6) the expected number of introns for each of the observed number of introns per rRNA site.
The highlights from rRNA Introns Table 1 are: 1) As of December 2001, there are 1184 publicly available introns
that occur in the rRNAs, with 900 in the 16S rRNA, and
284 in 23S rRNA. These introns are distributed over 152
different positions, 84 in the 16S rRNA and 68 in 23S rRNA. 2) Although 16S rRNA is approximately half the
length of 23S rRNA, there are more than three times as
many introns in 16S rRNA. However, this bias is due, at
least in part, to the more prevalent sampling of 16S and
16S-like rRNAs for introns. 3) The sampling of introns at
the intron positions is not evenly distributed (1184/152 =
7.79 introns per position for a random sampling). Instead, nearly 50% (71/152) of the intron positions contain a single intron and 89% (135/152) of the intron
positions contain ten or less introns. In contrast, 59%
(681/1163) of the introns are located at 9% of the intron
positions and the three intron positions with the most introns (943, 516, and 1516 in 16S rRNA) contain 361, or
31% (361/1163), of the rRNA introns. 4) rRNA Introns
Table 1D compares the observed distribution of rRNA introns with the Poisson distribution for the observed
number of introns. The Poisson distribution, P(x) = e-µ
µxx!-1, where µ is the mean frequency of introns for positions in a particular exon and x is the target number of introns present at a particular position, allows the
calculation of expected numbers of positions containing a
particular number of introns. Based upon the observed
raw numbers of introns in the 16S and 23S rRNAs, we expect to see no positions in 16S rRNA containing more
than five introns and no positions in 23S rRNA containing
more than three introns. However, thirty-five rRNA positions fall into one of those two categories. We also see
both more positions without introns and fewer positions
containing only one or two introns than expected. This
observed distribution of rRNA introns among the available insertion positions is extremely unlikely to occur by
chance. 5) While a single intron type occurs at the majority of the intron positions, several positions have more
than one intron type. A few of the positions that deserve

special attention have IC1 and IE introns at the same position (16S rRNA positions 516 and 1199, and 23S rRNA
position 2563). The 16S rRNA position 788 has several examples each of IC1, IIB, and I introns.
3E. rRNA Introns Table 2: Intron Type
The introns are organized by intron type, as defined
above, in rRNA Introns Table 2 (H-3E.6). The frequency of
16S and 23S rRNA exons, non-rRNA exons, number of intron positions in the 16S and 23S rRNA, cell locations,
and number of phylogenetic groups for each intron type
are tabulated. The highlights of this table are: 1) Of the
1184 known rRNA introns, 980 (83%) are group I, 21
(2%) are group II introns, and the remaining 183 (15%)
are unclassified (see below). While only 2% of the rRNA
introns are group II, 62% (728/1180) of the non-rRNA introns are group II. In addition to the group II introns,
nearly all of the IC3 introns do not occur in rRNAs. 2) The
majority of the rRNA group I introns (851/980 = 87%) fall
into one of three subgroups: I (276 introns), IC1 (415 introns), and IE (160 introns). 3) As noted earlier, there are
three times as many 16S rRNA group I introns than 23S
rRNA group I introns (753 vs. 227). 4) Among the three
cellular organelles in eucaryotes, 1010 introns (85%) occur in the nucleus, 133 (11%) in the mitochondria, and
41 (4%) in the chloroplasts. 5) The subgroups IC1, IC3
and IE are only present in the nucleus, while the IA, IB,
IC2, ID, and II subgroups occur almost exclusively in
chloroplasts and/or mitochondria.

The 183 introns described in rRNA Introns Table 2 as "Unclassified" merit special attention. All of these introns do
not fall into either the group I and group II categories;
however, two notable groups of introns are included within the "Unclassified" category. The first is a series of 43 introns occurring in Archaeal rRNAs (the Archaeal introns).
Thirty-one of the known Archaeal introns are found in
16S rRNA and the remaining twelve are from 23S rRNA
exons. The Archaeal introns range in length from 24 to
764 nucleotides, with an average length of 327 nucleotides. The second group contains 121 spliceosomal introns found in fungal rRNAs. 92 spliceosomal introns are
from 16S rRNA and 29 are from 23S rRNA; the lengths of
these introns range from 49 to 292 nucleotides. A future
version of this database will include both of these groups
as separate, distinct entries. Both the Archaeal and splicesomal introns occur only in nuclear rRNA genes and tend
to occur at unique sites; the lone exception is the spliceosomal intron from Dibaeis baeomyces nuclear 23S rRNA
position 787, a position where a group IIB intron occurs
in mitochondrial Marchantia polymorpha rRNA. The Unclassified group contains 21 introns that do not fall into
any of the four previously discussed categories (group I,
group II, Archaeal, or spliceosomal), including all four
mitochondrial introns in this group.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

rRNA Introns Table 2 expands the presentation by providing links to twenty additional tables (H-3E.7), each of
which provides expanded information about a specific intron type. The organism name, exon, intron position, cell
location, and complete phylogeny are accessible for each
intron from these tables. These online tables are dynamically updated daily as information about new introns is
made available.
3E. rRNA Introns Table 3: Phylogenetic Distribution
The distribution of introns on the phylogenetic tree is tabulated in rRNA Introns Table 3A (H-3E.8) and 3B (H3E.9). rRNA Introns Table 3A reveals the ratio of the
number of rRNA introns per rRNA gene for the nuclear,
chloroplast, and mitochondrial encoded RNAs for the
major phylogenetic groups. The most noteworthy distributions are: 1) The majority (96%) of the rRNA introns
occur in Eucarya, followed by the Archaea, and the Bacteria. 2) Only one rRNA intron has been documented in the
Bacteria; due to the large number of rRNA gene sequences
that have been determined, the ratio of rRNA introns per
rRNA gene is essentially zero for the bacteria. 3) The frequency of introns in Archaea rRNAs is higher, with 43 examples documented as of December 2001. Within the
Archaea, there is a higher ratio of rRNA introns in the Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales subbranches in the
Crenarchaeota branch. 4) For the three primary phylogenetic groups, the highest ratio of rRNA introns per rRNA
gene is for the Eucarya, and for the phylogenetic groups
within the Eucarya that have significant numbers of rRNA
sequences, the ratio is highest in the fungi. Here, the ratios
of rRNA introns per rRNA gene are similar between the
nucleus and mitochondria (1.34 for the nucleus, 1.20 for
the mitochondria). A significant number of rRNA introns
occurs in the plants, with similar ratios of rRNA intron/
rRNA gene for the nucleus, chloroplast, and mitochondria
(0.36 for the nucleus, 0.38 for the chloroplast, and 0.34
for the mitochondria). In sharp contrast with the fungi
and plants, only one intron has been documented in an
animal rRNA, occurring within the Calliphora vicina nuclear-encoded 23S-like rRNA (GenBank accession number
K02309).

Each of the two special "Unclassified" rRNA intron groups
has a specific phylogenetic bias. Archaeal rRNA introns,
which have unique sequence and structural characteristics
[83], have not yet been observed within the Euryarchaeota
or Korarchaeota; in fact, no non-Archaeal introns have
been found in Archaea rRNAs to date. Splicesomal rRNA
introns have only been reported in 31 different genera in
the Ascomycota [84]. rRNA Introns Table 3A also presents
the numbers of (complete or nearly so) rRNA sequences
in the same phylogenetic groups in order to address the
question of sampling bias. Two important caveats to this
data must be considered. First, the numbers of rRNA se-

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

quences are an underestimate, since many rRNA introns
are published with only short flanking exon sequences
and do not meet the 90% completeness criterion for inclusion in this rRNA sequence count. The second caveat is
that many rRNA sequences contain multiple introns (see
rRNA Introns Table 4 and related discussion, below, for
more information). Of the 51 phylogenetic group/cell location combinations shown in rRNA Introns Table 3 that
may contain rRNA introns, 15 (29%) have a intron:rRNA
sequence ratio greater than 1.0, indicating a bias toward
introns within those groups. Introns are comparatively
rare within the 26 (51%) groups that have a ratio below
0.3; ten of these 26 groups contain no known rRNA introns. Ten (20%) of the groups have intermediate ratios
(between 0.3 and 1.0).
A more detailed phylogenetic distribution is available in
rRNA Introns Table 3B (H-3E.10). The first three fields
contain levels 2, 3, and 4 of the NCBI phylogeny, followed
by fields for the genus of the organism, cell location, exon
(16S or 23S rRNA), and intron type. Each of these classifications include a link to the complete details (organism
name, phylogeny, cell location, exon, intron position, intron number, accession number, and structure diagram
(when available)) for the intron sequences in that group.
3E. rRNA Introns Table 4: Number of Introns per Exon
rRNA Introns Table 4 presents the number of introns per
rRNA gene (H-3E.11). While more than 80% of the documented rRNA genes do not have an intron, 646 16S and
182 23S rRNAs have at least one intron. Approximately
75% (623) of these genes have a single intron, 15% (127)
have two introns, 0.5% (40) have three, 0.25% (20) have
four, 0.1% (11) have five, two rRNA genes have 6, 7 or 8
introns, and one rRNA gene has 9 introns.

To determine the amount of bias in the distribution of introns among their exon sequences, the Poisson distribution (here, µ is the mean frequency of introns for a
particular exon and x is the target number of introns per
rRNA gene) has been used to calculate the number of
rRNA sequences expected to contain a given number of introns (rRNA Introns Table 4). Based upon this data, no
rRNA sequences are expected to contain four or more introns; in fact, we see 38 sequences that contain these large
numbers of introns. The observed numbers of sequences
exceed the expected values for all but one category: fewer
rRNAs contain only one intron than expected.
The two molecules (16S and 23S rRNA) show a differing
trend with respect to cell location for those sequences containing large numbers of introns. In 16S rRNA, only nuclear genes (ten) have been observed to contain five or more
introns; indeed, of the 57 genes containing three or more
introns, only two are not nuclear (both of these are mito-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

chondrial). In 23S rRNA, the trend is both opposite and
weaker; of the thirteen rRNA sequences containing four or
more introns, five are nuclear (containing five introns),
with four chloroplast and four mitochondrial genes comprising the remaining eight sequences.
rRNA Introns Table 4 provides access to seventeen additional tables (H-3E.12), which each present the complete
information for every intron within a particular class (e.g.,
16S rRNA genes containing two introns), grouped by their
exons. As with the other online tables, this information
will be updated daily to reflect new intron sequences that
are added to this database.
The final components of the "rRNA Introns" page are 16S
and 23S rRNA secondary structure diagrams that show the
locations for all of the known rRNA introns (H-3E.13).
The information collected here on the "rRNA Introns"
page is the basis for two detailed analyses that will be published elsewhere: 1) the spatial distribution of introns on
the three dimensional structure of the 16S and 23S rRNA
(Jackson et al., manuscript in preparation); and 2) the statistical analysis of the distribution of introns on the rRNA
(Bhattacharya et al., manuscript in preparation).
3F. Group 1/11 Intron distributions
For the CRW Site project, we collect group I and II introns
and all other introns that occur in the ribosomal RNA. The
"Intron Distribution Data" page contains three tables that
compare intron types, phylogeny, exon, and cell location.

Intron Distribution Table 1 maps "Intron Type" vs. "Phylogeny" (and "Cell Location;" H-3F.1). Group I and II intron data are highlighted with yellow and blue
backgrounds, respectively. The phylogenetic divisions are
also split into the three possible cellular locations (nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondria). A few of the highlights are:
1) the Eukaryota contain the majority (2218 / 2349 =
94%) of the introns in the CRW RDBMS. 2) The Archaea
have 42 introns that have unique characteristics and are
called "Archaeal introns." 3) Group I introns are present
in eukaryotes (nuclear-, chloroplast-, and mitochondrialencoded genes) and in Bacteria. Group II introns have
only been observed in Bacteria and in Eukaryotic chloroplast and mitochondrial genes.
Intron Distribution Table 2 shows "Intron Type" vs. "Exon" (and "Cell Location;" H-3F.2). Again, group I and II
intron data are highlighted with yellow and blue backgrounds, respectively. In this table, the exon types are split
into the three possible cellular locations (nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondria). As of December 2001, the most
obvious trend is that the exons with the most Group I in-

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

trons are 16S rRNA (900), leucine tRNA (337), 23S rRNA
(284), ribosomal protein S16 (214), and ribosomal protein L16 (152).
Intron Distribution Table 3 compartmentalizes the intron
data by "Phylogeny" and "Exon" (and "Cell Location;" H3F.3). In this table, color is used to highlight the three
phylogenetic domains (Archaea in yellow, Bacteria in
blue, and Eukaryota in green). As in Intron Distribution
Table 2, the exon types are split into the three possible cellular locations (nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondria).
Each of these three tables is dynamically created from a
specific series of RDBMS queries on a daily basis. As of December 2001, links connecting to the specific RDBMS results are not available.
4. Data access systems
For our first generation of online comparative RNA structure databases (16S rRNA [46,47], 23S rRNA [48–52], and
group I Intron [33]), we organized the rRNA and group I
intron secondary structures into a simple static set of manually-generated HTML pages. The structure diagrams were
organized first by RNA type (for the rRNAs; e.g., all 16S
rRNA diagrams were grouped together) or structural subtype (for group I introns; e.g., IC1) and then by the phylogenetic order of the organisms. This type of presentation
is acceptable, although not ideal, for a small number of
entries. However, it is grossly inadequate and inefficient
for larger numbers of entries and more fields of information. Thus, with the anticipation that our database of comparative RNA information would grow significantly, the
need to associate more fields of information with each entry, to automatically and dynamically generate the HTML
output for all queries of the database, and the ability to
search our database for entries with specific attributes in
many fields and to sort those fields in the output with different priorities, we have developed a relational database
management system (RDBMS) that is built on the MySQL
database program (see Materials and Methods).

Our goal was to create a system that would allow for the
following examples of dynamic searches of our CRW RDBMS. Find and output:
A. Homo sapiens 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA entries.
B. Enteric bacterial rRNA sequences and/or secondary
structure diagrams.
C. 1) Tunicate and 2) Coelacanth rRNA sequences.
D. All 23S rRNA sequences. Sort output by four methods:
1) organism name, alphabetically; 2) phylogenetic classi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

fication; 3) sequence length; and 4) first by cellular location, then by phylogenetic classification.
E. Group I introns that occur: 1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 2) in mitochondria, 3) in the exons 16S and 23S rRNA, 4) at position 516 in 16S rRNA, 5) in the IE subgroup,
6) in the IE subgroup at 16S rRNA position 516.
Each sequence and structure entry has the following fields
or attributes: organism name, NCBI phylogeny, common
name, cell location, RNA type, RNA class, sequence
length, accession number, intron number, intron position, exon, open reading frame, link to secondary structure diagram (if it exists), and comment. An abbreviated
explanation for each of these attributes is given in Table 4;
a full explanation is available online at the RDBMS page.
The RDBMS and the data that it contains are accessed by
several different graphical interfaces. One interface, the
"Index of Available RNA Sequences and Structures," was
described in Section 3, "Sequence and Structure Data."
The SQL queries on this page were predetermined and restricted. The "Index" contains the number of sequences
and structures for different molecules and phylogenetic
groups. Clicking a link searches the current database for
all entries that satisfy that specific query (e.g., bacterial
16S rRNA structures) and dynamically generates the output. The SQL queries for Sections 3E (rRNA Introns) and
3F (Group I/II Intron Distribution) are also preset. In contrast with the predetermined and restricted searches available on these pages, we have also developed two different
graphical interactive interfaces for Section 4, "Data Access
Systems," that allow the user to define and implement
their own search of the same information in our relational
database management system. The first one, called
"Standard," is the least restrictive and allows the user to
search for any values present in one or a combination of
the attributes and to sort the output on any combination
of attributes (see Section 4A below). The second one is
semi-restrictive and allows the user to navigate through
the phylogenetic tree to search for those entries that are
within specific phylogenetic groups (see Section 4B below).
4A. RDBMS (Standard)
The "Standard" interface is the most fundamental of our
interfaces to the CRW RDBMS information. While the restricted, specialized interface to the RDBMS information
in Section 3A requires minimal instruction to use, the
standard interface, with its ability to cull out all arrangements of information from the different fields with sophisticated search queries and output field sortings,
requires a quick lesson for its operation. The selection
process has three stages: 1) selection of attribute fields to

Page 19 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

display; 2) determination of values for the search; and 3)
adjustment of the output field sort order.
A detailed explanation for each of the attributes is available from the links to the attribute names. This information is shown in the right frame. Additional examples of
this system are available online.
Step 1. At the onset, the user selects the fields to be displayed on the screen and then clicks the "Go" button.
While the user can select the individual fields (e.g., "Organism" or "Phylogeny"), for most applications the "QrRNA" (query rRNA), "Qintron" (query intron), or "All"
options will automatically click the appropriate fields that
are most important for searching for ribosomal RNA or
group I and II intron entries.
Step 2. Select values for the fields or attributes. The acceptable values for the attributes in our RDBMS system are
shown on the main frame of the query page (for list- and
button-driven fields) or, for text input fields, can be determined with the "V" (values) button on the right side of
the main frame; the results are displayed in the right frame
(see Figure 3 and H-4A.1).
• The values for cellular location are Chl (chloroplast),
Cya (cyanelle), Mit (mitochondria), Nuc (nuclear), and
Vir (viral); each can be selected by simply checking the
box to the left of its name.
• The values for the attributes RNA Type, ORF (open reading frame), Secondary Structures (entries with/without
secondary structure diagrams), Results/Page, and Color
Display are also displayed on the main frame, and can be
selected by clicking the appropriate box or button.
The values for other attributes such as RNA Class, Sequence Length, and Exon can be determined by selecting
one or more of the values in the scroll box. The values for
these attributes can also be found by clicking the "V" button associated with each attribute. For example, clicking
on the "Exon" "V" button will reveal, in the right frame,
all of the exons that are contained in our database. The
same exons are present in the scroll box.
• The values displayed for any one attribute are dependent
on the settings of the other attributes. For example, when
only rRNA is selected for the "RNA Type," then there are
no values for "Exon." All of the possible exon values are
displayed when "Intron" is the selected "RNA Type,"
while only a subset of the possible exon values are shown
when Mit (mitochondria) is the selected "Cell Location."
Note: no selection for an attribute signifies to this system
that all of the values are possible.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

The values present in our database for the attributes "Organism," "Phylogeny" (except for the first level – Archaea,
Bacteria, and Eukaryota – that can be selected from the
main frame), "Common Name" (except for the first level:
"Animals," "Fungi&Plants," "Protists"), "Accession
Number," "Intron Position," and "Comment" can only be
observed in the right frame after clicking the "V" button.
• The values selected with the mouse in the right frame
will appear in the appropriate attribute field.
• The values for each attribute are dependent on the settings for the other attributes. For example, if there are
many values for the "Organism" field, selecting Archaea in
the "Phylogeny" field will reduce the number of names in
the "Organism" field to just those that are in this phylogenetic group.
• The number of possible values for an attribute can also
be constrained by entering only part of a value in the field.
For example, typing 'Esch' in the "Organism" field will
output several organism names that contain 'Escherichia'
when the "V" button is clicked. Typing "coli" in this field
will list all organism names that contain "coli," as either
part of a name or a complete word.
• Note that the system is case sensitive for all fields except
"Common Name." The text 'esch' in the same "Organism"
field will not output 'Escherichia' in the right frame.
The "Phylogeny" field with the values frame on the right
was developed to allow the user to navigate through the
phylogenetic tree. The information for the "Phylogeny"
and "Common Name" fields is downloaded from the
NCBI (see Materials and Methods; this information is
downloaded daily to assure that we have the most current
version of this data). There are two general modes of operation.
For mode one, you can systematically navigate through
the phylogenetic tree to the selected goal point. For example, to get to the last phylogenetic group that contains
Homo sapiens and gorillas, the user would click on the "Eukaryota" phylogeny button, then click on the "Fungi/
Metazoa group" link in the right frame, followed by the
"Metazoa," "Eumetazoa," "Bilateria," "Coelomata," "Deuterostomia," "Chordata," "Craniata," "Vertebrata," "Gnathostomata,"
"Teleostomi,"
"Euteleostomi,"
"Sarcopterygii," "Tetrapoda," "Amniota," "Mammalia,"
"Theria," "Eutheria," "Primates," "Catarrhini," and "Hominidae" links. The phylogenetic group Hominidae contains the genera Gorilla, Pan (chimpanzees), Pongo, and
Homo (see Figure 3, H-4A.1, and H-4A.2). This type of
navigation is useful when you know the links that will get
you to the desired goal point; otherwise, mode two can

Page 20 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

help you jump to the appropriate node in the phylogenetic tree.
For the second mode, you type all or part of the name of
an organism or phylogenetic group that is close to the
phylogenetic node you want. For example, type "Homo
sapiens" in the "Phylogeny" field and press the "V" button
in the "Phylogeny" field. The right frame will display a few
names; from these, select "Homo sapiens." The right
frame now contains the entire phylogenetic path from the
base of the tree to Humans (Figure 3 and H-4A.1).
The "Common Name" attribute can also help identify organism names in the CRW RDBMS. As with the phylogeny
operation, two general modes for determining the values
are available. For the first, the user would type the presumed common name in the "Common Name" field, and
click the "V" button. A few general examples are: worm,
fish, cat, dog, and human. More specific examples are:
common earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris), European polecat (Mustela putorius), and duckbill platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). These names must be in the "Common
Name" database for the sequence entry to be identified
with this method. In contrast, the second mode is intended to identify larger groups of organisms. The three buttons in the "Common Name" field ("Animals,"
"Fungi&Plants," "Protists;" H-4A.3) each reveal various
low-level common names in the right frame that are arranged in a pseudo-phylogenetic structure. For example, a
few of the lower animals (sponges, flatworms, etc.) are
listed when the "Animals" button is pressed, in addition
to the Protostomia, Deuterostomia, and organisms nested
within these groups (Arthropoda, chordates, vertebrates,
Mammals, etc.; H-4A.3). Accordingly, the "Fungi&Plants"
and "Protists" buttons reveal the major groups of organisms within their respective groups. For the latter mode of
operation, the user selects one of these common names,
such as "Mammals." The phylogeny for this group then
appears in the same right frame (cellular organisms, Eukaryota, Fungi/Metazoa group, Metazoa, Eumetazoa, Bilateria, Coelomata, Deuterostomia, Chordata, Craniata,
Vertebrata, Gnathostomata, Teleostomi, Euteleostomi,
Sarcopterygii, Tetrapoda, Amniota, Mammalia), along
with the two phylogenetic groups within the Mammals
(Mammalia), Prototheria and Theria. Another example is
the common name "Mosses" in the Fungi&Plants. Selecting "Mosses" brings up the phylogeny for the Bryophyta.
Note that these common names (i.e., "mammals" or
"mosses") do not appear in the common name field in the
output for the sequence entries that are within the Mammalian or Bryophyta phylogenetic groups. Thus, the common name field could be very useful to identify organisms
and phylogenetically related organisms when you don't
know their genus/species organism name or the phylogeny for that group of organisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

Step 3. The last, critical step before submitting a query is
to select the sort order for the attributes in the output.
While a query will yield the same number of results with
any sort order, the choice of sort order can make answering questions easier. Take, for example, a search for all Eucarya rRNA entries. By default, the entries are sorted
alphabetically first by their phylogenetic classification,
followed by organism name, cell location, and last by
their RNA class. In contrast, the sort orders <phylogeny,
organism name, cell location, and RNA class> and <organism name, RNA class, phylogeny, and cell location>
produce significantly different orders and overall arrangements for the same set of entries (see online examples);
the second sorting is more useful when searching for a
particular organism, since its exact location on the phylogenetic tree may not be known to the user. The output
page (H-4A.2) reveals the search strategy and attribute sort
order at the bottom of the page. The default sort order for
the attributes is shown on the "S" (or sort) buttons on the
right side of the main frame (Figure 3 and H-4A.1). The
sort order is changed by simply clicking the "S" buttons in
the order the attributes are to be sorted. The resulting sort
order for the attributes are shown in the small text box to
the left of each attribute's S button; alternatively, you can
type numbers into these boxes to set the sort order. The alphabetical/numerical order for any attribute can be reversed (z -> a, high number -> low number) by checking
the box in the "R" (or reverse) column to the right of the
Sort buttons. Finally, the sortings can be reset to the default values by clicking the "Sort Reset" button at the top
of the query page.
Before submitting the query, a few attributes deserve more
attention.
• Secondary Structures: a comparative secondary structure
model has been developed for more than 400 of the sequence entries (see Section 3). The 'secondary structure'
attribute near the bottom of the query page is an option to
output all sequence and structure entries, only those entries with a secondary structure, or entries without a secondary structure diagram.
• Results/Page: the number of entries per output page can
be modulated. While the system defaults to 50 entries per
page, the maximum number of entries per output page
can be set to 20, 100, 200, and 400. The user can scroll to
those entries that do not appear on the first page by selecting the "Next" button on the left bottom frame in the output window and use the "Previous" button in the same
frame to move toward the first page, as necessary.
• Color Display: to help distinguish the organism names
on the output pages, the entries have the same color when
the organism names are the same. The colors (pink and

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

white) alternate for changes in the organism names in the
output entries.
• Group ID and Group Class: these two attributes are currently not fully functional; thus, we do not encourage
their use at this time.
• RNA Type/Class: currently, we do not have data entries
for the following RNA Types and Classes: mRNA, tRNA,
SnRNA, and Other.
After clicking the submit button at the top or bottom of
the query page, a new window will open. This window
distributes the results into three frames (H-4A.2). The
main frame contains the sequence and structure entries
that satisfy the search query. The frame in the lower left indicates the number of entries shown in the window and
the entry numbers currently shown, and, if necessary, contains buttons to scroll to the next or previous set of entries.
The third frame at the bottom middle-right displays the
total number of entries that satisfy the query, the search
strategy and the sort order for this query.
The three formats for the secondary structure diagrams,
PostScript, PDF, and BPSEQ (see Section 1A and the online help from the "Secondary Structure" and "StrDiags"
links on the RDBMS query and results pages) can be retrieved from the results window. The system defaults to
PostScript when the secondary structure link is clicked;
PDF or BPSEQ files can be obtained instead from the
structure link by selecting the corresponding radio button
at the top left section of the main frame. An explanation
of the structure link names (d.5, d.l6, d.235, d.233, b.Il,
and a.I2) and the longer names that are associated with
the downloaded structure files is also available online.
The GenBank accession number for each entry is a link to
a new window that retrieves the specified entry from NCBI. Sequence entries with more than one GenBank
number contain a "m" to the right of the accession
number. Clicking the "m" link opens a new window with
all of the GenBank numbers associated with this sequence.
Each entry is associated with a NCBI phylogeny listing
that can be retrieved in a new window by clicking the "m"
button in the Phylogeny column. This listing also contains the known common names associated with each level of the phylogenetic tree (H-4A.4). The phylogeny for all
of the entries in the results window is available in a new
window when the "M" button in the header line of the
phylogeny field is clicked.

4B. RDBMS (PhyloBrowser)
The PhyloBrowser interface to the CRW RDBMS was developed to facilitate the identification and retrieval of sequence and structure entries that are associated with
specific phylogenetic groups. While the Standard interface
will reveal all sequence entries for any one phylogenetic
group, it does not show the phylogenetic groups that do
not have the requested sequences; the PhyloBrowser interface displays the entire phylogenetic tree, including those
branches that do not have corresponding entries. This interface is based on the Taxonomy Browser developed by
NCBI [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/] and uses the NCBI taxonomy database
[60,61]. Here, we describe the PhyloBrowser interface,
ways to navigate through the phylogenetic data, and how
to retrieve RNA information using this system.

The PhyloBrowser uses three frames (Figure 4 and H4B.1). At the bottom of the page is the Results Frame
(white background), which displays the selected portion
of the phylogenetic tree and any RNA information. In the
upper left is the Selection Frame (pink background),
where the user can select the phylogenetic and RNA information shown in the Results Frame. Help is provided in
the Help Frame, at the upper right (blue background).
Starting at the root, the entire phylogenetic tree can be
navigated with this system. The base phylogenetic level
name is shown in green. The number of phylogenetic levels displayed (below the base level) can be modulated
from one (the default) to five levels using the "Display
Phylogenetic Levels" control in the Selection Frame. The
phylogenetic level number for each group is shown in red

preceding the phylogenetic group name, and common
name information, where available, is shown in black text
in parentheses after the group name. Each phylogenetic
group name is a link that reveals additional phylogenetic
levels (Figure 4 and H-4B.1), allowing the user to navigate
onto the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
In addition to this mode of transversing the phylogenetic
tree, starting at the root and knowing the pathway to the
desired end point, this system has the facility to jump to
specific places in the phylogenetic tree. The user can enter
a partial or complete scientific or common name in the
white text field in the lower, purple-colored panel of the
Selection Frame (e.g., "human;" see H-4B.2). Once the appropriate scientific or common name radio button is set,
different names that satisfy the user-entered text can be
viewed in the Results Frame by checking the "View" box.
Clicking the appropriate name in the Results Frame will
enter that name into the text field; unchecking the "View"
check box and clicking "Submit" will reveal the phylogenetic branch for this organism (H-4B.3).
To navigate toward the root of the phylogenetic tree, click
the "Parents" button in the Selection Frame. This will
open a new window with the complete NCBI phylogeny
from the root to the level of the organism of interest. This
window (H-4B.4) also reveals the phylogenetic level
number and common names. Simply clicking on a node
name in this window (e.g., the "Eutheria" node in H-4B.4)
will reveal this section of the phylogenetic tree in the Results Frame.
RNA information can be mapped onto the phylogenetic
tree in the Results Frame at any time. In the white panel in
the Selection Frame, the user can choose to view six RNA
types (5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA; group I, II and other introns) from five cellular locations (chloroplast, cyanelle,
mitochondria, nucleus, and viral) by checking the boxes
to the left of the desired selections. After clicking the white
"Submit" button, all entries that satisfy the RNA type and
cell location selections are mapped onto the phylogenetic
tree in the Results Frame (H-4B.3). There, the numbers of
sequences and structure diagrams available in our CRW
RDBMS are shown adjacent to each phylogenetic group
name at all levels of the phylogenetic tree and enclosed in
brackets; the format of this information for each individual RNA type is: [cell location, # sequences/# structures,
cell location, # sequences/# structures, ...]. The RNA types
are indicated in different colors (rRNA: 5S, green; 16S, red;
23S, blue; introns: group I, black; II, brown; other intron
types, magenta) and the cell locations are abbreviated (N,
nucleus; M, mitochondria; C, chloroplast; Y, cyanelle; V,
viral). These values in brackets link to the Standard RDBMS results page, as described in the previous section, and
allow the user to view the available sequence and structure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

information. The PhyloBrowser page (H-4B.3) reveals the
"Homo sapiens" phylogenetic group with the number of sequences and structures available in our CRW RDBMS for
RNA types (e.g., 16S and group I introns) that are present
in the selected cell locations (e.g., Chl, Mit, Nuc).
Additional documentation for the use of this page is available from the PhyloBrowser page. A short description is
displayed in the top-right frame by placing the mouse
over each of the attributes ("Molecule," "Cell Location,"
"Phylogenetic Levels," "Go to Parents," "Query," and "Acknowledgement"). Additional information for each of
these attributes is then displayed in a new window by
clicking on either the attribute link or the additional information link in the top-right frame (Figure 4 and H-4B.1).
4C. RNA Structure Query System
Currently, we are unable to reliably and accurately predict
an RNA structure from its underlying sequence due in part
to the lack of more fundamental RNA structure rules that
relate families of RNA sequences with specific RNA structural elements. Given this limitation, we have utilized
comparative analysis to determine that RNA structure that
is common to a set of functionally and structurally equivalent sequences. This analysis, as mentioned earlier, is
very accurate: nearly 98% of the basepairings in our 16S
and 23S rRNA comparative structure models are present
in the high-resolution crystal structures for the 30S [44]
and 50S [45] ribosomal subunits. In the process of predicting these comparative structure models, we have determined a large number of 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA and
group I intron comparative structure models from sequences that are representative of all types of structural
variations and conservation. Thus, with the correct rRNA
structure models and a large sampling of structurally diverse structure models, we now want to decipher more relationships between RNA sequences and RNA structural
elements. Toward this end, we developed a system for the
identification of biases in short sequences associated with
simple structural elements in our set of comparative structure models. The first set of examples reveals a sampling
of structure-based sequence biases. Recently, we utilized
this system to identify and quantitate the following biases
for adenosines in the Bacterial 16S and 23S rRNA covariation-based structure models [63]: 1) approximately 2/3
of the adenosines are unpaired; 2) more than 50% of the
3' ends of loops in the 16S and 23S rRNA have an A; 3)
there is a bias for adenosines to be adjacent to other adenosines (66% of these are at two unpaired positions, and
15% of these are at paired/unpaired junctions); and 4) the
majority of the As at the 3' end of loops are adjacent to a
paired G. These results were discerned with this system
and are shown in part in Figure 5 and H-4C.

BMC Bioinformatics 2002, 3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

within each of the structural elements listed (i.e., paired,
unpaired, etc.). This same figure reveals that 53.5% of the
3' end of loops contain an A. The unpaired to paired ratio
is shown in yellow in Figure 5 and H-4C.1; this ratio is
greatest for adenosines, where the value is nearly two (i.e.,
there are two unpaired adenosines for every A that is
paired), and lowest for C, where less than three out of ten
cytosines are unpaired. In contrast with the percentage
values in the orange boxes that reveal the percentage of
nucleotides within each structural element, the percentages in the green boxes reveal the distribution of nucleotides
in different structural elements for each nucleotide. For
example, 33.76% of the adenosines are paired, while
66.24% are unpaired. In contrast, 77.71% of the C's are
paired and only 22.29% of the C's are unpaired.
Figure 5
Analysis of the Bacterial 16S and 23S rRNA structure models
using the "RNA Structure Query System." The entire system
(selection frame and results) is shown with the results for
the distribution of single nucleotides, sorted in order of
decreasing prevalence in unpaired regions.

This RNA sequence/structure query system has three primary fields of input to be selected by the user: the RNA
type, phylogenetic group/cell location, and the nucleotide/structural element. The options for each of these
fields are listed in Table 5. The system currently supports
four RNA types (5S, 16S, and 23S rRNAs, and group I introns) and five phylogenetic groups/cell locations (Bacteria, Archaea, Eucarya nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial,
and chloroplast). Any combination and number of RNA
types and phylogenetic/cell location groups can be selected, although at least one RNA type and one phylogenetic/
cell location group must be selected. The bacterial 16S and
23S rRNAs were selected for the examples in Figure 5 and
H-4C. Five nucleotide categories are searchable: single nucleotides, (two) adjacent nucleotides, base pairs, three nucleotides, and four nucleotides. Each category can be
searched against a defined set of structural elements, as
outlined in Table 5. The structural elements for these nucleotide categories are based on 1) positions that are
paired and unpaired and 2) positions at the center or 5'
and 3' ends of helices and loops.

The most common adjacent nucleotides in any structural
environment in the Bacterial 16S and 23S rRNAs are GG
(9.86%; H-4C.2), while in loops the most common dinucleotides are AA (19.2%; H-4C.3), followed by GA
(13.35%), UA (9.821%), AU (6.703%), etc. The most frequent adjacent nucleotides at the 3'loop-5'helix junction
are AG (24.99%; H-4C.4), followed by AC (13.28%), GG
(8.28%), etc. For the adjacent AA sequences, nearly 75%
occur in loops, while approximately 12% of the AA sequences occur in helices, another 12% occur at the 3'loop5'helix junction, and less than 5% occur in 3'helix-5'loop
junctions. Thus, these analyses of single and adjacent nucleotides reveal several strong biases in the distribution of
nucleotides in different structural environments.
The top section of the output page (Figure 5 and H-4C.1)
displays the types of data (RNA molecules and phylogenetic/cell location groups) that were selected and analyzed. This section also reveals the number of structure
models that were analyzed; 175 16S and 71 23S rRNA
structure models were analyzed in Figure 5 and H-4C.
A few of the other biases in the distribution of nucleotide
patterns that were determined with this sequence/structure query system of our comparative structure models are
displayed in Table 6. A more detailed accounting of this
information is available online.

Auxiliary components of the CRW site
The sorting function dynamically ranks the nucleotide
patterns. The resulting output reveals, for any of the selected structural elements, the most frequent nucleotide pattern, followed by other patterns in descending order to the
least frequent nucleotide pattern. For the "A Story" example mentioned earlier, adenosine is the most frequent nucleotide at unpaired positions (42.64%), followed by G
(23.6%), U (21.27%), and C (12.49%) (Figure 5 and H4C.1). These values are contained in the orange columns,
and reveal the percentages for each of the nucleotides

In addition to the sections described above, the CRW Site
also includes online appendices to work published elsewhere. The "Structure, Motifs, and Folding" section presently contains three RNA motif projects ("U-Tum" [62],
"A Story" [63], and "AA.AG@helix.ends" [64]) and two
RNA folding projects ("16S rRNA Folding" [65] and "23S
rRNA Folding" [66]). In the "Phylogenetic Structure Analysis" section, additional information for three publications is available: "Mollusk Mitochondria" [67], "Polytoma
Leucoplasts" [68], and "Algal Introns" [69].

Conclusions
Nearly 10 years ago, our initial goals for our RNA web
page was to disseminate some of the comparative information we collected and analyzed for our prediction of
16S and 23S rRNA structure with comparative analysis.
With dramatic increases in the number of ribosomal RNA
sequences, we developed a relational database system to
organize basic information about each sequence and
structure entry to maintain an inventory of our collection,
and to retrieve any one or set of entries that satisfy the conditions of the search. In parallel, with the significant advancements in computational and networking hardware
and software, our need for more detailed and quantitative
comparative information for each RNA molecule under
study, and our interest in studying more RNA molecules
beyond 16S and 23S rRNA, we have greatly expanded our
web site, and named it the "Comparative RNA Web"
(CRW) Site.
The major types of information available for each RNA
molecule are:
1) the current comparative RNA structure model;
2) nucleotide and base pair frequency tables for all positions in the reference structure;
3) secondary structure conservation diagrams that reveal
the extent of conservation in the RNA sequence and structure;
4) representative secondary structure diagrams for organisms from phylogenetic groups that span the phylogenetic
tree and reveal the major forms of structural variation;
5) a semi-complete/partial collection of publicly available
sequences that are 90% or more complete; and
6) sequence alignments.
At this time, we maintain the most current comparative
sequence and structure information about the 16S and
23S rRNA. The other RNA molecules we maintain (5S rRNA, tRNA, and group I and II introns) are not as advanced
at the time of this writing.
Our future aims for the CRW Site are to: 1) maintain a
complete collection of sequences in our database management system for each of the RNAs under study; 2) once or
twice a year, release new sequence alignments that contain
A) improvements (if necessary) in the positioning of the
sequences that are associated with similar structural elements, and B) increases in the number of aligned sequences; 3) generate more secondary structure diagrams for
sequences that span the phylogenetic tree and reveal all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

forms of structural variation; 4) generate more secondary
structure conservation diagrams and nucleotide and base
pair frequency tables for more phylogenetic groups (e.g.
Fungi: Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota); 5)
update the structure models when warranted by the analysis; 6) update current nucleotide and base pair frequency
tables when the alignments they are derived from have
been updated, and generate more frequency tables for
more phylogenetic groups (see "4)" above); 7) add new
types of comparative RNA sequence/structure information and new modes of presenting the data; and 8) analyze more types of RNA molecules from a comparative
perspective, and present this data in the same formats utilized for the RNA molecules currently supported.

Materials and Methods
Sequence collection
The majority of the sequence alignments presented at the
CRW Site were assembled in the Gutell laboratory. The
alignments that were based on another laboratory's initial
effort and enlarged and refined for the CRW project are: 1)
the prokaryotic (Archaea and Bacteria) alignments for 16S
rRNA [85]; 2) the 5S rRNA alignments [55]; and 3) the
tRNA alignments [81]. The group I and II intron alignments were originally based upon sequences collected by
Michel [32,34].

New rRNA and intron sequences were found by searching
the nucleic acid sequence database at GenBank using the
NCBI Entrez system [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/] at least once per week with appropriate search criteria (e.g., "rrna" [Feature key] and "intron" [Feature key] to
find introns that occur in rRNA). While the majority of the
RNA sequences of importance to this database are available online at GenBank, a few sequences are only available
in the literature (e.g., the Urospora penicilliformis intron
[86]) or in a thesis; these sequences were manually entered into the appropriate sequence alignment. A few sequences were found in GenBank with the sequence
similarity searching program BLAST [87]. At this time, we
are only trying to identify all sequences that are more than
90% complete since all sequences that are less than 90%
complete are not currently retrieved with the CRW RDBMS.
Deviations in GenBank entries
The majority of GenBank entries contain accurate annotations of the RNAs. However, some GenBank entries deviate from this norm in a variety of ways. In some entries,
the presence of the rRNA was not annotated and the rRNA
was found by searching for short sequences that are characteristic of that rRNA (a few examples). Sometimes, intron sequences are not annotated and were discovered
during the alignment of the corresponding rRNA exons
(e.g., the unannotated intron in the uncultured archaeon

RNA sequence alignment and classification of intron sequences
Alignment and determination of intron-exon boundaries
The sequence alignments used for this analysis are maintained by us at the University of Texas; these alignments,
containing all publicly available sequences used in the
analysis, are or will be available from the CRW Site [http:/
/www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu] (Table 2). rRNA, Type 1
tRNA, and intron sequences were manually aligned to
maximize sequence and structural identity using the

alignment editor AE2 (T. Macke, Scripps Clinic, San Diego, CA). The rRNA alignments are sorted by phylogeny
and cell location, the intron alignments are sorted by subgroup, exon, insertion point (for rRNA introns), and phylogeny, and the tRNA alignments are sorted by aminoacyl
type and phylogeny. Alignment of the rRNA exons (when
available) between closely-related sequences provided an
independent evaluation of the intron-exon borders for
each intron-containing rRNA sequence; the large number
of rRNA sequences in our collection and the high level of
sequence conservation at intron insertion points provide
great confidence in this evaluation.
Classification of introns
Group I and II intron sequences were classified into one
of the structural subgroups defined by Michel [32,34] or
the more recently determined subgroup IE [82] based
upon sequence and structural homology to previouslyaligned sequences. Uncertainties in these assignments
come from two main sources. First, some introns are referred to in rRNA GenBank entries without the intron sequence being provided; in these cases, we represent the
intron as having length "NSEQ" (No SEQuence information) and accept the authors' major intron classification
(e.g., group I or group II) but not the specific intron type
(e.g., if an author classified an intron as IA1 and did not
publish the sequence, our system designates its type as
"I"). In the second case, we do have sequence information
but cannot fully classify the intron with confidence; here,
we provide the most plausible classification. The classifications "I" and "II," respectively, are group I and II introns
of undefined subtype. An intron described as "IB' has the
characteristic features of the IB subgroup but cannot be
subclassified as IB1, IB2, IB3, or IB4. Those introns that do
not belong to either group I or group II are generally classified as "Unknown" in the "RNA Class" field (see Section
4A and Table 4); included in this category are the Archaeal
and spliceosomal introns. At present, the Archaeal and
spliceosomal introns are identified with the phrases "Archaeal" and "spliceosomal," respectively, in the Comment
field of the RDBMS; a standard designation for these introns will be added to a future version of the system. Although the introns in our collection have been judiciously
placed into one of the intron subgroups and are roughly
correct, these intron placements will be reanalyzed to assure the accurate assignment of subgroups.
Identification of unannotated or misannotated introns, with examples
Some examples of introns that were identified or clarified
by the alignment process are: 1) Aureoumbra lagunensis
(U40258; the intron was annotated as an insertion); 2)
Exophiala dermatitidis (X78481; the intron was not annotated); and 3) Chara sp. Qiu 96222 (AF191800; the intron
annotations were shifted approximately 15 positions toward the 5' end of the rRNA sequence).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/2

About TBD and NSEQ
Information that could not be determined either from the
GenBank entries or by using these methods is represented
in the RDBMS system as TBD (To Be Determined). When
a sequence is known but not available (for example, when
an intron is inferred from a rRNA GenBank entry), the sequence length and percent completeness are instead represented as NSEQ (No SEQuence), to show that the
sequence itself is not available.
Database System
Contents of the RDBMS (general and intron-specific)
The relational database management system (RDBMS)
available from the Comparative RNA Web Site [http://
www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu] described in this work utilizes
the MySQL engine [http://www.mysql.com/] . The system
contains vital statistics for each sequence (Table 4). The
primary fields are: 1) organism name; 2) complete phylogeny; 3) cell location; 4) RNA type (general category; e.g.,
rRNA or intron); 5) RNA class (more detailed identification; e.g., 16S or IC1); 6) GenBank Accession Number
(linked to GenBank); and 7) secondary structure diagrams
for selected sequences. Intron-specific data stored in the
system are the exon, intron number (index for multiple
introns from a single exon), intron position (for rRNA introns only: the E. coli (GenBank Accession Number
J01695) equivalent position number immediately before
the intron), and open reading frame presence. Note that
only sequences that are at least 90% complete are made
available through this system. The majority of this data is
manually entered into the database system; one exception
is the complete NCBI phylogeny database [60,61], which
is automatically downloaded and incorporated into this
system daily so that all RDBMS entries appear using the
current NCBI scientific name for a given organism.
Changes to the RDBMS phylogeny data are identified automatically during the incorporation process and then updated manually. Any changes made to the data become
available to the public on the next day.
Secondary Structure and Conservation Diagrams
Secondary structure and conservation diagrams were developed entirely or in part with the interactive graphics
program XRNA (Weiser & Noller, University of California,
Santa Cruz). The PostScript files output by XRNA were
converted into PDF using ghostscript (version 7.00; [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.htm] ).

Authentication system
The Comparative RNA Web Site has instituted an authorization system for its users. Information is collected to assist in web server administration and error tracking. On
their initial visits, users will select a username, provide a
current email address (for verificiation purposes), and review the terms and conditions for use of the CRW Site. An
email will be sent to the provided email address containing a validation URL for that account. At this URL, the user
may provide additional information; the system will then
email an initial password to the user at the selected email
account. The user then has the two pieces of information
(username and password) necessary to log in and use the
CRW Site. Once logged in, the user may change the password and update the user information at any time.

URL rewriting
We strongly encourage all users to access the Comparative
RNA Web Site [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu] using
its main address, [http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/] ,
rather than through specific URLs. As the site grows, specific pages may be moved, changed, or deleted. As well,
use of more specific URLs may not include the navigation
system for the site, providing the user with a suboptimal
operating experience of the entire site. Therefore, the system is configured to route an initial request for a more
specific URL to an introductory page, which will offer users access to the main page and a selection of specific
URLs.
