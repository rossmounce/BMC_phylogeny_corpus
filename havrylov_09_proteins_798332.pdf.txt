Abstract
Background: Ruk/CIN85 is a mammalian adaptor molecule with three SH3 domains. Using its
SH3 domains Ruk/CIN85 can cluster multiple proteins and protein complexes, and, consequently,
facilitates organisation of elaborate protein interaction networks with diverse regulatory roles.
Previous research linked Ruk/CIN85 with the regulation of vesicle-mediated transport and cancer
cell invasiveness. Despite the recent findings, precise molecular functions of Ruk/CIN85 in these
processes remain largely elusive and further research is hampered by a lack of complete lists of its
partner proteins.
Results: In the present study we employed a LC-MS/MS-based experimental pipeline to identify a
considerable number (over 100) of proteins recruited by the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 in vitro.
Most of these identifications are novel Ruk/CIN85 interaction candidates. The identified proteins
have diverse molecular architectures and can interact with other proteins, as well as with lipids and
nucleic acids. Some of the identified proteins possess enzymatic activities. Functional profiling
analyses and literature mining demonstrate that many of the proteins recruited by the SH3 domains
of Ruk/CIN85 identified in this work were involved in the regulation of membranes and cytoskeletal
structures necessary for vesicle-mediated transport and cancer cell invasiveness. Several groups of
the proteins were also associated with few other cellular processes not previously related to Ruk/
CIN85, most prominently with cell division.
Conclusion: Obtained data support the notion that Ruk/CIN85 regulates vesicle-mediated
transport and cancer cell invasiveness through the assembly of multimeric protein complexes
governing coordinated remodelling of membranes and underlying cytoskeletal structures, and imply
its important roles in formation of coated vesicles and biogenesis of invadopodia. In addition, this
study points to potential involvement of Ruk/CIN85 in other cellular processes, chiefly in cell
division.

Background
Ruk/CIN85 is a mammalian adaptor molecule with three
SH3 domains. In addition to the SH3 domains located at
the N-terminal part of the protein, Ruk/CIN85 contains
other protein interaction modules, namely proline-rich
sequences and a coiled-coil region (see Additional file 1).
By sequence homology and domain architecture Ruk/
CIN85 is closely related to another mammalian adaptor
molecule CD2AP/CMS [1]. Due to the similarity of their
SH3 domains, Ruk/CIN85 and CD2AP/CMS recognise
the same atypical proline-arginine PX(P/A)XXR motif and
reveal partially overlapping specificity towards interaction
partners [2,3]. Presence of the multiple protein interaction modules, particularly of the SH3 domains, endows
both these adaptors with the capacity to engage a variety
of proteins with wide range of activities and assemble the
multimeric protein complexes of various composition
and cellular functions. In other words, via the clustering of
multiple proteins and protein complexes, Ruk/CIN85 and
CD2AP/CMS facilitate the organisation of elaborate protein interaction networks with diverse regulatory roles.
Previous research linked Ruk/CIN85 with various cellular
functions such as signal transduction, vesicle-mediated
transport and membrane trafficking, rearrangement of
cytoskeletal structures, regulation of cell adhesion, cancer
cell invasiveness and cell death [1,4-9]. Recent studies
indicate that contribution of Ruk/CIN85 to regulation of
membrane trafficking and cancer cell invasiveness is particularly important [9-11]. Localisation studies show that
Ruk/CIN85 acts at different cellular membranes and
membrane trafficking compartments. In our previous
study we have observed endogenous Ruk/CIN85 primarily at the COPI-coated membranes and the vesicles of the
Golgi complex, and occasionally at the edges of protrusive
actin-rich structures of migrating cells [11]. Ruk/CIN85
also functions as an important component of invadopodia – adhesive actin-rich membrane protrusions of invasive cancer cells [9].
Despite significant attention paid by researchers to Ruk/
CIN85 in recent years, the precise molecular functions of
this adaptor molecule remain largely elusive and, in certain cases, discrepant. For example, the participation of
Ruk/CIN85 in endocytic membrane transport has been
challenged by several recent studies [12,13]. Additional
experiments are necessary to resolve this controversy. Further research on the molecular functions of Ruk/CIN85 is
hampered not only by insufficient in vivo functional studies but, to a great extent, also by a lack of complete list of
proteins recruited by this adaptor. Since activity of Ruk/
CIN85 in different cellular processes is determined solely
by its ability to cluster other protein molecules, identification of the complete list of proteins recruited by each of
the protein interaction modules found in Ruk/CIN85 may

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/21

provide a wealth of information for the better understanding of its molecular functions.
In the present study we identified lists of proteins
recruited in vitro by all of the three SH3 domains of Ruk/
CIN85 using the high-throughput technique combining
affinity purification of interaction partners from cell
lysates with following liquid chromatography-coupled
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Subsequently,
we subjected the obtained lists to functional profiling and
association network analysis to infer potential functions
of protein interaction networks organised on the SH3
domains of this adaptor molecule.

Results
Variety and modular architectures of the proteins
recruited by the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85
In the present study we utilised the liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)based approach to identify the lists of the proteins
recruited by the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 in vitro. This
sensitive and precise tool for detection of multiple proteins in complex mixtures has not been used to study
interactions mediated by Ruk/CIN85 so far.

Using the experimental pipeline comprised of GST pulldowns, SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS, we identified 107 proteins recruited by the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 (Table
1, see Additional file 2 for more details). Most of these
identifications (approximately 90%) were novel interaction candidates, which had not been previously reported
to bind Ruk/CIN85, neither in direct nor in indirect ways.
Only twelve of the identified proteins including GTPaseactivating proteins RICH1 and ASAP1/AMAP1, adaptor/
scaffold molecules Sb1, CFBP, AIP1, Dab2, 3BP-2 and
Atx2, E3 ubiquitin ligases c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and two inositol5'-phosphatases synaptojanins 1 and 2 were previously
implicated in the interactions with Ruk/CIN85 (see ref.
[14] for most recent review).
For initial classification, the identified proteins were
grouped according to their modular architectures. Resulting classification distinguished the four major protein
classes encompassing (1) proteins containing lipid interaction modules, (2) proteins with modules able to bind
nucleic acids, (3) proteins containing only protein interaction modules and (4) proteins with enzymatic activities
(Table 1). Within this classification, group 3 was the largest one. Except for ubiquitous coiled-coil and proline-rich
regions, these proteins frequently had SH3, SH2, TPR and
WD40 domains known to be involved in protein-protein
interactions (Fig. 1). This group also harboured the distinct subgroups of proteins with actin binding modules
(mostly CH and WH2 domains), modules required for
interaction with microtubules or for microtubule assem-

Surprisingly, the significant group of the identified proteins contained modules implicated in interactions with
nucleic acids. This group included proteins with both
RNA and DNA interaction modules, with prevalence of
RNA-binding molecules. RRM RNA-binding domains and
SAM dual specificity RNA/protein-binding domains were
among interaction modules frequently found in the identified proteins (Fig. 1). Notably, RRMs were found not
only in the novel Ruk/CIN85 interaction candidates, but
also in synaptojanins 1 and 2 – the two known interaction
partners of this adaptor molecule (see Table 1).

bly, and also the subgroup of atypical cytoskeletal GTPbinding proteins called septins.
More than a half of proteins from the lipid-binding group
were classified as adaptor molecules with lipid and protein interaction modules. Except for two dynamin
GTPases, the rest of proteins (approximately 80%) with
lipid interaction modules were represented by the
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Rho family
GTPases. Most of the lipid-binding candidates contained
PH domains – lipid/protein interaction modules specific
towards phosphoinositides, and frequently also towards
proteins. Notably, in comparison with the other modules
(excluding coiled-coil and proline-rich regions), PHs were
the most common domains in the identified proteins
(Fig. 1).
The proteins with enzymatic activities were classified as
inositol-5'-phosphatases, protein kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases. Several other proteins of this group contained

Potential recognition consensus sites for the SH3 domains
of Ruk/CIN85 in the identified proteins
To define which of the identified proteins were likely to
interact with Ruk/CIN85 directly we analysed their amino
acid sequences for the presence of potential recognition
consensus sites for the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 using
Scansite software. For this purpose we employed the
experimental data on consensus peptide composition for
the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 reported previously by
Kurakin et al. [2] to design matrices used for analysis (see
Experimental Procedures section for details). Scansite
analysis performed with these matrices identified potential recognition consensus sites for the SH3 domains of
Ruk/CIN85 in 77 of 107 proteins (Table 1). Provided that
the samples obtained by the affinity purification on the
SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 were expected to be significantly enriched in proteins containing binding sites for
these domains, results of the analysis were not surprising,
and indicated that up to 71% of proteins found in the
samples might bind to the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85
directly. Other 29% of the identifications might combine
proteins co-purified with the direct interaction partners,
and in some cases, minor impurities.
Overlapping specificity of the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85
and evolutionary origin of Ruk/CIN85
Among the proteins with potential recognition consensus
sites for the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85, and hence likely
to interact with these domains directly, more then a half
(64%) was identified simultaneously in the samples for
two of three different SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85, and
almost one third (27%) was found in the samples for all
the three domains (Table 1). These data indicate that the
SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 are redundant in terms of
their affinity towards interaction partners, which reflects
similarity of recognition consensus sequences shared by
these domains [2]. Interestingly, although all of the SH3
domains of Ruk/CIN85 recognise the same peptide ligand
core sequence, PX(P/A)XXR, SH3A and SH3C domains
share significantly more interaction partners, than SH3A

Proteome Science 2009, 7:21

or SH3C with SH3B do (Table 1). Of even more interest,
recent study utilising NMR spectroscopy have demonstrated that despite sharing the same peptide ligand core
sequence, SH3A and SH3B domains of Ruk/CIN85 use
different mechanisms to bind their ligands [15].
One possible explanation for the higher similarity of
SH3A and SH3C domains with respect to their interaction
affinities might stem from their evolutionary origin. To
verify this assumption, we performed the phylogenetic
analysis of the sequences of all mouse and human SH3
domains deposited in Pfam database [16]. The analysis
revealed that all of the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 were
closely related, and, probably, had originated during the
early evolution of mammals via the sequential duplication of a progenitor SH3 domain to generate initially
ancestor SH3B and SH3C domains, and then ancestor
SH3A domain via duplication of the SH3C ancestor (Fig.
2; see Additional file 4 for the whole phylogenetic tree of
all SH3 domains analysed). Finally, the progenitor adaptor protein containing three SH3 domains present in early
mammals gave origin to Ruk/CIN85 and CD2AP/CMS,
the two closely homologous adaptor proteins with similar
domain structure found in contemporary mammal species. According to this scenario, SH3A and SH3C domains
are more evolutionary related, and therefore, likely to
have more similar structure and, hence, to be more redundant in their interaction affinities.

Functional clusters of the identified interaction candidates
To obtain the functional profile of the proteins recruited
by the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85, we clustered them
according to functional annotations using DAVID (a database for annotation, visualisation and integrated discovery) [17]. In a complementary approach, we created the
network of physical interactions and functional associations between these proteins using STRING (the metadatabase search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/
proteins) [18] and mapped the resulting list of functional
annotations onto this network. Both DAVID and STRING
had their own limitations, and combination of these tools
allowed to improve the quality of functional profiling.
While DAVID analysis alone was more suitable for the
annotation of functions enriched in the set of identified
proteins in general (Fig. 3), results of STRING analysis
showed interactions between the proteins and, in combination with the functional annotation, reflected potential
multimeric protein complexes existing within the network
(Fig. 4). Analysis performed by each of these tools covered
approximately 75% of the proteins from the list of the
Ruk/CIN85 interaction candidates, which is reasonably
good result, because only about 20% of the human genes
have been functionally annotated to date [19].

Initially, DAVID tool was used to cluster the proteins by
their occurrence in different cellular locations. Two large
meaningful clusters identified this way included proteins
associated with the cytoskeleton and membranes (Fig.
3A). Next, the analysis of clustering of proteins by their
involvement in different cellular processes was performed. The list obtained as the result of this analysis
comprised of many functional clusters. As we expected,
some of these clusters converged proteins with the cellular
functions, that were previously associated with Ruk/
CIN85, such as signal transduction, cytoskeleton organisation and biogenesis, vesicle-mediated transport, cell
adhesion and programmed cell death (Fig, 3B). Some of
these clusters apparently lacked some of the proteins, primarily because of their incomplete annotation in Gene
Ontology database. This was particularly evident in the
case of proteins taking part in vesicle-mediated transport.
For example, the cluster of these proteins included c-Cbl
and synaptojanin 1, but neither Cbl-b and synaptojanin 2
– their closely related homologues with similar functions,
nor Dab2 and ASAP1 – the known Ruk/CIN85 interaction
partners with well documented roles in membrane vesicle
trafficking. At the same time, all these proteins were
highly associated and located at the same cluster of protein association network obtained in STRING (Fig. 4A). In
addition to proteins involved in vesicle-mediated transport, this cluster combined proteins involved in signal
transduction and in organisation of actin cytoskeleton.
Not surprisingly this cluster was also rich in the known
Ruk/CIN85 interaction partners present in the network.

Unexpectedly, except for the protein clusters with Ruk/
CIN85-related functions, both the resulting DAVID annotation list and the protein association network obtained in
STRING contained clusters of proteins with the functions,
which were not associated with this adaptor before. Two
of these clusters combined proteins related to regulation
of cell cycle and cell division (cytokinesis), and involved
in RNA/mRNA processing (Fig. 3C; Fig. 4B, C), suggestive
of previously unknown cellular roles of Ruk/CIN85.

Discussion
Ruk/CIN85 at the interface of membranes and the
cytoskeleton
Growing body of evidence indicates that Ruk/CIN85 acts
at the interface of membranes and the cytoskeleton. The
synchronous rearrangements of membranes and associated cytoskeletal structures underlie many important cellular events such as cell motility and vesicle-mediated
transport (membrane trafficking). Motile cells are constantly remodelling their membranes and the cytoskeleton to generate adhesive and protrusive structures
required for migration, and cancer cells use the subversions of such structures to invade surrounding tissues.
Coordinated remodelling of membranes and the cytoskeleton is also required to generate membrane vesicles and
transport them between different intracellular membrane
trafficking compartments.

Therefore, it was not surprising that Ruk/CIN85 had been
previously found to be implicated in the regulation of
both these processes, and majority of proteins recruited by
the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 identified here localise to
membranes or cytoskeletal structures.
Recent studies suggest that physiologically diverse cellular
processes, which require integration of membranes with
the adjacent cytoskeleton, including vesicle-mediated
transport, cell adhesion, migration and invasion may use
compatible molecular mechanisms utilising similar sets
of proteins and interactions. For this reason interactions
between Ruk/CIN85 and such promiscuous proteins are
of particular interest. For instance, previously Ruk/CIN85
has been implicated in the interaction with Arf GTPaseactivating protein ASAP1/AMAP1, which is one of the core
components of invadopodia in invasive cancer cells, and
also regulates focal adhesions, circular dorsal ruffles and
membrane trafficking [20,21]. Several such proteins are
among the novel Ruk/CIN85 interaction candidates identified here. Two of them, N-WASP, a regulator of Arp2/3mediated actin nucleation and elongation at membranes,
and Dynamin 2, a mechanoenzyme capable to promote
tubulation and fission of membranes, are worth of special
attention. Both these proteins act in a coordinated manner at the protrusive structures of motile cells and at

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/21

diverse membrane trafficking compartments [22-24].
Both are also the core components of invadopodia [25].
The results obtained so far indicate that Ruk/CIN85 acts at
different cellular locations. However, the exact map is
only beginning to emerge and analysis of effector molecules clustered by this adaptor may help to establish a better image. Variety of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)
recruited by the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 may serve as
an excellent example. The GAPs for Rho and Arf family
GTPases (RhoGAPs and ArfGAPs) are the substantial portion of proteins recruited by the SH3 domains of Ruk/
CIN85 involved in membrane and cytoskeleton remodelling. Previously Ruk/CIN85 has been implicated in the
interactions with two RhoGAPs (CAMGAP1, RICH1), one
Arf GAP (ASAP1/AMAP1), and a Arf/Rho dual-specificity
GAP (ARAP3) [10,26,27]. Another Arf/Rho dual-specificity GAP ARAP1, and several RhoGAPs (MgcRacGAP,
srGAP, SYDE1) are among the Ruk/CIN85 interaction
candidates identified here. ArfGAPs and RhoGAPs control
activities of Arf and Rho family GTPases, which are the key
regulators of membrane and actin organisation [20,28].
Noteworthy, the GAPs of both these classes outnumber
the corresponding target GTPases, and are consequently
regarded as their location-specific regulators [28].
Even though the majority of RhoGAPs recruited by the
SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 are active towards Cdc42
GTPase, their sites of action are strikingly different. Scene
for dual-specificity Arf/RhoGAP ARAP1 and ArfGAP
ASAP1/AMAP1 is even more complex, because both act
simultaneously at the cell interior and at the cell periphery. Taken together, the activities of the GTPase-activating
proteins recruited by the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 are
distributed between a vast range of membranes and membrane compartments, ranging from the plasma membrane
and protrusive/adhesive actin-rich structures such as focal
adhesions, circular dorsal ruffles, lamellipodia, filopodia
and invadopodia at the cell periphery to internal membrane trafficking compartments including the Golgi complex [20,21,26-33]. Diversity of the partner GAPs and the
overlap of their localisation with cellular distribution of
Ruk/CIN85 may therefore provide a plausible model
explaining promiscuity of this adaptor towards different
membranes and membrane trafficking compartments.
According to this model, Ruk/CIN85 might act at the
Golgi complex with ARAP1, whereas at different peripheral protrusive structures including lamellipodia and invadopodia with ASAP1/AMAP1, ARAP3 and RICH1. Ruk/
CIN85 might also act with ARAP1 and ASAP1/AMAP1
along the endocytosis-recycling pathway. However, significance of Ruk/CIN85 for this process is in question and
remains to be clarified (discussed in the next section).

Ruk/CIN85 and vesicle-mediated trafficking
Our present data indicate that via the SH3 domains Ruk/
CIN85 may recruit a number of protein molecules
required for the proper formation and function of coated
vesicles. Majority of these proteins, including dynamins,
inositol-5'-phosphatase synaptojanin 1 and N-WASP are
recruited to coated pits at the late steps of coated vesicle
formation to complete vesicle fission [34-36].

In line with these observations, early studies implicated
Ruk/CIN85 in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles
during the endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases, and
particularly of the EGF receptors [4]. Proposed model
assumed that Ruk/CIN85 clusters activated receptor complexes with A-type endophilines A1, A2 or A3 (endocytic
machinery proteins, which use their BAR domains to
sense and shape membranes) to facilitate membrane
invagination during the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. However, the conflicting results of two subsequent
studies [12,13], and a lack of endogenous Ruk/CIN85 in
both early and late endocytic compartments [11] questioned this view.
In our previous study, we observed only the weak presence of Ruk/CIN85 at compartments involved in clathrinmediated endocytosis and sorting, while it was abundant
at membrane trafficking compartments free of clathrin,
primarily at the COPI-coated membranes and vesicles of
the Golgi complex, and on some vesicular structures
throughout the cell [11]. Based on these observations, it is
reasonable to conclude that Ruk/CIN85 is likely to play
more important role in the biogenesis of vesicles covered
with coats other then clathrin, for instance of COPIcoated vesicles. Consistent with this, c-Cbl, the E3 ubiquitin ligase thought to engage Ruk/CIN85 to the activated
EGF receptors [4], had been also implicated in processes
at the Golgi complex [37], and thus could mediate the
recruitment of Ruk/CIN85 to the Golgi membranes. Similarly, N-WASP in addition to its role in endocytosis, had
been implicated in the regulation of actin polymerisation
on COPI-coated membranes of the Golgi complex, and
the mechanisms of N-WASP-mediated actin assembly
observed at different coats were strikingly similar [38,39].
At the same time, consideration that Ruk/CIN85 acts
exclusively at COPI-coated membranes have also some
drawbacks. For instance, some of the Ruk/CIN85 interaction partners and candidates involved in endocytosis,
such as A-type endophilins and dynamins, clearly do not
function in biogenesis of COPI-coated vesicles [40].
Therefore, more a feasible explanation is that distinct
pools of Ruk/CIN85 act at different membrane trafficking
compartments through engagement of exclusive sets of
proteins. This notion presumes, however, the existence of
mechanism(s) to generate the populations of Ruk/CIN85
molecules with distinct properties. It is of interest, that our

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/21

present data demonstrate that the SH3 domains of Ruk/
CIN85 could bind cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase c-Abl,
which had been implicated in the negative regulation of
EGFR endocytosis via the impairment of c-Cbl-receptor
interaction [41]. We therefore speculate that the recruitment of c-Abl by Ruk/CIN85 may serve as a mechanism to
exclude some Ruk/CIN85 partners from the protein complexes, retain it (and c-Cbl) away from the plasma membrane and release for other cellular processes.
It has been previously suggested that scaffolding functions
of Ruk/CIN85 in membrane transport are not limited to
the formation of coated vesicles, but may also extend to
the regulation of subsequent vesicle trafficking events
[10]. In favour of this hypothesis, the SH3 domains of
Ruk/CIN85 recruit diverse proteins implicated in distinct
membrane trafficking events. Some of them, such as adaptor proteins AIP1/Alix and Dab2 are the known Ruk/
CIN85 interaction partners [42,43]. Other proteins,
including adaptor Vps37b, serine/threonine kinase
PCTAIRE-1 or inositol-5'-phosphatase SHIP2 are the
novel interaction candidates [44-46].
Intriguingly, Ruk/CIN85 itself displays several features
characteristic for the components of vesicle coats. First,
recruitment of Ruk/CIN85 to (the Golgi) membranes is
modulated by Arf1 GTPase activity [11]. Second, Ruk/
CIN85 can recruit variety of GTPase-activating proteins
[[10,26,27] and this study]. Third, Ruk/CIN85 is able to
oligomerise via its coiled-coil regions [47] and intermolecular SH3 domain – proline-rich region interactions [5].
Such homotypic oligomerisation may serve as an intrinsic
mechanism to retain Ruk/CIN85 at membranes, making
it similar to the coat constituent proteins. Thereby, we
suggest that during different membrane trafficking events
Ruk/CIN85, at least in part, may function as the component of vesicle coats. Since main coat component proteins
are rarely dedicated to one particular function, this
hypothesis may explain abundance and functional diversity of the proteins implicated in the interactions with
Ruk/CIN85, as well as its presence at different membrane
trafficking compartments and at distant vesicle transport
intermediates scattered throughout the cell. This hypothesis is also in agreement with the previously proposed
idea that Ruk/CIN85 acts at the consecutive steps of membrane trafficking events by continuous exchange of interaction partners [10].
Ruk/CIN85 and cancer cell invasiveness
Current research indicates that Ruk/CIN85 may be an
important regulator of cancer cell invasiveness [9]. It has
been found that together with ASAP1/AMAP1 Ruk/CIN85
is necessary for the biogenesis of invadopodia [9]. These
protrusive actin-rich membrane structures are found only
in invasive cancer cells, but molecularly and functionally

Page 11 of 19

Proteome Science 2009, 7:21

are similar to podosomes – the foot processes of several
types of cells [25,48]. Proteolytic activities of invadopodia
allow aggressive cancer cells to degrade extracellular
matrix (ECM) and spread through surrounding tissues
[49]. The interaction between Ruk/CIN85 and ASAP1/
AMAP1 is critical to maintain the invasive phenotype of
some breast cancer cell lines [9]. It was suggested that
Ruk/CIN85 might regulate invadopodia via the recruitment of c-Cbl to ASAP1/AMAP1 and facilitation of the cCbl-mediated ubiquitination of this GTPase-acivating
protein [9]. However, such regulatory role of Ruk/CIN85
at invadopodia may also span onto other targets. For
instance, except ASAP1/AMAP1 Ruk/CIN85 interacts with
inositol-5'-phosphatases synaptojanin 2 and SHIP1,
which were also implicated in biogenesis of invadopodia
and podosomes [50,51], and with non-receptor tyrosine
kinase Src, which is the principal regulator of both cellular
structures [49].
Our present data show that current view on the functional
involvement of Ruk/CIN85 in invadopodia biogenesis
may be oversimplified. Several proteins identified here as
the novel interaction candidates for the SH3 domains of
Ruk/CIN85 have well documented roles in this process.
From these, N-WASP, N-WASP-interacting adaptor molecule WIP, and dynamin 2 are among the key regulators of
invadopodia biogenesis [25]. N-WASP and WIP regulate
invadopodia via the promotion of the Arp2/3-mediated
assembly of branched actin arrays [49,52]. Despite of the
proved importance of dynamin 2 to invadopodia, its
functions there have not been yet defined. Two possibilities include regulation of associated membrane trafficking
and/or regulation of actin assembly [25]. Additionally,
most of the GTPase-activating proteins recruited by the
SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 regulate Cdc42, which activates Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly via N-WASP, and
have been recently shown to act upstream invadopodia
formation [48].
Even though molecular mechanisms underlying invadopodia biogenesis remain mostly obscure, the short list
of proteins identified so far indicates that invadopodia are
closely related to podosomes and contain molecular components of focal adhesions [25]. Consistent with these
relations, several of the novel Ruk/CIN85 interaction candidates identified here, such as non-receptor tyrosine
kinase c-Abl, WIP-related N-WASP-binding protein WIRE,
synaptopodin and cell adhesion receptor protein dystroglycan 1, were previously implicated in the regulation of
these cellular structures [49,53,54]. Non-receptor tyrosine
kinase c-Abl is the key regulator of actin at many protrusive and adhesive cellular structures including focal adhesions [55]. Presence of c-Abl at podosomes or
invadopodia had not been studied yet. However, an indirect evidence connects its oncogenic BCR-fused variant

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/21

(BCR/Abl) to the promotion of podosome formation in
leukaemic cancer cells [56]. Recently mutant Abl kinase
variants have been associated with the promotion of
strongly invasive phenotype also in aggressive breast cancer cells [57]. Synaptopodin, which interacts also with
CD2AP, and localises to focal adhesions and foot processes of podocytes, had been implicated in cell migration
[58]. Transmembrane adhesion receptor Dystroglycan 1
had been recently found to modulate podosome formation in myoblasts [53]. Prominently, dystroglycan 1 regulates these cellular structures in complex with Tks5/FISH,
the specific component of invadopodia and podosomes
[49,59]. Although Tks5/FISH was not identified among
Ruk/CIN85 interaction candidates, in our samples we
found Tks4, recently discovered adaptor protein closely
related to Tks5/FISH [60].
Of particular interest, Tks4 and Tks5 are the only specific
regulators of invadopodia and podosomes identified so
far [59,60]. Recent study by Oikawa et al. [61] showed
that podosomes originate from focal adhesions via activation of Src kinase followed by accumulation of PI(3,4)P2,
targeting of Tks5 to podosome precursors and augmentation of Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly by N-WASP molecules recruited to Tks5 platform. Although this model is
too simplistic [60], it describes the sequential steps
required for the biogenesis of podosomes (and probably
also of invadopodia), including activation of Src, production of PI(3,4)P2 and promotion of Arp2/3-mediated
actin assembly by N-WASP. The most likely pathway of
PI(3,4)P2 production is through dephosphorylation of
PI(3,4,5)P3 produced sequentially by PI 3-kinase and
inositol-5'-phosphatases, including synaptojanins and
SHIP2 [61]. In addition, similarly to Tks5/FISH, Tks4
binds predominantly to PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2 [60]. Strikingly, through the different protein interaction modules
Ruk/CIN85 appears to be able to cluster all of these molecules, including PI 3-kinase [1], synaptojanins, SHIP2,
Tks4, and also N-WASP. Therefore, Tks4 and Ruk/CIN85
together are probably able to assemble a multimeric protein complex harbouring activities required to produce
PI(3,4)P2 (and hence stabilise Tks4 recruitment to membranes), as well as to regulate Cdc42 and promote Arp2/
3-mediated actin assembly. Such complex therefore
would fulfil all requirements for the successful initiation
of podosome formation in response to Src kinase activity.
Hence, although further experiments are obviously necessary, the existing data suggest that Ruk/CIN85 may control biogenesis of podosomes and invadopodia directly
via the augmentation of actin assembly. Noteworthy,
although it is not the general case for all cell models, the
strong association between Ruk/CIN85 and actin-rich
structures including focal adhesions had been found in
astrocytes [6]. Also, a recent study revealed the actin-bun-

dling properties of this adaptor [47]. At the same time,
Ruk/CIN85 might participate in vesicle-mediated transport associated with these cellular structures. This second
non-exclusive possibility is supported by the documented
roles of Ruk/CIN85 in membrane trafficking. In this
respect the involvement of Ruk/CIN85 in the Golgi-associated membrane trafficking is worth of particular attention because of the spatial relationship between Golgi
complex and invadopodia [48,49]. The notion that vesicle-mediated transport from the Golgi area to invadopodia might be important for the delivery of proteases and
other structural components to invadopodia is supported
by the observed polarisation of the Golgi complex
towards invadopodia, and the dependence of their ECMdegrading activities on the Golgi integrity [48,49].
If Ruk/CIN85 can indeed function both in membrane
trafficking and actin remodelling in the bifacial manner,
then the shifts of its attraction towards one of these processes in different cell types should be governed by certain
regulatory mechanisms. Due to the fact that the appearance of malignant and invasive cell phenotypes (including ability to generate invadopodia) often relies on de novo
re-wired signalling pathways [62], search for the pathologic subversions of such regulatory processes in invasive
cancer cells may contribute to better understanding of
how exactly Ruk/CIN85 is redirected to function in invadopodia biogenesis.
Ruk/CIN85 and other cellular processes
Except for the proteins participating in membrane and
actin remodelling, among the proteins recruited by the
SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 we distinguished two groups
of proteins with cellular functions, which had not been
associated with Ruk/CIN85 before. These included proteins related to cell cycle and cell division, as well as proteins involved in RNA/mRNA processing. Additionally,
the functional cluster associated with the cytoskeleton
organisation and biogenesis contained many proteins
with microtubule-related functions.

Although the participation of Ruk/CIN85 in remodelling
of actin cytoskeleton had been demonstrated in several
studies, current information on its potential role in organisation of microtubules is very limited. Therefore, it is of
interest that the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 recruit several proteins involved in the regulation of microtubule
dynamics. This primarily applies to GCP2, GCP3 and
GCP4 proteins which are the main components of large
and small γ-tubulin complexes (γTuSC and γTuRC)
responsible for the nucleation of microtubules at centrosomes and at other cellular structures [63]. Several lines of
evidence indicate that γ-tubulin complexes may participate in the non-centrosomal nucleation of microtubules
on membranous cellular compartments, including the

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/21

Golgi complex, and that it is required for the maintenance
of the Golgi structure [63]. Three other interaction candidates, LL5β, ELKS and CKAP4, have been implicated in
the attachment of microtubules to membranes [64,65].
Noteworthy, LL5β and ELKS act together to link microtubules with the cell cortex, focal adhesions and the plasma
membrane at the leading edge of motile cells [64].
Although our samples contained also several microtubule-binding proteins with undefined functions such as
DDA3, E-MAP-115 and Gar22 [66-68], in general it
appears that many of the Ruk/CIN85 interaction candidates are implicated in the regulation of microtubule
dynamics act at membranes. Thereby, the most straightforward explanation for our findings is that via the recruitment of such proteins Ruk/CIN85 may participate in the
regulation of microtubule dynamics at membrane compartments.
Similarly, in our study the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85
recruited the set of proteins involved in processing of
RNA/mRNA molecules. Majority of these proteins including SRm160, SRm300, Sam68, poly(A)-binding proteins
PABP1 and PABP4, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnRNPK and hnRNPC are involved in different
aspects of pre-mRNA splicing [69-72]. Importantly, similarly to Ruk/CIN85, some of these proteins had been functionally linked to the regulation of actin dynamics and
cell migration. For instance, hnRNPK had been implicated
in the direct interaction with and the regulation of NWASP at the cell periphery [73]. Of even more interest,
three of these proteins including hnRNPK, Sam68 and
PABP1 are present at focal adhesions, and PABP1 was
found to regulate cell spreading and migration through
the export of specific pre-mRNA molecules to these cellular structures [74,75].
Finally, many of the proteins recruited by the SH3
domains of Ruk/CIN85 identified here are known to be
involved in the regulation of cell cycle, and particularly of
cell division (cytokinesis). Four of these proteins, including anillin, MgcRacGAP, MKLP-1 and PRC1, constitute
the core machinery controlling formation and maintenance of the central spindle and the actomyosin contractile ring during cytokinesis [76-78]. In addition, the set of
identified cell division-associated proteins included both
subunits of microtubule-severing heterodimeric ATPase
katanin, several subunits of E3 ubiquitin ligase Anaphase
Promoting Complex (APC/Cylosome), microtubule-associated protein MAP4 and septins – GTP-binding proteins
able to assemble into highly dynamic filamentous structures associated with membranes, microtubules and actin
filaments [79]. While microtubule-severing activity of
katanin is required to control spindle length [80], APC/
Cyclosome is one of the principal regulators of cell cycle
progression responsible predominantly for final steps of

Proteome Science 2009, 7:21

mitosis and cytokinesis [81]. Anillin, MgcRacGAP and
PRC1 are all known substrates for APC/Cyclosome
[81,82]. In turn, septins are thought to co-operate with
MAP4 and Anillin in the regulation membrane organisation and vesicle trafficking at the cleavage furrow necessary for cytokinesis completion [83].
Although the function(s) of Ruk/CIN85 in cytokinesis is
(are) hard to envisage, its participation in this process is
feasible for several reasons. First, CD2AP/CMS, the close
homolog of Ruk/CIN85 (and its interaction partner), is
known to bind anillin and have been already implicated
in the regulation of cytokinesis [84]. Second, membrane
trafficking processes required for the addition of membranes to the cleavage furrow and to the midbody, as well
as vital for the completion of cell division utilise many
proteins normally involved in vesicle-mediated transport
of interphase cells [85]. These proteins include not only
dynamins but also another known Ruk/CIN85 interaction
partner AIP1/Alix [86,87]. And third, a recent study have
demonstrated the crucial role of the Golgi-associated
membrane trafficking and of the Golgi-derived vesicles in
this process [88].

Conclusion
Results of our study show complexity of protein interaction networks organised on the SH3 domains of Ruk/
CIN85 by identification of a number of proteins recruited
by the SH3 domains this adaptor. Many of them are
known to be involved in the regulation of membranes
and cytoskeletal structures required for vesicle-mediated
transport and cancer cell invasiveness. Our data support
the notion that Ruk/CIN85 regulates vesicle-mediated
transport and cancer cell invasiveness through the assembly of multimeric protein complexes governing coordinated remodelling of membranes and underlying
cytoskeletal structures, and imply important roles of this
adaptor in formation of coated vesicles and biogenesis of
invadopodia. Finally, our study points to potential
involvement of potential Ruk/CIN85 in other cellular
processes, in particular in cell division, and may indicate
directions for future research.

Methods
Plasmids and reagents
Plasmids for expression of the glutathione S-transferase
(GST)-fusion SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 in E. coli were
provided by Dr. Vladimir Buchman (Cardiff School of
Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom; see ref. [5] for
details).

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/21

CA). Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin was from
Promega (Madison, WI). 0.1% formic acid (FA) solutions
in water and acetonitrile (ACN) were acquired from
Mallinckrodt Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). All other reagents
were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Cell culture
Human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells obtained from
European Collection of Cell Cultures were grown in plastic plates at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM medium supplemented with GlutaMAX-I, 10% foetal bovine serum
(FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin
antibiotics.
Purification of GST-fusion proteins
E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, Madison, WI) transformed with the plasmids for
expression of the GST-fused SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85
or of GST alone were grown in LB medium with 1% glucose until OD600 = 0.6 and then expression of the proteins
was induced by 0.2 mM IPTG. After incubation for additional 2 hours at 25°C the bacterial cultures were harvested by centrifugation and purification of expressed
proteins was performed on Glutathione Sepharose 4B
according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham
Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden).
GST pull-down experiments
HeLa cells pre-washed twice with ice-cold PBS were harvested in the buffer of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM
NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and
Phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) and lysed for 30 min on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18000 g for 20 min at 4°C. To
remove proteins non-specifically binding to Glutathione
Sepharose 4B or to glutathione S-transferase, collected
supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with GST
alone bound to Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads for 2
hours at 4°C, and the beads were removed by centrifugation at 18000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Equal amounts of the
GST-fusion SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 or GST alone
bound to Glutathione Sepharose 4B (approximately 10 μg
of protein to 40 μl of beads per sample) equilibrated with
the same buffer were incubated for 4 hours at 4°C with
equal amounts of the pre-cleared lysate of HeLa cells. The
beads were washed five times in the buffer containing 20
mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then boiled in SDS-loading buffer.

Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
Glutathione Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Biosciences AB (Uppsala, Sweden). 10% Tris-HCl Ready Gel
precast gels were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules,

Sample preparation and protein identification by LC-MS/
MS
The samples obtained in the pull-down experiments were
separated on SDS-PAGE in 10% Tris-HCl precast gels and
visualised by Coomassie R-250 staining. After the electrophoretic separation of samples, equal pieces were cut
from experiment (GST-fusion SH3 domains) and control
(GST alone) gel lanes as indicated in Additional file 1.

Prior to the analysis excised gel slices were subjected to the
standard procedure of in-gel trypsin digestion, during
which proteins were reduced with 100 mM DTT for 30
min at 56°C, alkylated with iodoacetamide in darkness
for 45 min at room temperature, and digested overnight
with 10 ng/ul trypsin. Peptides were eluted from gel with
the water solution of 0.1% FA and 2% ACN. The resulting
peptide mixtures were applied to RP-18 pre-column
(Waters, Milford, MA) using water containing 0.1% FA as
a mobile phase and then transferred to a nano-HPLC RP18 column (internal diameter 75 μM, Waters, Milford
MA) using ACN gradient (0 – 30% ACN in 45 min) in the
presence of 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The column outlet was coupled directly to the ion source of LTQ
FTICR mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San
Jose, CA) working in the regime of data-dependent MS to
MS/MS switch. A blank run ensuring absence of cross-contamination from previous samples preceded each analysis.
Analysis of mass spectrometry data
After pre-processing the raw data with Mascot Distiller
software (version 2.1.1, Matrix Science, London, UK),
obtained peak lists were used to search the non-redundant
protein database of the National Centre for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) version 20070428 (4874565
sequences, 192489 human sequences) using the Mascot
search engine (version 2.2, 8-processors onsite license)
(Matrix Science, London, UK) with the following search
parameters: taxonomy restriction – Homo sapiens
(human), enzyme specificity – semi-trypsin, permitted
number of missed cleavages – 1, fixed modification – carbamidomethylation (C), variable modifications – carbamidomethylation (K) and oxidation (M), protein mass
– unrestricted, peptide mass tolerance – ± 40 ppm, fragment mass tolerance – ± 0.8 Da, max missed cleavages –
1. The searches were restricted to Homo sapiens sequences
because HeLa cells used in our experiments originated
from the human. Only proteins for which at least two
peptides with Mascot cut-off scores ≥ 48, indicating identity or extensive homology of peptide (p ≤ 0.05), were
considered as the positive identifications.

http://www.proteomesci.com/content/7/1/21

binding to GST or Glutathione Sepharose 4B. Protein hits
scoring as the positive identifications in the controls were
in all cases removed from the lists, even if the corresponding hits from the experiment samples matched larger
number of peptides. For the protein hits matching two or
more database entries (e.g. several protein isoforms or
products of a same gene carrying single amino acid substitutions) accession number of the best annotated entry
were listed in Table 1, all other accession numbers were
reported in Additional file 2. Partial protein sequences
without N-terminal methionine, derived e.g. from the
conceptual translation of partial mRNA sequences were in
all cases excluded from the analysis. Additional file 2
includes also long and alternative names, as well as accession numbers of proteins in UniProt Knowledgebase
Release 14.0 (22 July 2008).
Analysis of protein modular architectures
Analysis of modular architectures of the identified proteins was performed by querying their sequences against
InterPro version 19.0 database using InterProScan software [89]http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan and
by searches in Ensembl release 52 database http://
www.ensembl.org. The short names of the modules found
in the identified proteins were listed in Table 1, for the
long names refer to Additional file 3.
Scansite analysis
Presence of potential recognition consensus sites for the
SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 in protein sequences was
analysed using Scansite version 2.0 software [90]http://
scansite.mit.edu. Scansite matrices for the SH3 domains
of Ruk/CIN85 (see Additional file 5) were constructed in
accordance with the guidelines provided by software
developers. For the construction of each matrix, we used
the experimental data on consensus peptide composition
obtained previously by Kurakin et al. [2] through targetassisted iterative screening (TAIS) of bacteriophage-displayed random peptide libraries. In brief, the arginine residue (R) flanking peptide ligand core sequence recognised
by all the SH3 domains of Ruk/CIN85 (PX(P/A)XXR) was
selected as the invariant fixed position residue in the
matrices. Matrix scores for different amino acids in each
position within ligand binding core were calculated from
their frequencies in the peptides selected by TAIS. Very
low score values (0.1) were applied to allow for the presence of alternative amino acid residues in non-critical
(second, fourth and fifth) positions within the ligand
binding core. The analysis was performed on the protein
sequences corresponding to the entries listed in the Table
1.

The resulting protein lists for the experiment (GST-fusion
SH3 domains) samples were compared with the control
(GST alone) lists to exclude proteins non-specifically

Functional annotation clustering and association network
analyses
Analysis of functional enrichment within the identified
proteins was performed in DAVID 2.0 software [17]http:/
/david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov according to the standard protocol
[91]. Functional annotation clustering tool was used to
avoid the occurrence of highly related or redundant terms
in the results. The combined list of official gene symbols
corresponding to the identified proteins was used for
input (see Additional file 6). Association network analysis
was performed by STRING 8.0 software [18]http://
string.embl.de with the following analysis parameters:
species – Homo sapiens, confidence level – 0.200, active
prediction methods – all, and using combined list of
Ensembl gene IDs for input (see Additional file 6). The
resulting protein association network was visualised in
Cytoscape 2.6.1 software [92]. The functional annotations
were mapped onto the network using the same software.
