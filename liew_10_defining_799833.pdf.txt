Defining species specific genome differences in
malaria parasites
Kingsley JL Liew, Guangan Hu, Zbynek Bozdech, Preiser R Peter*

Abstract
Background: In recent years a number of genome sequences for different plasmodium species have become
available. This has allowed the identification of numerous conserved genes across the different species and has
significantly enhanced our understanding of parasite biology. In contrast little is known about species specific
differences between the different genomes partly due to the lower sequence coverage and therefore relatively
poor annotation of some of the draft genomes particularly the rodent malarias parasite species.
Results: To improve the current annotation and gene identification status of the draft genomes of P. berghei,
P. chabaudi and P. yoelii, we performed genome-wide comparisons between these three species. Through analyses
via comparative genome hybridizations using a newly designed pan-rodent array as well as in depth bioinformatics
analysis, we were able to improve on the coverage of the draft rodent parasite genomes by detecting orthologous
genes between these related rodent parasite species. More than 1,000 orthologs for P. yoelii were now newly
associated with a P. falciparum gene. In addition to extending the current core gene set for all plasmodium species
this analysis also for the first time identifies a relatively small number of genes that are unique to the primate
malaria parasites while a larger gene set is uniquely conserved amongst the rodent malaria parasites.
Conclusions: These findings allow a more thorough investigation of the genes that are important for host
specificity in malaria.

Background
Malaria is a disease caused by the parasitic protozoa
from the genus Plasmodium. While the disease is
restricted to the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the
world due mainly to the natural habitat of the mosquito
vector, these regions are densely populated with almost
2.2 billion people living in endemic areas and 515 million cases were expected per annum [1]. Although wellestablished culture and molecular techniques have been
established for Plasmodium falciparum, the use of
rodent malaria parasites as in vivo models in the study
of the host-parasite interactions is still as relevant today
because the rodent parasites are very similar to the
human and primate parasites in terms of life cycle, physiology and structure [2].
Since the release of the genome sequences of P. falciparum and the rodent malaria species, common features
of these haploid genomes include a genome size of 22* Correspondence: prpreiser@ntu.edu.sg

Technological University, 60 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637551, Singapore

26 Mb that are arranged in 14 chromosomes ranging
from 0.5-3.0 Mb. In addition the current genomic data
show a high degree of conservation between different
Plasmodium species with the exception of genes located
in the telomeric and subtelomeric regions that are extremely variable due to their role in antigenic variation and
immune evasion [3,4]. This suggests that genes located
close to the centromeres of the chromosomes would be
highly conserved. As a proof of concept, comparisons of
these centrally located genes between P. falciparum and
the most completely annotated rodent parasite species
P. yoelii was shown to have a high degree of synteny [5].
Thus, conservation of these common ‘core’ genes even
amongst divergent species was demonstrated and differences were mainly due to chromosomal re-arrangements
[3,4].
In contrast, the chromosomal regions responsible for
antigenic variation and host immune evasion show the
most divergence. The genome of P. falciparum contains
species-specific subtelomeric genes involved in host cell
invasion, adhesion and antigenic variation that are not

found in the P. yoelii genome. For example, the P. falciparum genes that are located in the sub-telomeric
regions include the var, stevors and rifins that are
responsible for antigenic variation and hence immune
evasion [6,7]. In contrast, the P. yoelii yir gene family
seems to be the largest multigene family found in the
sub-telomeric regions and is absent in P. falciparum.
Interestingly, this multigene family is common to all the
rodent species and to P. vivax [8]. A more recent study
employing probabilistic modelling in conjunction with
genomic organization and protein structure analysis
bridges this gap and places the P. falciparum rjf/stevor
multigene family together into a conserved multigene
superfamily of malaria parasites known as the Plasmodium interspersed repeats (PIRs) [9]. This discovery
further suggests that although genes are more conserved
than previously thought; there is evidence of speciesspecific divergence that is dependent on each species’
interaction with the host or host immune system. A
recent phylogenetic survey of rodent malaria parasites
based on DNA sequences from multiple loci in the
nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid genomes placed P.
berghei and P. yoelii as sister species forming a distinct
clade while P. chabaudi and another rodent parasite P.
vinckei forming another group [10] thus suggesting that
P. berghei and P. yoelii seemed to be more evolutionarily
related to each other while P. chabaudi appeared to be a
more distinct line. While these studies address gene
conservation among different species as well as confirm
species-specific sequence polymorphisms a global quantitative comparisons with regards to gain or loss of gene
function have not been attempted due to the incomplete
genome sequences of the malaria parasite species, barring the high resolution map of P. falciparum [11]. As a
consequence, differences between the rodent parasites
especially at the genomic level have not been fully elucidated as yet and thus linking genomic differences to
phenotypic traits of these parasites have been difficult.
In order to address this issue, genome-wide comparisons
including comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
and detailed bioinformatics analysis can be employed as
a valuable tool to identify similarities and differences
between related species. This technique has been utilized to compare genomic differences between similar
species in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. For example, CGH has been used to genotype related yeast species to determine the presence and absence/
polymorphic sequences [12]. The usefulness of CGH in
gene discovery was shown with the discovery of three
thousand novel genes in Klebsiella pneuomoniae 342
using microarray hybridization with Escherichia coli K12 open reading frames with confirmation of the presence of genes coding for conserved metabolic functions
and demonstrating specificity where genes obtained via

Page 2 of 14

lateral transfer in K-12 were absent in 342 [13]. In addition, CGH is also able to differentiate genome-wide variation in various virulent and avirulent Burkholderia
species [14]. Besides analyzing sequence variation, the
gain/loss of DNA can also be used as a tool for elucidating evolutionary divergence between species in their natural environment.
The means for such analysis lies in the use of DNA
microarray technology based on the ‘spotting’ of long
oligonucleotides onto glass slides [15-17]. Although the
techniques employed for performing DNA microarray
experiments have been well established, improvements
in the algorithms used for designing the array probes
have been critical for advancing the reproducibility and
accuracy of detecting the respective gene targets.
Recently, a novel robust program called ‘OligoRankPick’
was able to optimize oligonucleotide design by optimizing target specificity and GC% variation. This algorithm
is based on a weighted rank-sum strategy to optimize
oligonucleotide selection even along genomes of many
diverse organisms [18]. The resultant P. falciparum
dataset generated from this strategy was shown to be
highly reproducible and also led to increased coverage
of the P. falciparum genome as compared to earlier
P. falciparum microarray designs. Although the incompleteness of these rodent parasite genomes could present difficulties in their comparative analysis, there is
some evidence that they are highly conserved [5]. We
have thus emulated the ‘OligoRankPick’ strategy to
design a pan-rodent cross-genome oligonucleotide
microarray for the rodent malaria species P. berghei, P.
chabaudi and P. yoelii. Due to the incompleteness of
the genome sequence available for all three rodent genomes the microarray design approach resulted in oligonucleotide sequences predicted to be complementary to
all three rodent species, two rodent malaria species or
to be unique to a single species. Comparative genomic
hybridization using genomic DNA from each of the
three species not only validated the oligonucleotides but
at the same time provided new information that allowed
the closure of sequence gaps in the genomes of one or
more of the rodent species based on complementary
hybridization data, thereby significantly improving our
overall understanding of gene content for each species.
While the CGH approach proofed exceptionally powerful it was still likely that due to sequence polymorphisms found in the different species at the
oligonucleotide probe region genes that are actually present would be missed using this strategy alone. For this
reason the current available genome sequences were
reanalyzed using bioinformatics tools to detect any additional genes missed by the microarray approach alone.
Finally, a random selection of genes predicted from the
microarray and bioinformatics data to now be present in

Liew et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:128
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/128

all rodent genome species was validated using PCR and
sequencing.
Overall this multipronged approach allowed us to significantly improve the gene predictions for all three
rodent malaria species. In addition the new information
obtained in this study allows the assembly of an
improved core set of genes present in all plasmodium
species while at the same time also identifying a rodent
malaria specific gene set.

Results
Key design features of the ‘Pan-rodent’ array chip

In order to detect genes from all three rodent malaria
parasite (RMP) species, the DNA microarray design was
based on the ‘OligoRankPick’ program [18] as this algorithm was shown to have significant improvements over
other strategies even when dealing with large fluctuations in GC content and abundant gene duplications.
Since the microarray designed here was to include all
available information for three RMP species, there are
key challenges and modifications to our original program so as to accommodate multiple genomes on a single microarray. Since P. yoelii is the only RMP with a
published draft genome [3], we first designed oligonucleotides against the predicted P. yoelii gene models.
Next, all possible oligonucleotides of P. yoelii were used
to query the homologous regions of the other two RMP
species (Figure 1A). Next, four parameters were used to
select for the best oligonucleotide, namely: BLAST
scores (first and second hit), GC content, sequence
complexity and self-annealing scores (Figure 1B). Each
score is then transformed into a rank and a weighted
rank-sum is calculated for each oligonucleotide with the
final oligonucleotide being selected based on the smallest rank-sum value. These oligonucleotides were then
selected to be optimal for all three species, followed by
oligonucleotides for P. yoelii and P. berghei and then for
P. yoelii and P. chabaudi (Figure 1A). For the remaining
predicted open reading frames oligonucleotides specific
for each species were then designed. A total of 14,736
oligonucleotides were thus obtained and the breakdown
is shown in Figure 2.
Comparative Genomic Hybridization using the Pan-rodent
microarray

Since some of the oligonucleotides are designed to be
capable of cross hybridizing with more than one species,
we have re-sorted all the genes from the three species
and matched them with their respective oligonucleotides
so that an accurate normalized value can be obtained
for analysis. Using this approach, we performed comparative genomic hybridization experiments and first
looked at the performance of the species-specific oligonucleotides that were designed to hybridize with their

Page 3 of 14

target genome. After normalizing and filtering the data
the percentage of successful oligonucleotides for P. yoelii-specific, P. berghei-specific and P. chabaudi-specific
oligonucleotides were 91% (7,347), 90% (6,314) and 84%
(6,356) respectively. It is not surprising that a low proportion of oligonucleotides were unable to hybridize
with their intended targets especially if they were
designed in regions with low confidence in sequence
quality. A likely reason is the relatively poor genome
coverage of the rodent parasite genomes as compared to
the more complete P. falciparum genome. Also, there
are errors in the current sequence drafts of the rodent
malaria parasites due to the propensity of random
sequence rearrangements of an AT-rich genome in a
sequencing vector.
Using the validated set of oligonucleotides, we identified all the oligonucleotides that hybridized to the DNA
of parasites they had not originally been designed
against (Figure 2). A positive hybridization signal provides strong evidence that the sequences and therefore
the genes represented by these oligonucleotides are also
present in the genomes of the other rodent parasite species. This strongly implies that the respective genes that
are represented by these oligonucleotides are actually
present but are not found in the current database.
Filling the gaps in the genomes of the rodent malaria
parasite species

Since it has been established that the malaria parasite
genomes are well conserved [5], it is conceivable that
genes that are missing in the current draft of either of
the RMP genome have a well conserved ortholog in one
or two of the other species. Using the pan-rodent
microarray we wish to investigate this possibility by
inspecting comparative genome hybridization (CGH)
signals on “cross-species” oligonucleotide microarray
elements. For example high signal from P. yoelii gDNA
for an oligonucleotide that is not designed to hybridize
to P. yoelii implies that this gene (sequence) is present
in P. yoelii. In summary, a species where the draft genome currently does not possess a particular gene but
now gives a signal on the array suggests the presence of
this orthologous gene. Hence, this gene can thus be
detected based on homology.
Missing genes in the draft genome could arise due to
two scenarios: either the sequence information is missing, or that the sequence is present in the genome but
missed by current gene prediction algorithms. Since the
oligonucleotides were designed based on predicted open
reading frames, a CGH signal constitutes direct experimental evidence for the presence of an orthologous
genomic sequence and thus potentially the gene in the
RMP genome in which this gene is missing. Based on
this approach, we detect 179, 306 and 215 genes missing

Figure 1 The overall design schematics of the pan-rodent chip. (A) Methodology of the chip design. Firstly, all possible oligonucleotides of
P. yoelii were used to search in the homologous region of the other two species using NCBI blastn and were scored and ranked accordingly.
The oligonucleotides were then filtered using three rules such they must have: (i) at least 90% homology to target sequences, (ii) less than
37.5% to non-target sequences and (iii) GC% tolerance of ± 5%. Oligonucleotides for all three species were selected followed by
oligonucleotides for P. yoelii and P. berghei and then for P. yoelii and P. chabaudi. Next, the remaining oligonucleotides were selected to be
specific for both P. berghei and P. chabaudi. The remaining sequences unaccounted for were then used to design oligonucleotides specific either
to P. yoelii, P. berghei or P. chabaudi. (B) Rank-sum strategy. Oligonucleotides were scored accordingly to (i) first and second BLAST hits, (ii) GC
content (Tm) and (iii) Smith-Waterman score (self-binding). The oligonucleotides are then ranked based on each parameter and ordinal rank
number is given to all oligonucleotides in each parameter rank independently. The final weighted rank-sum (RS) is calculated for all
oligonucleotides using multiple weight sets (not indicated) and the lowest value is considered. Finally, the optimal candidate is selected based
on the lowest RS(k) amongst all oligonucleotides in the locus of interest [18]

in the current draft sequences of the P. yoelii, the P. berghei and the P. chabaudi genome, respectively. The
majority of these genes code for hypothetical proteins
that lack any functional assignment based on their
amino acid sequence. For those whose function has
been described, genes involved in biosynthesis, protein
modifications, kinases and also invasion-related proteins
in the case of P. chabaudi and P. berghei have been discovered (Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S1).
A selection of genes that were detected via the microarray data were randomly selected for polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) screening (Figure 3) and direct

sequencing in order to establish the confidence of this
group of newly discovered genes. PCR primer pairs were
designed flanking the oligonucleotide sequence to the
species where there is known sequence information and
these were used to amplify a newly predicted gene in
another species where it is not annotated/predicted or
where the sequence is absent. All screens were performed on regions where sequence information for the
newly discovered orthologous genes is not present (i.e.
missing sequence) except for PY00632 and PY03414
where a corresponding P. berghei contig is present but
the gene is not predicted. In summary, 7 of the 8 PCR

long and the GC content is targeted at 30% and the allowable deviation is 5% for overlapping oligonucleotides. Complementary
oligonucleotides to each rodent malaria parasite species was calculated from the sum of all possible combinations, i.e. oligonucleotides specific

reactions gave a product around the predicted size and
the one sample that was PCR negative could be due to
sequence polymorphisms at the primer sites. Sequence
analysis of the PCR product confirmed that the PCR
product did indeed represent the predicted gene (data
not shown). Some PCR products also exhibit a change
in the predicted size, for example different PCR product
sizes of PY00632 and its P. berghei ortholog are
expected based on the currently available sequence
information. Differences in PCR product size are due to
variations in sequence length in the region bounded by
the primers. The differences in PCR product size in the
PY06972 screen of P. yoelii and P. chabaudi genomes
are also due to the same reason. The high congruence

of PCR-positive screens showed the power of the array
in detecting homologous sequences currently absent
from the available genome sequences of the other species. Additional microarray investigations pertaining to
the detection and validation of polymorphic genes and
differential transcription profiles between related parasite clones have further validated the performance of the
oligonucleotide probes (unpublished).
Cross-species gene identification using bioinformatics

Although a total of 700 novel orthologous rodent parasite genes have been discovered via the array approach,
these revisions still leave significant gaps in the genomes
of the three rodent parasite species. Therefore in

addition to CGH, we also utilize bioinformatics to look
at the genome in its entirety so as to probe for open
reading frames that have been missed by the automated
gene predictions provided by the RMP sequencing projects. The use of bioinformatics tools to query non-coding regions of the rodent malaria parasite genomes can
be useful in detecting genes that have been missed by
automated gene prediction algorithms. The more complete P. falciparum amino acid sequences were used to
query the rodent malaria parasite genomes as a
tBLASTn search using an expect value of at least 10-15
as a cut-off threshold. While this approach does not
account for synteny, evidence that regulation of transcription of individual genes occurred independently
without any constraints on chromosomal location
further supports this approach [19,20]. In addition, multigene families would be collapsed, as conserved
domains would link such members together. Using this
approach, 103 orthologous genes were discovered in

P. berghei, 93 in P. chabaudi and 286 in P. yoelii. This
data also suggests that while the P. yoelii genome is
more completely assembled, it is lacking a number of
predicted open reading frames. Similarly, PCR screens
of these predicted genes were performed in order to
obtain additional confidence for the bioinformatics
derived dataset. For this confirmation, two groups were
selected based on whether a homologous contig for a
particular species is present in a region where a gene is
not predicted, thereby checking if this gene is truly
deleted from this locus or is still present, being either
translocated to another locus or missed by the automated contig assembly (Figure 4). On another hand, we
have observed another scenario where a newly discovered orthologous gene is not present in the species of
interest. While sequence information is absent for these
candidate genes, the adjacent genes are present in separate contigs. We thus wanted to screen these gaps or
assembly errors that have excluded this gene (Figure 5).

The re-annotated P. chabaudi gene orthologous to
PFF1480w, PB000730.00.0 and PY03519 was screened
twice as the best-fit P. chabaudi contig only contains
the 5’-end sequence of this gene while the 3’-end is
missing. Based on the random sampling approach (Figure 4), the PFI0535w-PB104921.00.0 pair seems to be
exclusively found in P. berghei and not in the other 2
RMP species. For the PF14 0473-PC0001359.02.0 pair, it
seems that this gene is also present in P. berghei while
the MAL13P1.345-PY04218 pair looks to be also present
in P. berghei as well. As for the other three pairs of
genes
(PFL0595c-PB301230.00.0¬PC000699.01.0;
PFF1480w(3’end)-PB000730.00.0-PY03519; PF13_0131¬
PC000708.04.0-PY04599) that seem to be missing in
either one of the three RMP species, PCR screening suggests otherwise and that they are indeed common to all
three RMP species. These results suggest that rodent
parasite genes that are seemingly absent on a contig are

likely to be present with high confidence in all three
rodent malaria parasite species. Almost all of the other
panel’s screenings (Figure 5) showed that all of those
genes were present in the three RMP species barring the
P. chabaudi exclusive gene (PFL2450c-PC000344.03.0)
that seemed to be present also in P. berghei but seemingly not in P. yoelii. This suggests with high confidence that the missing genes due to incomplete
sequence information are present. Overall, it seems that
it is highly likely that missing genes due to poor sequencing coverage are present and genes common to two
rodent malaria parasite species are very likely to be present in all three species.
Defining the core Plasmodium genome

With the more complete coverage of the rodent malaria
parasite genomes obtained via the analysis here, we now
thought to define a common ‘core’ Plasmodium genome

where orthologous genes present in all sequenced
malaria parasites was defined. Plasmodium falciparum,
being the most completely annotated and researched
malaria parasite genome, is used as an index reference
species in an attempt to consolidate genes common to
as many species as possible. For each P. falciparum gene
the orthologs present in the rodent parasite species were
matched, and the resulting dataset was further appended
with the respective orthologs from another human
malaria parasite P. vivax and the simian parasite P.
knowlesi as these genomes had been recently sequenced
to 10× and 8× [21,22] coverage respectively. This
approach segregated P. falciparum genes into two
groups: firstly, the ‘core’ genes containing orthologs to
the rodent parasite as well as the P. vivax and P. knowlesi sequences (Additional file 2: Supplemental Table S2)
and secondly, genes that have no significant alignment

with rodent sequences (Additional file 3: Supplemental
Table S3). While orthologous genes (with respect to P.
falciparum) are highly conserved in regions where
housekeeping genes predominate, the telomeric and
sub-telomeric regions (i.e. non-syntenic) contain genes
involved in antigenic variation that are more divergent
[3] and this is consistent with the observation that the
group representing the non-orthologous genes is dominated by var, stevor and rifin gene families that are
involved in antigenic variation. What is immediately
apparent is the high similarity of all six parasite species
in the regions that contain housekeeping genes. In total,
4,188 genes were common between P. falciparum and
the rodent parasites. Of these, 73 genes, mainly
hypothetical genes, were absent in both P. vivax and P.
knowlesi. In addition, 50 genes were present in P. vivax
but not in P. knowlesi and 79 genes were present in

Gene clusters of orthologous genes across six malaria parasite species, namely P. falciparum (Pf), P. berghei (Pb), P. chabaudi (Pc), P. yoelii (Py), P. knowlesi (Pk) and
P. vivax (Pv). More genes are common to all six species where evidence of rodent malaria parasite (RMP) chromosome matching to P. falciparum syntenic regions
is present.

P. knowlesi but not in P. vivax. Without these speciesspecific genes, we found 3,986 genes that are common
to all six species.
An additional 387 P. falciparum genes (conserved in
the two primate malaria parasites) appear to be missing
in one or two of the rodent malaria parasite species
(Table 1) with the vast majority of these representing
hypothetical genes. The main exception represents genes
conserved between P. falciparum, P. berghei and P. yoelii
but missing in P. chabaudi from which approximately
30% have a functional annotation. Of the 387 genes, only
a relatively small number (27-40) are exclusively found in
only P. falciparum and one of the rodent malaria species
with a significantly large number (92-96) being present in
two species. While the genes missing in one or two
rodent species could potentially represent species specific
gene deletions, the fact that a significant number of these
(72%-96%) orthologs are also present in the more divergent P. knowlesi and P. vivax genomes are highly suggestive that the respective rodent orthologs that have not yet
been identified by either the sequencing project or the
analysis reported here could likely be present.
On the other hand we identify 927 P. falciparum
genes without a match to any rodent parasite species,
469 were composed of hypothetical genes (Table 2),

Gene clusters of orthologous genes across six malaria parasite species, namely
P. falciparum (Pf), P. berghei (Pb), P. chabaudi (Pc), P. yoelii (Py), P. knowlesi (Pk)
and P. vivax (Pv). In contrast to genes found in syntenic regions (Table 1)
significantly less genes are common in P. falciparum species specific coding
regions.

with the majority of known genes being made up of the
var, rif and stevor multigene families that are present at
the subtelomeric regions of essentially all P. falciparum
chromosomes (Additional file 3: supplemental table S3).
Only about 14% of the 927 genes were conserved in P.
vivax and/or P. knowlesi, with 117 being present in both
species. While all genes exclusive to P. falciparum and
P. knowlesi represent hypothetical genes, 6 genes specific
to P. falciparum and P. vivax encode proteins involved
in parasite invasion; 2 cysteine proteases and 4 MSP7like genes. Taken together we define 4,188 genes that
form a core gene set for a Plasmodium genus. From this
set only a small fraction of genes (27 to 96 ~ 0.6%-2.2%)
is lost in one or two of the six Plasmodium species. In
contrast there are a large number of genes that appear
specific to individual Plasmodium species and conserved
only in one or two others. These mainly involve gene
associated with host parasite interaction and are localized in the subtelomeric regions. However, limited
diversification was also observed in genes present in the
intrachromosomal region mainly involved in other Plasmodium specific functions such as invasion.
Defining the core rodent Plasmodium genome

Using a similar approach as in the previous section, we
attempt to construct a rodent parasite specific associative table since we can also take advantage of the dataset
from the genomic hybridizations. For this purpose,
instead of using genes from P. falciparum as an index,
the oligonucleotides were chosen as the index and then
replaced with the best-hit P. yoelii gene. Next, P. falciparum - P. yoelii, P. berghei - P. yoelii and P. chabaudi P. yoelii orthologs were appended to the list. This strategy creates a database of genes orthologous to P. yoelii
and the reason for choosing this species as the index is
due to it being more completely annotated than the
other two rodent parasite species. This list was refined
by removing matching orthologs from P. falciparum
that were already present in the common ‘core’ set;
thereby creating a filtered list that contains only genes
that are specific to the rodent malaria parasites.

Microarray data and bioinformatics (tBLASTn) to query
the P. yoelii amino acid sequences were also employed.
In order to reduce the complexity of the dataset, the
PIRs, which consist of the largest multigene family and
dominate the rodent specific genes, will not be discussed
due to their variability of expression and gene expansion
amongst the rodent malaria parasites due to its main
role in antigenic variation [23,24] as well as its copy
number being the most abundant in P. yoelii. Consequently, the huge reduction in genes common in all
three rodent malaria parasite species is due to the
removal of the PIR genes that could also confound relationships based on bioinformatics simply due to multiple matching of common conserved domains
(Additional file 4: Supplemental Table S4; Figure 6).
Overall this approach now identified 1,238 genes that
are common to all rodent malaria species most of which
(1,013) represent hypothetical genes. Importantly only
about 8% of these predicted genes have ORF that are
shorter than 100 nucleotides making it less likely that
these are annotation or prediction errors but indeed
represent functional genes. Taking together these gene
numbers along with the 4,188 genes found in the ‘core’
set, the total number of conserved rodent malaria genes

Page 10 of 14

is 5,426. In addition it appears that there are 210 genes
specific to P. yoelii and P. chabaudi (Additional file 5:
Supplemental Table S5), 247 genes specific to P. yoelii
and P. berghei (Additional file 6: Supplemental Table
S6) and 453 unique to P. yoelii (Additional file 7: Supplemental Table S7) with most of them (> 90%) again
representing hypothetical genes. Of the 453 unique
P. yoelii genes 45% are less then 100 nucleotide in
length, compared to 24% in the P. yoelii and P. berghei
group and 17% in the P. yoelii and P. chabaudi group
indicating that a number of these genes represent false
gene models.

Discussion
Our microarray specific to the rodent malaria species
P. berghei, P. chabaudi and P. yoelii has provided a
golden opportunity to verify the genomes of these
rodent malaria parasite (RMP) species. The RMP draft
genomes were annotated similarly where GlimmerMExon was first trained on P. falciparum data and automated assignments were based on hidden Markov
model association [3,25]. Since these genomes were
annotated in a similar manner, we do not foresee any
annotation bias in the three RMP draft genomes. Our

reduction occurs in the group Py-Pb-Pc in which all the three rodent malaria parasite species share a common gene. (Legend: Py = genes

oligonucleotide selection process aims to include every
predicted gene model and the robustness of the design
algorithm has been shown in the ability to differentiate
between members of large multigene families [18]. Evidence of significant homology via hybridization and
bioinformatics show that a high proportion of these
gene models are conserved amongst the three RMP species, therefore suggesting that a high proportion represent true gene models that are refractory to random
mutations as compared to intronic sequences.
The definition of the core gene set of Plasmodia genes
using the most completely annotated genome of P. falciparum as a reference index has enabled the use of direct
hybridization and bioinformatics tools to expand the
repertoire of common genes. The validity of utilizing
CGH and bioinformatics to improve genome annotation
is well established [12-14,26]. Novel gene models discovered via hybridization have been validated with PCR
(Figure 3) while genes discovered via both hybridization
and bioinformatics were also validated (Figures 4 and 5).
In fact, PCR screens of a subset of genes without at
least one RMP ortholog suggest that there is high confidence that any P. falciparum gene that contains at least
an ortholog from one of the RMP species can potentially
contain orthologs from all three RMP species. This suggests that the high stringency thresholds in both hybridization and bioinformatics are in fact conservative and
there are potentially more genes that have yet to be discovered. Hence, the results indicate that the genetic
repertoires of the RMP species are indeed more common and that these genes should be present in the
poorly assembled and annotated rodent parasite
genomes.
The construction of a rodent specific orthology map
using P. yoelii as the reference index was undertaken to
study and survey rodent parasite specific genes that are
distinct from the common ‘core’ set. Although this process would filter off genes specific to the other two
RMP species, the P. yoelii genome was chosen as it is
the most completely annotated rodent parasite genome
while the gene set in P. chabaudi is over-predicted thus
making comparisons across species difficult. This associative table clearly demonstrates certain species-specific
metabolic differences and reveals gene duplications and
expansions from both the core set of Plasmodia genes
and the rodent parasite specific genes. Similarly, hybridization data reveals more orthologous genes than the
current known set.
Due to the high AT-bias in the genome of the Plasmodia species, sequencing the entire genome, joining
overlapping sequences to form contigs and gene predictions have been difficult. While the majority of the
rodent malaria parasite genes have been sequenced and
annotated, many gaps still remain and the data from the

Page 11 of 14

pan-rodent cross-genome oligonucleotide microarray
provides direct experimental evidence for this case.
While the genomes from P. berghei and P. chabaudi
continues to be refined at the Sanger Institute, improvements on the sequence coverage of the P. yoelii genome
has not been taken up by any group. Therefore, any
improvements in genome coverage for P. yoelii would
be extremely valuable.
More importantly, the total number of orthologous
gene pairs obtained in this survey (Table 3) is now significantly higher than the published dataset [25] except
for the P. berghei and P. chabaudi orthologous gene
pair where they have been over-predicted. The total
number of ortholgous pairs is calculated by the sum of
the core genes together with the remaining P. falciparum - RMP gene permutations as well as any RMP
specific genes. For example, for the P. yoelii vs. P. falciparum orthologous gene pair, the sum is 4,188 (core PfRMP) + 37 (Pf-Py) + 97 (Pf-Pb-Py) + 92 (Pf-Pc-Py) =
4,414. PCR screening also strongly suggests that a P. falciparum gene with at least a single RMP ortholog is also
likely to contain orthologs from all three RMP species.
Since these genes total up to 4,578, the potential maximum of orthologous genes will be computed using this
assumption where the 4,188 core genes are replaced by
the theoretical maximum of 4,578 genes. This work augments and complements the recent manual re-annotation of P. yoelii genes [26] and the release of the dataset
presented here is intended to provide a reference
resource for researchers working on the in vivo rodent
malaria species model, especially where predicted orthologs are currently unavailable. Data from both the core

Summary table of orthologs between P. falciparum and the three rodent
parasite species. The ‘core’ set represent orthologs common in all four species
defined via hybridization and bioinformatics information. Other gene set
combinations were taken from the remaining permutations of genes
generated from those with at least 2 RMP orthologs as well as the rodent
parasite specific genes. The total number of orthologous pairs is the sum of
the core genes with the other respective gene permutations while the current
set denotes the status quo [25]. The potential total indicates the theoretical
maximum of common genes as there is strong suggestion that a P. falciparum
gene with at least one RMP ortholog can potentially be orthologous to all
three RMP species.

and rodent species specific gene datasets can now form
the basis for investigating the differences in host cell
selectivity and other pathophysiological traits such as
sequestration observed between the different RMP. It is
not surprising that the majority of the rodent species
specific genes have no known function but by now having identified a relatively small number of genes, a more
thorough investigation to qualitatively associate specific
genes with species specific traits is feasible. On the
other hand this study does not exclude that differences
in the expression of conserved genes also contributes to
species specific differences.
Our approach here provides a significant improvement
of gene coverage using existing information and wellestablished experimental and analysis techniques. The
additional information provided here will be of particular use for future efforts using next-generation DNA
sequencing technologies.

Conclusions
Unlike most previous studies that have focused on finding similarities between the genomes of different plasmodium species [3,5,21,22,25] the work here for the
first time attempts to define the difference in gene content between the different parasites. Currently, our
understanding on the genetic basis for species specific
restriction of malaria parasites is limited. This is mainly
due to the incomplete status of the RMP genomes that
do not allow reasonable assessment of their nuclear
encoded proteomes. Conducting the cross species CGH
and the reciprocal homology searches allowed us to generate substantially improved dataset that enables us for
the first time to investigate the subsets of genes that
may be involved in Plasmodium speciation. First, we
identify 117 genes that are found in only the human
and primate malaria species should be considered key
candidates for separating rodent from primate malarias.
Similarly the 1,238 RMP specific genes are likely to provide the biological framework that separates the rodent
from primate malaria. How these mainly hypothetical
genes function in the parasite biology now needs to be
further investigated.
In contrast to the relatively large numbers of genes
that are unique to individual species (e.g. 927 gene
unique to P. falciparum) or species subgoups (e.g. 1,238
specific to RMP), there is only a small number of genes
that are lost from the generic core gene set 27 to 96
genes lost in one or two Plasmodium sp.). With the
rodent parasites forming a distinct phylogenetic clade
and genetic evidence that P. vivax and P. knowlesi are
more similar to each other [27,28] this suggests that
species specific gene expansion and diversification is the
main driving force of speciation amongst Plasmodium
species. This is likely to apply to genes responsible for

Page 12 of 14

invasion and antigenic variation, but also genes involved
in other species specific phenotypes such as the asynchronous character of the intra-erythrocytic development of P. yoelii, the formation of hypnozoites in P.
vivax and the propensity of sequestration.

Methods
Microarray fabrication

A modification of the ‘OligoRankPick’ program [18] was
employed to design 60-mer probes to the three rodent
parasite species P. berghei, P. chabaudi and P. yoelii
(Additional file 8: Supplemental Table S8; Additional file
9 - Supplementary Table S9) using sequences deposited
in PlasmoDB http://www.plasmodb.org. Cross-species
oligonucleotides were selected based on the criteria as
described in the results section, i.e. at least 90% homology to the target sequence, less that 37.5% to non-target
sequences and capped with a 5% difference tolerance in
GC content. All possible oligonucleotides for a particular gene was then ranked and sorted based on target
(>90%) and non-target hit (<37.5%), GC content (±5%)
and the best Smith-Waterman score (Figure 1). Hence,
all possible oligonucleotides were evaluated based on
every available gene model and the best sequence was
then selected. Oligonucleotides were spotted onto polyL-lysine-coated microscopic glass slides [15].
Rodent parasite DNA preparation for genomic DNA
microarray

Balb/c mice were used as vertebrate hosts for the propagation of P. berghei ANKA, P. chabaudi AS and P. yoelii
17 × 1.1. All procedures were in accordance with the
guidelines for the use of experimental animals established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Nanyang Technological
University of Singapore. Leukocytes were filtered from
whole blood [29] and gDNA extracted using the EasyDNA™ kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For each parasite line, 3 μg of DNA was mixed
with 2.5 μg of random nanomer primer to a volume of
15.25 μl. DNA was denatured at 100°C for 5 min and
snap cooled on ice for 5 min. Labeled DNA was generated by adding dNTPs to a final concentration of 1 mM
dATP and 500 fM each: dCTP, dGTP, dTTP and 5-(3aminoallyl)¬2’-deoxyuridine-5’-triophosphate, (aa-dUTP)
(Biotium), with 20 units of exo-Klenow Fragment (New
England Biolabs) in a total volume of 50 μl and incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then overnight at 37°C. Cy-dye coupling, cleanup, hybridization,
washing and slide scanning were performed as described
by Bozdech and co-workers [15]. Experiments were performed with at least duplicates for each species Subsequently, the data were normalized using the NOMAD
microarray database http://ucsf-nomad.sourceforge.net/.

Liew et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:128
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/128

For the comparative genome analysis, low quality features and features with a signal level less than two-fold
of the background plus two-fold of the background
standard deviation was filtered from the initial raw data
set.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

Verification of genes was performed via PCR thermocycling (Eppendorf) using the following conditions: 1 cycle
of 95°C for 2 min; followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 1
min, 50°C for 1 min and 68°C for 30 s. A final extension
was set for 10 min at 68°C and then the tubes were kept
at 4°C. For each 20 μl reaction, 2 ng of DNA was used
as a template with 10 pmol of the forward and reverse
primers (Additional file 10: Supplemental Table S10),
200 μM of dNTPs with 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Kapa Biosystems).
Bioinformatics tools

The sequences of P. falciparum, P. knowlesi and P. vivax
were obtained from PlasmoDB http://www.plasmodb.
org. For any gene missing an orthologous partner in
another species even after complementation with the
array data, known orthologs were appended using the
resource available at PlasmoDB (version 5.5). Unannotated genes were identified using the tBLASTn search
where amino acid sequences from a well-annotated species (PlasmoDB version 5.5) are used to query the genome of another species. A threshold of 10-15 was used
to ensure the stringency of locating matching genes.
