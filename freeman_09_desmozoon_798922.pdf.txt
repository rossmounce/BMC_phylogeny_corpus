Abstract
Background: A microsporidian was previously reported to infect the crustacean parasite,
Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer, 1837) (Copepoda, Caligidae), on farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo
salar L.) in Scotland. The microsporidian was shown to be a novel species with a molecular
phylogenetic relationship to Nucleospora (Enterocytozoonidae), but the original report did not
assign it to a genus or species. Further studies examined the development of the microsporidian in
L. salmonis using electron microscopy and re-evaluated the molecular findings using new sequence
data available for the group. Here we report a full description for the microsporidian and assign it
to a new genus and species.
Results: The microsporidian infects subcuticular cells that lie on the innermost region of the
epidermal tissue layer beneath the cuticle and along the internal haemocoelic divisions. The mature
spores are sub-spherical with a single nucleus and an isofilar polar filament with 5-8 turns in a
double coil. The entire development is in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm and is
polysporous. During early merogony, a diplokaryotic nuclear arrangement exists which is absent
throughout the rest of the developmental cycle. Large merogonial plasmodia form which divide to
form single uninucleate sporonts. Sporogonial plasmodia were not observed; instead, binucleate
sporonts divide to form two sporoblasts. Prior to final division, there is a precocious development
of the polar filament extrusion apparatus which is associated with large electron lucent inclusions
(ELIs). Analyses of DNA sequences reveal that the microsporidian is robustly supported in a clade
with other members of the Enterocytozoonidae and confirms a close phylogenetic relationship
with Nucleospora.
Conclusion: The ultrastructural findings of the precocious development of the polar filament and
the presence of ELIs are consistent with those of the Enterocytozoonidae. However, the confirmed
presence of an early diplokaryotic stage and a merogonial plasmodium that divides to yield
uninucleate sporonts instead of transforming into a sporogonial syncitium, are features not
currently associated with the family. Yet, analyses of DNA sequence data clearly place the
microsporidian within the Enterocytozoonidae. Therefore, due to the novelty of the copepod host,
the ultrastructural findings and the robust nature of the phylogenetic analyses, a new genus should
be created within the Enterocytozoonide; Desmozoon lepeophtherii n. gen. n. sp. is proposed.

Background
Microsporidia infect a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, and are common parasites of both fish and
arthropods. Reports of microsporidian infections in
marine and freshwater crustacea are also numerous and
include various microsporidian genera infecting marine
crabs [1-4], brine shrimp [5], cladocerans [6,7], ostracods
[8], marine shrimps [9-14], amphipods [15], freshwater
crayfish [16], marine lobster [17] and copepods [18-22].
Although nine genera and approximately 50 species of
microsporidia have been described from copepods
[18,20,22], none have been described from free-living
marine copepods. However, there are two reports of
microsporidia as hyperparasites of parasitic marine copepods. An unidentified microsporidian, phylogenetically
related to Nucleospora spp. (Enterocytozoonidae), has
been reported to infect the caligid copepod Lepeophtheirus
salmonis parasitic on farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar
[21,23], and Unikaryon mytilicolae (Durfort, Vallmitjana &
Vivares, 1980) has been found infecting the cyclopoid
copepod Mytilicola intestinalis (Steuer, 1902) on marine
mussels [24]. A single report also exists for the hyperparasitic microsporidian, Microsporidium lamproglenae, infecting the freshwater copepod Lamproglena pulchella (von
Nordmann, 1832) parasitic on the cyprinid fish, Leuciscus
leuciscus L. in Europe [25].
The majority of microsporidians described from free-living freshwater copepods have complex life cycles utilising
copepods as intermediate hosts and mosquito larvae as
definitive hosts [26-28]. The life cycles of the microsporidians infecting parasitic marine copepods are not fully
known. However, the hyperparasitic microsporidian
infecting L. salmonis was shown experimentally not to
transmit directly from copepod to copepod. Furthermore,
the microsporidian DNA was isolated from internal tissues from the fish host, suggesting that the Atlantic
salmon may be involved in the life cycle [23].
The microsporidian hyperparasite from L. salmonis was
placed in the Enterocytozoonidae by Freeman et al. [21]
based on the results of robust phylogenetic analyses, but
they did not assign it to a genus. At that time, only two
genera existed in the Enterocytozoonidae. Enterocytozoon,
containing a single species, Enterocytozoon bieneusi
(Desportes, 1985), an intestinal parasite of humans and
other mammals [29,30] and now known to be comprised
of numerous genotypes infecting a wide range of mammals and birds [31]. The second genus, Nucleospora, is
comprised of intranuclear microsporidians infecting fish
[32-34]. The microsporidian from L. salmonis could not be
placed in either the Enterocytozoon or the Nucleospora as the
host species was too dissimilar and it was neither an intranuclear microsporidian nor one infecting intestinal ente-

rocytes. In addition, the small round to sub-spherical
spores of the microsporidian from L. salmonis, measuring
2.34 × 1.83 μm (± 0.01 μm), developing without sporophorous vesicles and forming large xenomas (up to 300
μm in diameter) in the sea lice hosts were sufficiently
unique features to enable it to be distinguished from all
previously described microsporidia from copepods in
freshwater as well as microsporidia infecting other marine
crustacea [21].
Since Freeman et al. [21] assigned the microsporidian
from L. salmonis to the family Enterocytozoonidae, a new
genus, Enterospora, has been created in the family for intranuclear microsporidia infecting the hepatopancreatocytes
of marine decapods [4] and a new species Enterocytozoon
hepatopenaei, only the second species in the genus, has
been described from the cytoplasm of the tubule epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas in the black tiger shrimp
Penaeus monodon (Fabricius, 1798) from Thailand [14].
Thus, the Enterocytozoonidae currently contains three
genera: Enterocytozoon spp. that infect the cell cytoplasm of
mammalian and bird enterocytes and tubule epithelial
cells of the hepatopancreas in the black tiger shrimp,
Nucleospora spp. that infect the nucleus of various fish cells
and Enterospora spp. that infect the nucleus of hepatopancreatocytes in marine decapods.
In the present study we examine the ultrastructure of the
microsporidian infecting L. salmonis from farmed Atlantic
salmon and provide an updated molecular phylogenetic
analysis. Using the combined data we describe Desmozoon
lepeophtherii n. gen. n. sp., and place it in the Enterocytozoonidae as a fourth genus of the family.

Methods
Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, were collected from
salmon farms on the West Coast of Scotland. Adult lice
were carefully removed using forceps from recently culled
fish during routine harvests. Specimens were transferred
from the farm site to the laboratory in bags of seawater at
ambient temperature and salinity. Once in the laboratory,
specimens were maintained in seawater collected from the
farm site, aerated at 10°C in 10 L aquaria. Daily removal
of senescent and dead lice with 80% water change allowed
the remaining lice to survive without their hosts for several days.
Lice were screened for the presence of microsporidian
infection using a dissecting microscope. Lice with inclusions under the carapace were dissected and fresh squash
preparation observed to confirm the presence of microsporidian spores using a compound microscope. Confirmed infected lice were dissected further as required and
fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 hours, washed in
cacodylate rinse buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.2) overnight. Sam-

ples were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (in 1%
borax solution) for one hour, before dehydration through
a graded acetone series. After dehydration to 100% acetone, the samples were transferred to a 1:1 mix of Spurr
resin [35] and acetone for 1 hr on a rotator followed by a
further 2 hr in a mix of 3:1 Spurr: acetone. Finally, the
specimens were rotated for 24 hr in 100% Spurr resin
before being embedded in Beem capsules and polymerised at 60°C for 48 hrs.
All sections were cut using a glass knife on a Reichert
Ultracut E ultramicrotome. Semi-thin sections of 1 μm
were first cut and visualised by staining with 1% alcian
blue for 5 min and examined under light microscopy.
Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were mounted on 200 mesh
Formvar coated copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Ultrathin sections were examined
with a Philips 301 TEM operating at 80 kV. Photographs
were taken with a flat plate camera using black and white
Kodak 4489 EM film.
Whole infected lice were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
fractured whilst under nitrogen, by applying pressure to
the carapace with a scalpel. Fractured lice were then fixed
at 4°C for one hour in 1% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer. This initial fixation was followed by a 23 day immersion in 3% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer at 4°C, followed by an over night rinse
in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Samples were then post-fixed
in 1% osmium tetroxide (in 1% borax solution) for 2 hrs,
before dehydration through a graded ethanol series. Once
in 100% ethanol, samples were transferred to a 50:50 mix
of ethanol and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) for 30 min
before being transfered to 100% HMDS for a further 30
min. Samples were air-dried at room temperature over
night, mounted on aluminium stubs and coated with gold
at 40 mA for 90s using an Edwards S150B Sputter Coater.
Samples were examined using a Philips 500 scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV. Photographs were
taken using an integral camera with Ilford FP4-125 film.
Representative small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU
rDNA) sequences from the Enterocytozoonidae were used
in order to view the relatedness of genera and species
within the family. Sequences used are available in GenBank under the following accession numbers: Desmozoon
lepeophtherii AJ431366; Enterocytozoon bieneusi L07123;

AF185989; Nucleospora salmonis AF186006; Nucleospora
sp. AF186007; Microsporidium sp. AF394528; Microsporidium sp. FJ794872. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX
[36] and percentage divergence matrices constructed

Results
Fresh wet-mount preparations from dissected L. salmonis
with inclusions under the carapace revealed the presence
of numerous microsporidian-like spores. A definitive
identification of microsporidian spores was confirmed
with TEM of the infected lice. Mature spores are subspherical (round to ovoid), with a single nucleus and a
thickened electron lucent endospore wall measuring
between 150-250 nm thick surrounded by a thinner electron dense exospore measuring between 35-40 nm thick
(Fig. 1a-b). The polar filament has between 5 and 8 turns,
normally in a double coil, and is of the isofilar type, being
of a similar diameter (65-85 nm) along its entire length.
The mature spore has typical features of a microsporidian
spore. The polar filament is attached at the anterior end of
the spore via the anchoring disc, which is surrounded by
the laminar structure of the polaroplast; the posterior vacuole is located at the opposite end of the spore.
SEM of freeze-fractured L. salmonis revealed large xenomas
developing under the cuticle (Fig. 2a). The cellular surface
of the epidermal layer adjacent to the cuticle is smooth
and uninfected, whilst the inner most sub-cuticular epidermal region adjoining the haemocoel that contains the
xenoma, has a coarse and pitted appearance (Fig. 2a). A
semi-thin abdominal histological section shows xenomas
forming from the innermost surface of the epidermal layer
beneath the cuticle and also from the structures separating
the haemal sinuses in the haemocoel (Fig. 2b). The cells
in this region consist mainly of desmocytes, fibrocytes
and tissue-dwelling haemocytes. The exact host cell type
was undistunguishable owing to the changes effected during xenoma formation. However, the microsporidian
appears to infect cells that are associated with a glycocalyx-like border on the innermost part of the epidermal
layer bordering the haemocoel and along haemocoelic
divisions between sinuses. TEM confirms that infection
was not observed throughout the epidermal layer and is
restricted to the innermost surface (Fig. 3a).
Occasional host cell remnants could be seen in large xenomas but smaller xenomas contained multiple nuclei,

nuclear fragments or multi-lobed nuclei (Fig. 3b); the
microsporidian was never observed to have a close association with the host cell nucleus or seen as intranuclear at
any stage of development. The microsporidian remained
in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm throughout
the developmental cycle and did not form a complete
interfacial envelope of either parasite-derived or hostderived origin that contained a typical number of spores.
Figure 3c is an early meront and is the earliest microsporidian stage that was observed. The nucleus is in a
diplokaryotic arrangement and the cytoplasm is electron
lucent lacking other cellular organelles. The diplokaryotic
nuclei of the early meronts divide to produce two
diplokaryotic nuclei which locate at opposing cellular
borders (Fig 3d). Cytokinesis follows this nuclear division
and the cell divides by binary fission, producing two new
meronts each with a diplokaryon (Fig 3d); during this
division the cytoplasm has a much more granular appearance. The diplokaryotic nuclear arrangement was not
observed after this point in the developmental phase and
nuclear dissociation is assumed to have occurred. Nuclear
dissociation is followed by multiple subsequent nuclear
divisions, which are not directly linked to cytokinetic
events, resulting in the formation of a large, paucinucleate, rounded, merogonial plasmodium, which ultimately
divides by plasmotomy (Fig 3e). During division, the
plasmodium contains very granular cytoplasm with no
obvious organisation of organelles and the nuclei have
electron-dense laminate bodies lying on the nuclear membrane, indicative of recent nuclear activity from either
nuclear dissociation or recent division (Fig 3f).
The resulting uninuculeate stages represent the production of sporonts and the onset of sporogony. Sporonts
have a higher degree of cellular organisation than
meronts. Early sporonts have a precocious development
of the polar filament which is associated with the nucleus
and a complex of cytoplasmic cisternae that coalesce to
form the polar filament bundles; there is a modest thickening of the plasmalemma prior to division (Fig 4a). Dur-

ing sporogony the polar filament and its attachment
apparatus, the anchoring disc, continue to develop and
the plasma membrane continues to thicken (Fig 4b). The
early formation of the anchoring disc is often seen to take
place in association with a nuclear invagination (Fig 4b).
During these preliminary stages of sporogony, numerous
tubules are present in the host cell cytoplasm (Figs 4a-4c).
The coils of the polar filament continue to mature with an
electron dense core forming and membrane bound electron lucent inclusions appear in the posterior part of the
spore between the developing bundles of polar filament
(Fig 4c). These stages are considered to be sporoblasts that
continue to develop into spores without further division.
As the sporoblasts mature, the polar filament continues to
become more electron-dense and show concentric patterns of electron density (inset Fig 4d). The ELIs become
more prominent and are often associated with large electron dense particles located at the membrane (Fig 4d).
Occasionally, sporoblast-like forms at a similar developmental stage retain two sets of polar filaments (Fig 4e).
Immature spores start to reveal typical microsporidian
spore-like features (Fig 4f). The exospore is fully formed
before the endospore develops and the ELIs are now associated with the developing posterior vacuole. At this stage
a fragile interfacial envelope can sometimes be seen surrounding the immature spore (Fig 4f).
Membranous-like secretions were sometimes observed in
the host cell cytoplasm during sporogony (Fig 5a-c). These
secretions between 30-40 nm in thickness contained a
central core of electron dense particles and appeared to
develop at the external surface of maturing spores. The
membranous-like secretions were occasionally seen free
in the host cell cytoplasm as enclosed concentric membranous whorls (Fig 5c).
Host cell nuclei of microsporidian-infected cells were
sometimes observed with intranuclear inclusions, which
were of a crystalline appearance having a regular pattern
(Figs 5d).

From the percentage divergence matrices (Table 1), D.
lepeophtherii is most similar to members of the Nucleospora, ranging from 10.0-11.8% divergence over approximately 850 bases of SSU sequence data; Enterocytozoon
spp. are more distant at 18.3-20.2% divergence. Percentage divergence within the Nucleospora was as high as
14.1% between species infecting non-salmonids (English
sole and Atlantic halibut) and as low as 0.3% between salmonid species. Percentage divergence between the two
species of Enterocytozoon ranged from 13.7-20.2% depending on the genotype of E. bieneusi, and 1.5% between the
two genotypes examined. Desmozoon lepeophtherii is most
similar to the Nucleospora sp. infecting English sole with
10.0% divergence over 847 bases of the SSU examined
The phylogenetic tree (Fig 6) confirms that the results
obtained with percentage divergence matrices were also
observed using maximum parsimony analyses. Desmozoon
lepeophtherii forms a well-supported clade with the Nucleospora sp. infecting English sole which forms as a sister
group to the N. salmonis clade. The bootstrap support for
these clades is 100%. Enterocytozoon spp. are more basal in
the tree and E. hepatopenaei does not group with the E.
bieneusi genotypes, but forms a solitary branch between E.
bieneusi and the Nucleospora clade containing Desmozoon.
The outgroup Microsporidium sp. (DP), is a microsporidian that infects the intestinal wall of Daphnia, is related to
other Daphnia-infecting species such as Microsporidium sp.
clone B [7], and has been shown to be immediately basal
to the family Enterocytozoonidae in independent phylogenetic analyses [6,21].

Discussion
Tissue location of Desmozoon lepeophtherii in L. salmonis
The epidermal layer in copepods is described as a flattened cellular layer containing a great number of membrane-bound vesicles and mitochondria, with a very

complicated spatial arrangement [39]. This complex
arrangement of cells was confirmed to be similar in L. salmonis in the present study (Fig 3a). The basal portion of
the epidermal layer rests on a glycocalyx [39], which is
also referred to as the basal lamina and functions as a
basement membrane separating the epidermal layer from
the underlying tissues and haemocoel [40]. The glycocalyx
contains epidermal cells such as modified epithelial cells
with tonofilaments, desmocytes or fibrocytes and tissue
dwelling haemocytes [39]. Microsporidian xenomas
develop from this location, but due to the extreme hypertrophy and transformation of infected host cells due to
xenoma formation, their identity can only be hypothesised from our current knowledge. We believe that infection is primarily in the desmocytes, as infection is also
seen along the haemocoelic divisions that have little or no
such epidermal tissue layer. However, it is also possible
that phagocytic haemocytes become infected, or are
involved with the spread of the infection throughout the
copepod, or are responsible for the initial transportation
of spores from the portal of entry to the site of infection.
Xenoma formation has not been reported for other members of the Enterocytozoonidae.
Comparative ultrastructural features of Desmozoon and
the Enterocytozoonidae (Table 2)
The diplokaryotic arrangement of nuclei seen in early
merogony in D. lepeophtherii is not seen in the other genera from the Enterocytozoonidae, although it was
reported in the initial description of E. bieneusi by
Desportes et al., [29]. This early diplokaryotic nuclear formation in E. bieneusi was later rejected by Cali and Owen
[41] who suggested it was an artifact caused by the flattening of the nuclei by adjacent ELIs. An early plasmodial
stage of Enterospora sp. has been observed with 'paired
nuclei' [3] but the nuclear arrangement does not appear to
be typical of a microsporidian diplokaryon. The lack of

complete descriptions of early merogonial stages for some
members of the Enterocytozoonidae means that a brief or
early diplokaryotic stage in the merogonial development
cycle should not be completely ruled out for other members of the family.
All members of the Enterocytozoonidae share certain
developmental features. Whilst early merogonial stages
have not always been well characterized and remain
somewhat contentious, all currently described species
develop large sporogonial syncitia in which the polar filament extrusion apparatus forms and develops prior to

eventual division to sporoblasts. This precocious development of the polar filament, prior to final division and its
association with ELIs in large sporogonial plasmodia, are
features that are unique to this family of microsporidia. In
the three genera of the family: Enterocytozoon, Nucleospora
and Enterospora, the sporogonial plasmodium develops
directly from the merogonial plasmodium without division and continues to mature to form the characteristic
sporogonial syncitium. This direct transformation is
assumed to occur as no division of the multinucleated
merogonial stages have been reported for these taxa, only

their development and subsequent maturation to sporogonial forms.
Syncitial masses, such as merogonial and sporogonial
plasmodia, are large proliferative stages that can occupy a
significant proportion of the microsporidian-infected cell,
which would make it unlikely for them to be missed during TEM examination of ultrathin sections of infected
material. Therefore, it must be concluded that D. lepeophtherii develops without the formation of the sporogonial
plasmodium that is typical for the family Enterocytozoonidae. Instead, the merogonial plasmodium divides to
form uninucleate sporonts, which undergo a number of
nuclear divisions, all of which are followed by cellular
division, resulting in a final division to form two sporoblasts. The lack of the formation of the characteristic sporogonial plasmodium in Desmozoon might be considered
sufficiently different for it not to be included in the Enterocytozoonidae. However, a precocious development of
the polar filament can be found in young divisional sporonts (Fig 4a) and two sets of fully formed extrusion apparatus are sometimes found in large sporoblasts that are
presumably yet to divide (Fig 4e). ELIs are also present
throughout much of the developmental cycle in Desmozoon, being at their largest during late sporont and early
sporoblast formation and reduced or absent in mature
spores. Cali and Owen [41] suggested that the ELIs
observed in E. bieneusi were storage vacuoles and probably

involved in the formation of the polar filament and other
spore structures. The ELIs in Desmozoon develop in close
association with cytoplasmic cisternae and the developing
polar filament (Fig 4c) supporting this hypothesis. They
are also associated with the formation of the posterior vacuole, as they are positioned posteriorly in the developing
spore ultimately where the posterior vacuole develops
(Fig 4f). The presence of ELIs in Desmozoon during sporogony and the early development of the polar filament seen
as early as young divisional sporonts are typical features of
the Enterocytozoonidae that are seen in all the described
species of the family and suggest that this microsporidian
should be placed in the Enterocytozoonidae in spite of the
lack of a sporogonial plasmodium.
Although some characteristics are present in all family
members, there can be notable differences in the cellular
processes involved in their formation. Morphogenesis of
the polar filaments proceeds differently in the three
described genera of the Enterocytozoonidae. In E. bieneusi
a large electron dense body associated with vesiculotubular networks form electron dense disc-like structures
(EDDs), which appear throughout the plasmodium and
then fuse into arcs forming the polar filament coils
[33,41]. In Nucleospora spp. the polar filament does not
coalesce from EDDs but from cylinders or tubular structures that are associated with ribosome rich cytoplasm
delimited by the ER cisternae [32,33]. In Enterospora, mul-

Molecular phylogenetics of the Enterocytozoonidae
Desmozoon lepeophtherii has been shown to be robustly
supported as a member of the Enterocytozoonidae using
phylogenetic analyses [[21], present study]. The Enterocytozoonidae form a small monophyletic group that is part
of a larger clade described as being terrestrial in origin, but
having evolved from ancestral freshwater microsporidians
[42].

tiple spherical membrane-bound vesicles are present
throughout the cytoplasm of the plasmodium [4], which
presumably correspond to polar filament precursors and
are similar to those seen in E. bieneusi although not as
electron dense. The development of the polar filament in
D. lepeophtherii is more similar to that of Nucleospora spp.
as no typical EDDs develop and the polar filament develops within the cytoplasmic cisternae of ER (Fig 4a). However, the early assembly of the polar filament does not
take place in the plasmodium as the merogonial plasmodium divides to form sporonts before being transformed
to a sporogonial syncitium in this species.
Mature spores of D. lepeophtherii share many characteristics with those in the Enterocytozoonidae (Table 2). All
members of the family have small round to ovoid (subspherical) spores, a single nucleus and between 4-8 turns
of an isofilar polar filament, usually in a double coil, are
polysporous and lack a complete interfacial envelope at
all developmental stages.

The Enterocytozoonidae has recently increased its size
with respect to the number of genera and described species it contains. However, all the new descriptions are
from aquatic marine crustacean hosts [3,4,14], including
that in the present study. Unfortunately there are no DNA
sequences available for the genus Enterospora infecting
marine crabs, but ultrastructural descriptions adequately
placed them in the Enterocytozoonidae. The increasing
occurrence of microsporidia infecting crustacea in the
Enterocytozoonidae is not unexpected, as a related gutinfecting microsporidian from Daphnia has been shown
to be consistently placed as basal to the group [6,21].
Unfortunately no ultrastructural data is available for this
parasite, but a similar microsporidian has been recently
further documented from Daphnia populations in European lakes [7]. As more species are described and more
gene sequences become available for the Enterocytozoonidae, some of these unresolved phylogenetic issues will
hopefully be clarified. But, current phylogenetic analyses
suggest that the Enterocytozoonidae is likely to have
evolved from a common ancestor infecting a crustacean
host. The phylogenetic importance of crustacean-infecting
microsporidia in understanding the origins of species like
Enterocytozoon bieneusi that infect humans may be significant.
Other ultrastructural features of Desmozoon
lepeophtherii in Lepeophtheirus salmonis
Numerous appendages/tubules were observed in the host
cell cytoplasm during sporogony (Fig 4a-c). Takvorian
and Cali [43] reviewed the form and function of microsporidian appendages, suggesting four different types. The
appendages observed in this study most closely resemble
the type I tubules described from Glugea stephani (Hagenmüller, 1899), but, during the present study, evidence that
the tubules were continuous with the parasite plasmalemma was not apparent. The function of these appendages
remains unknown but they have been suggested to facilitate host-parasite interchange of materials [43]. Microsporidian tubules have not been reported in the
Enterocytozoonidae previously. They are rare amongst
microsporidia that develop in direct contact with the host
cell cytoplasm, but developing stages of both E. bieneusi
and E. hepatopenaei have been observed with numerous
tubule-like cytoplasmic projections extending into the
host cell cytoplasm [14,33]. The lack of distinct cytoplas-

mic tubules in other members of the Enterocytozoonidae
may be due to the common features of their sporogony
resulting in the presence of sporogonial syncitia in all
cases. The microsporidian tubules in D. lepeophtherii are
only associated with sporogony and are more prominent
during early sporogony, particularly in divisional young
sporonts which are absent in other members of the family. Furthermore, microsporidian tubules have never been
reported for intranuclear microsporidians. Tubule formation is not typically associated with xenoma-forming
microsporidia and is more often observed in species that
develop complete interfacial envelopes [44].
The microsporidian infection in L. salmonis does indeed
complete its developmental cycle lacking any type of complete interfacial envelope. However, during late sporogony there were membranous secretions regularly observed
near the outer surface of sporoblasts, occasionally in multiple layers (Fig 5a-b). These are thought to be parasitederived secretions as no host cell remnants were associated with them. These membranous secretions were never
seen to completely isolate the sporoblast from the host
cell cytoplasm and hence cannot be considered an interfacial envelope. The structures were also observed as continuous concentric circular membranous whorls, whose
function was not apparent (Fig 5c). These membranous
secretions are possibly partially formed parasite derived
interfacial envelopes or associated with or derived from
the cytoplasmic tubules present during early sporogony.

Similar non-persistent parasite derived interfacial envelopes have been reported from Vairimorpha necatrix
(Kramer, 1965) where envelopes are formed during sporogony, which only sometimes develop to fully enclose
the sporoblasts [44]. Similar membranous structures,
described as type IV cytoplasmic tubules, have also been
observed in sporophorous vesicles during sporogony in V.
necatrix [44,45].
The intranuclear inclusions observed in infected host cells
had an appearance consistent with either crystalline inclusions or viral like particles VLPs [46] (Fig 5d). Microsporidian infections have previously been associated with
simultaneous viral infections. Both Nucleospora and Enterocytozoon have been reported to be associated with retroviral infection of their hosts. Nucleospora salmonis has been
found in fish infected with the retrovirus that is believed
to be the cause of plasmacytoid leukaemia [47,48], and E.
bieneusi is found predominately in HIV-infected patients,
although this is largely accepted as opportunistic infections due to a lowering of the immune status caused by
the viral infection [49]. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic
crystalline inclusions are frequently associated with other
cell abnormalities such as tumour cells and leukaemic
conditions; intranuclear crystalline and paracrystalline
inclusions have also been regularly associated with virally
infected cells [46]. The VLPs seen in the present study are
not thought to be related to the microsporidian infection
but could warrant further study.

Taxonomic summary
Phylum: Microsporidia (Balbiani, 1882)

Class: Microsporea (Levine & Corliss, 1963)
Order: Microsporida (Balbiani, 1882)
Family: Enterocytozoonidae (Cali & Owen, 1990)
Specific diagnosis
Spores are round to sub-spherical, with an isofilar polar
filament with 5-8 turns in a double layer. Entire development is in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm.
Large xenomas develop from the glycocalyx border that is
immediately basal to the epidermal tissue layer beneath
the cuticle, and desmocytes are thought to be the most
likely host cell infected. Early diplokaryotic meronts
develop into large plasmodia, with unpaired nuclei that
divide by plasmotomy to form sporonts. During sporogony there is a precocious development of the polar filament extrusion apparatus which is associated with
electron lucent inclusions. The polar filament can be fully
arranged and well developed prior to the final division to
form two sporoblasts. SSU rDNA sequence data is most
similar to members of the Nucleospora and its position is
robustly supported within the Enterocytozoonidae.

nucleate sporonts has not been observed in the Enterocytozoonidae before. However, the typical family traits of
the precocious development of the polar filament and the
presence of ELIs were consistently observed, albeit in sporonts instead of a sporogonial plasmodium. Phylogenetic
analyses consistently and robustly place Desmozoon
lepeophtherii with other members of the Enterocytozoonidae as a monophyletic group, supporting the ultrastructural findings. This study highlights the importance of
supplying a SSU rDNA sequence when describing new
species of microsporidia. It is increasingly apparent that
certain ultrastructural features, such as the diplokaryotic
arrangement of nuclei can be lost or gained very rapidly
over evolutionary time [42] and, following such characters leads to unacceptable polyphyletic groupings defined
by character states that have evolved separately on numerous occasions and are not derived from a common ancestor [42]. Therefore the use of gene sequences to infer
phylogenetic relatedness is extremely valuable and is vital
for resolving the higher taxonomic issues in the microsporidia.
These results of this study lead us to the conclusion that
the microsporidian hyperparasite of L. salmonis should be
included in the Enterocytozoonidae. But, due to the
unique ultrastructural features observed, xenoma formation, the novelty of the parasitic copepod host and the
10% sequence divergence seen in the SSU rDNA to its
closest relative, that a new genus should be erected; the
name Desmozoon lepeophtherii n. gen. n. sp. is proposed.
