Abstract
Background: Pregnant women acquire protective antibodies that cross-react with geographically diverse placental
Plasmodium falciparum isolates, suggesting that surface molecules expressed on infected erythrocytes by pregnancyassociated malaria (PAM) parasites have conserved epitopes and, that designing a PAM vaccine may be envisaged.
VAR2CSA is the main candidate for a pregnancy malaria vaccine, but vaccine development may be complicated by its
sequence polymorphism.
Methods: The dynamics of P. falciparum genotypes during pregnancy in 32 women in relation to VAR2CSA
polymorphism and immunity was determined. The polymorphism of the msp2 gene and five microsatellites was
analysed in consecutive parasite isolates, and the DBL5ε + Interdomain 5 (Id5) part of the var2csa gene of the
corresponding samples was cloned and sequenced to measure variation.
Results: In primigravidae, the multiplicity of infection in the placenta was associated with occurrence of low birth
weight babies. Some parasite genotypes were able to persist over several weeks and, still be present in the placenta at
delivery particularly when the host anti-VAR2CSA antibody level was low. Comparison of diversity among genotyping
markers confirmed that some PAM parasites may harbour more than one var2csa gene copy in their genome.
Conclusions: Host immunity to VAR2CSA influences the parasite dynamics during pregnancy, suggesting that the
acquisition of protective immunity requires pre-exposure to a limited number of parasite variants. Presence of highly
conserved residues in surface-exposed areas of the VAR2CSA immunodominant DBL5ε domain, suggest its potential in
inducing antibodies with broad reactivity.
Background
In sub-Saharan Africa, 25 million pregnant women are at
risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection every year[1,2].
Plasmodium falciparum isolates infecting pregnant
women are special in that parasites are able to sequester
in vivo in the intervillous space and bind in vitro to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) [3,4]. This placental accumulation of infected red blood cells (IRBCs) is associated with
the low birth weight of the newborn [5].
The parasite ligand involved in this interaction between
the IRBCs and CSA is a specific PfEMP1 variant named
VAR2CSA [6-8]. Serum samples from exposed pregnant
women specifically recognize CSA-binding infected
erythrocytes, independently of their geographic origin

and are able to inhibit binding to CSA in vitro. This suggests that the antigenic targets specifying placental parasites must be relatively conserved [9,10]. Protection
against pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is rapidly
acquired and is associated to high level of anti-VAR2CSA
antibodies. Thus, in areas of high Plasmodium transmission, primigravid women lack those antibodies and are
the most at risk of developing severe consequences of
PAM [11-16].
All this highlights the key role that VAR2CSA plays in
the mechanism of PAM and the acquisition of protective
immunity and clearly opens an excellent opportunity for
the development of a vaccine against PAM [17]. However,
the problem of polymorphism accounting for 10-30%
variation between the different clinical isolates [18,19]
represents a great challenge for designing a VAR2CSAbased vaccine.

In a previous work, molecular analysis of VAR2CSA
DBL3X sequence of placental isolates had suggested that
distinct parasite variants preferentially infect pregnant
women according to their parity status [20]. Among the 6
VAR2CSA DBL domains, antibodies raised against
DBL3X and DBL5ε recombinant proteins are the most
likely to cross-react with heterologous parasites including
placental isolates from Tanzania [21,22] Moreover, previous studies in the same cohort showed that the women
serum recognized preferentially the DBL5ε domain and
that the level of DBL5ε antibodies was associated with a
protection against the placental infection [7,23]. These
accumulated observations motivated the need for analyzing the molecular variations occurring in this immunodominant domain of the VAR2CSA. Deciphering the
parasite population dynamics occurring during pregnancy that result into segregation of genotypes according
to woman parity or outcomes would be of particular
interest in the development of an efficient vaccine against
PAM.
This study presents parasite population dynamics in a
cohort of pregnant women in Senegal. Genotypes of the
parasites infecting pregnant women were determined by
msp2 and microsatellites genotyping. The sequencing of
the var2csa DBL5ε + Id5 (Interdomain 5) part and analysis of associated polymorphism was also performed from
parasites collected at different time points of the survey.

Methods
Ethics statement

For the whole study, the human experimentation guidelines of both French and Senegalese health authorities
were followed. Women included in the study were
explained the nature of the project, and informed oral
consent was obtained in the presence of an external and
independent witness. The study design, the sampling protocol, as well as the way to collect informed consent were
approved by the ethical committee of the Ministry of
Health, Senegal. Notably verbal consent was considered
valid at the time of study and recommended in this context of poorly literate study population.
Study population

Pregnant women were enrolled in a cohort study between
30 July and 15 October 2001 in Thiadiaye, 130 km east
from Dakar, Senegal. As previously described [23], 306
women pregnant for less than six months were enrolled if
they were not infected with malaria parasites at that time.
Women were followed by active and passive malaria
detection through monthly antenatal care visits and
through weekly home visits until delivery. During home
visits women presenting with fever were referred to the
emergency visit and blood samples were made for para-

site detection. Women presenting with fever and a positive blood smear were given curative treatment with
chloroquine, the drug recommended in Senegal at the
time of study. Peripheral blood was collected every
month after the woman was included in the study and
during emergency visits. Blood spots on filter paper were
stored for later DNA extraction and plasma was frozen.
At delivery, both peripheral and placental bloods were
also collected and processed as previously described [24].
Placental infection was observed in a total of 45 women
at delivery by microscopy and/or PCR. Among these
women, 32 also experienced at least one positive peripheral parasitaemia episode between enrolment and delivery. Eleven of those 32 women were primigravidae, five
were secundigravidae and 16 were multigravidae (gravidity ranging from 3 to 9). For the 32 women with consecutive parasitaemia recorded, a total of 201 samples were
obtained. From these, 108 were shown to be P. falciparum
positive. Four to 9 samples (including placental samples)
were available per woman, of which 2 to 8 were infected.
The determination of the parasite genotype was made by
combination of genotyping data of the msp2 gene and of
five distinct microsatellites.
DNA extraction, P. falciparum PCR detection and msp2
genotyping

DNA extraction from filter paper spots was done by Qiagen extraction for all molecular analyses. Msp2 genotyping was done as previously described [25]. Amplification
of msp2 fragment was done with a 5' fluorescein-labelled
primer: 5'-f GAA GGT AAT TAA AAC ATT GTC and a
reverse non-fluorescent primer: 5'-GAG GGA TGT TGC
TGC TCC ACA G. The PCR product was resolved by a
capillary gel electrophoresis in an ABI Prism 3100
Genetic Analyser (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems).
The results were analysed using GeneScan software (version 3.7; Applied Biosystems). The internal lane standard
was labelled with TAMRA to distinguish PCR products
from the standards and consisted of 28 bands ranging in
size from 37 to 14,079 bp. The chromatogram generated
for each PCR product allowed size identification of msp2
genotypes and their quantification through measures
from the area under the curve of the corresponding peak.
Plasmodium falciparum microsatellites genotyping

Five microsatellites were analysed: TAA81 (Genbank
AF010510), TAA87 (Genbank AF010571), TAA60 (Genbank AF010556), PfPK2 (Genbank X63648) and ARA2
(Genbank X17484) [26-28].
Amplification of those 5 fragments was done with two
multiplex PCR (one was optimized for TAA81 and
TAA87, and the other for TAA60, ARA2 and PfPK2). The
primers used were:

Guitard et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:165
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/165

- for TAA81: the forward primer 5'-CATTTCACACAACACAGGATT-3' and the reverse primer 5'-FamGAAATAAGGGAAGGTGAGGA-3'.
- for TAA87: the forward primer 5'-ACATGTTCATATTACTCACCA-3' and the reverse primer 5'-FamCATTCAACCACCTAACAAC-3'.
- for TAA60: the forward primer 5'-GGTAAA
AAAAGGAGGATAAAT-3' and the reverse primer 5'NedAAGTAGTAACGATGTTGACAAA-3'.
- for ARA2: the forward primer 5'-TCCGCTTTGAGTATTATTA-3' and the reverse primer 5'-HexTTAAAA
ACCAGAATTATCTAA-3'.
- for PfPK2: the forward primer 5'-ATTCCTTTCATCGCTACTAC-3' and the reverse primer 5'HexAAAGAAGGAACAAGCAGA-3'.
PCR products were resolved by capillary gel electrophoresis. The internal lane standard was labelled with
ROX, and the 5'-primer used for the PCR was labelled
with 6-carboxy-fluorescein, hexacloro-6-carboxy-fluorescein or trichloro-6-carboxy-fluorescein. The standards
consisted of 28 bands ranging in size from 35 to 350 bp.
Each genotype was characterized as described above.
Var2csa DBL5ε + Id5 cloning and sequencing

The var2csa area spanning the DBL5ε and the hypervariable Id5 were amplified from genomic DNA using high
fidelity enzyme (Phusion). The primers used for amplification were designed in the highly conserved blocks
flanking the DBL5ε+ Id5 following alignments of the 18
var2csa sequences that were available online. Primer
sequences are DBL5ε F: 5'-GTC ACC CCC GGG GAC
AAT GCA ATA AAA GAT TAC and DBL5ε Rv: 5'-TAG
GCA TTT GCG GCC GCC TTC AAG TTC AGC TGG
AAT ATT. The PCR products were digested with XmaI
and NotI for cloning into the baculovirus vector,
pAcGP67-A [29]or were inserted into a topo TA cloning
vector. A minimum of 5 clones per monoallellic isolate
and up to 18 in polyallelic samples were sequenced to
analyse multiple reads for one sequence and thus limit
sequencing artefact. Sequencing was performed by
GATC company [30] (Accession Numbers [Genbank:
GQ476876-GQ476980]).
GQ476827-GQ476874,
Sequences generated were translated using the RevTrans
webserver [31]. Only sequences without errors and stop
codons were used for the analysis. Two sequences were
considered as common DBL5ε + Id5 gene type if they had
more than 96% sequence identities as previously
described [32]. The final data set of DBL5ε+ Id5
sequences obtained from samples of the 32 pregnant
women at different time points in pregnancy contained
172 sequences, fourty eight of these originated from placental isolates.

Analysis of codon-based evolutionary models

Nucleotide sequences were aligned using the RevTrans
server with a translated multiple alignment of corresponding sequences as input. The multiple alignment of
nucleotide sequences was used for constructing a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using the program
PAUP [33]. The maximum likelihood tree and nucleotide
multiple alignment was used for detection of positively
selected sites in DBL5ε + Id5, using the program codeml
from the PAML package version 3.15 [34]. Four codonbased models were tested: M1, M2, M7 and M8, where
M1 and M7 assume all dN/dS ratios to lie between 0 and
1 (no positive selection), and M2 and M8 assume an extra
class of codons where dN/dS >1 (positive selection).
Comparison of likelihood values for M1 and M2 or M7
and M8 were performed using a chi-square test. The
Bayesian empirical Bayes procedure was used to estimate
the significance of dN/dS ratios in the DBL5ε + Id5 [35].
Only codons with P < 0.05 in both models M2 and M8
were identified as positively selected sites. Positions corresponding to positively selected sites were identified in
the DBL5ε structural model published earlier [36], and
mapped using PyMol [33].
Analysis of differential amino acids sequences

The translated multiple alignment generated with
MAFFT was used for analysis of sequence differences
between different groups of the data. In addition, two
alternative sets of DBL5ε + Id5 sequences were included
in the analysis: 21 sequences were from 11 isolates of
cerebral malaria patients, and 19 sequences from 10 nulligravid infected women. The SigniSite method was used
for identifying positions which have differing amino acids
correlated to the ranking of sequences (Hoof et al Submitted). Analysis of sequences from PAM isolates according to birth weight of the children or parity of the women
were also performed.
Anti DBL5ε antibody level

The DBL5ε domain of a placental isolate obtained in a
previous study in Senegal [3] was amplified, cloned, and
the corresponding recombinant protein produced in baculovirus-infected SF9/Hi5 cells, and purified as described
[23]. The recombinant protein was coated in 96-well
plates, and the level of specific IgG in plasmas of the 32
women at different time points was measured by ELISA
as previously described [37].

studied here allowed the appreciation of the parasite population structure for each recorded infection. Of the 108
infected blood spots analysed, complete genotyping data
were obtained for 104 samples. During the follow up, the
number of distinct malaria episodes recorded per woman
ranged from 2 to 8 (1 malaria episode here correspond to
the detection of P. falciparum in the woman blood sample). When the same parasite population (the same genotype) was found in successive samples of the women who
did not receive treatment in between, this was not considered as a new malaria infection. It should be noted that
many malaria parasite detections were performed retrospectively by PCR in women samples, meaning that treatment was not associated to each positive sample. The
number of distinct parasite genotypes that have been successfully identified per sample ranged from 1 to 4, among
the 2 to 8 positive parasitaemia that were detected
throughout per woman during the follow up.
Based on msp2 and microsatellites genotyping and previous sequencing data available in the laboratory, the
number of clones to be sequenced was arbitrarily defined
as 5 clones in monoclonal samples and 18 in polyclonal
samples.
Identical or almost identical DBL5ε + Id5 sequences
from different women were rare. Actually, we could identify 64 DBL5ε + Id5 sequence types among different
women based on a 96% sequence identity cut off, when
applying a more stringent cut off of 99% we could identify
104 unique DBL5ε + Id5 sequence types. Common
DBL5ε + Id5 types were found in 53 samples from different women while using the96% cut off, while common
types were only found in 13 distinct isolates with a 99%
cut off. This indicate low overlap in the var2csa gene subrepertoires between parasite population from distinct
isolates. In consecutive samples from the same woman it
was possible to identify similar DBL5ε + Id5 types sharing
a 100% sequence identity.
Fifty seven (55%) samples were monoallelic according
to the genotyping (Table 1). Among the 104 samples, 54
presented with the same number of msp2/microsatellite

genotypes and DBL5ε sequence types. 21 presented with
a smaller number of DBL5ε sequence types than of parasite genotypes. These differences are probably related to
the lower sensitivity of the cloning/sequencing technique,
as compared to the optimized genotyping methods.
Actually, Genescan detection of fluorescent fragments
allows for detection of minor genotypes down to 2% of
the population [25]. For 29 isolates, an unexpected bias in
the DBL5ε + Id5 sequence number compared to the genotype number was noted. This was unexpected considering the higher sensitivity in population structuring of
msp2/microsatellite genotyping over the gene cloning
and sequencing in general, and supports previous findings that some circulating P. falciparum parasites, like the
HB3 strain, may harbour more than one var2csa copy in
their genome [38,39].
Dynamics of parasite populations during pregnancy

In the particular context of Senegal, where chloroquine
was still recommended at the time of study, the overall
analysis of parasite genotypes evolution at different time
points during pregnancy shows two patterns according to
msp2 and microsatellites polymorphisms. These two patterns were confirmed by analysis of variable blocks in the
DBL5ε + Id5 sequencing (Figure 1):
- Pattern A: (n = 16): In this group of women, emergence of a specific genotype which can persist, and be
found in the placenta at delivery is observed. The persisting genotypes are detected here as early as 69 days
before delivery and in the following samples.
- Pattern B: (n = 16): In this group, several distinct
infections or emerging genotypes are recorded during
the follow up. Many samples from this group were P.
falciparum negative suggesting that those women
cleared their infection before being reinfected by
novel parasite populations. The genotypes found in
the placental blood at delivery have previously not
been detected in the peripheral blood during the follow up.

igravid women differed according to the complexity of
infection: primigravid women presenting with a monoallelic placental infection delivered babies with a higher
birth weight than those from women harbouring more
than one parasite genotypes (figure 2, p = 0.05, Mann
Whitney U-test).
Levels of anti-VAR2CSA-DBL5ε antibodies

Figure 1 Dynamics of parasite populations during pregnancy.
Two kinds of patterns (A and B) are described. P1, P2 represent positive
parasitaemia from peripheral blood collected during the pregnancy,
Pla represents placental blood collected at delivery. msp2/microsatellites genotypes are represented by squares. For one pattern, the various colors of the square represent a distinct msp2/microsatellite
genotype. The different DBL5ε+Id5 sequence types are represented by
different colored circles.

No significant difference was seen when comparing
means between consecutive samplings from pattern A
and pattern B. The patterns A and B only show samplings
with positive parasiteamias. Many samplings with no parasite detected were observed in pattern B suggesting
clearance of previous infection hence the renewal of parasite populations observed in sub-sequent samplings of
that patterns, as opposed to pattern A where no clearance
was seen in consecutive samples.
The placental parasiteamia did not differ between the 2
patterns (p = 0.35, Mann Whitney, U-test). The women,
belonging to the different patterns, differed neither in
their parity status (p = 0.46, Mann Whitney, U-test ), the
birth weight of the offsprings (p = 0.37, Mann Whitney,
U-test), nor in the time of delivery (p = 0.41, Mann Whitney, U-test), the latter to consider the time of possible
exposure to malaria transmission. The mean time elapsed
between sampling during pregnancy and delivery did not
significantly differ among women in pattern A and in pattern B. This suggests that the genotypes do not persist in
group A because the time between samplings and delivery was shorter compared to group B.

When women were segregated on whether they harboured persistent/long lasting genotypes (pattern A), or
not (pattern B) on Figure 1, the mean level of antiVAR2CSA IgG was lower at enrolment in the former
group (mean = 65.05 AU, standard deviation 27.62) as
compared to the latter group (mean = 83.45 AU, standard
deviation 16.56) (p < 0.05, Mann Whitney, U-test). At
delivery, the mean levels of anti-VAR2CSA IgG were similar between the two patterns (p = 0.41, Mann Whitney):
respectively 94.3AU (n = 15, standard deviation: 10.6) and
93.7 AU (n = 12, standard deviation 10.1).
Sequence analysis of the var2csa DBL5ε + Id5

To investigate the effect of parasite population dynamics
on that of var2csa types, the DBL5ε + Id5 part of var2csa
were sequenced from all isolates and 172 sequences were
obtained from women. Multiple alignment of these
sequences (Additional file 1) showed that the var2csa
area corresponding to its DBL5ε + Id5 domains is relatively conserved with a pair-wise amino acids sequence
identity within 75-100% (average of 85%). When only the
DBL5ε is considered, the amino acid identity averaged
88%. Standard phylogenetic tree construction demon-

Impact of the parasite population structure

The disappearance of the different genotype from the
woman blood was not different when women received a
curative dose of chloroquine or not during the follow up
(p = 0.4, Mann Whitney, U-test), This could be explained
by parasite resistance to chloroquine at the time of study
that was later supported by the high prevalence of pfcrt
K76T mutants (>70%) in this same cohort [40]. No relation between the complexity of infection and parasite
density of the samples was found (p = 0.4; Mann Whitney
U-test). However, birth weight of infants born from prim-

strated that sequences from different geographic origins
(obtained from GenBank) were scattered evenly in the
tree indicating that sequences of var2csa from Senegal
isolates do not differ at the DBL5ε+ Id5 area from those of
the global repertoire (Figure 3), as previously observed on
the DBL3X domain.
When focusing on the 2 distinct DBL5ε + Id5
sequences found in some monoallelic isolates, the rela-

tionship between the 2 sequence types still appeared to
be as distant as between any other different isolate.
Identification of amino acid variation in the sequences of
DBL5ε

The variations in amino acid sequence are mostly located
in variable blocks, in loop regions on surface exposed
parts of helices, mostly in the S3 region (Figure 4), as previously reported for other VAR2CSA DBLs sequences
[20].

isolates and 17 DBL5ε database sequences available from Genbank (MTS1, M24, WR80, PC40, P13, FCR3, IT4var4, V1 S, Indo, 3D7, KMWII, T2C6, Mcvar6,
HB3-1, HB3-2, PC49, P13). Multiple and distinct DBL5ε sequences from monoallelic isolates are shown in colored circles.

conserved, the distribution of amino acids is however not
highly significant. Overall, these data show that there are
only weak tendencies for differential patterns of amino
acids in DBL5ε sequences from field isolates.

Figure 4 DBL5ε variable positions. A. Positions where all residues
have a conservation of <70% in the alignment of 172 sequences from
pregnant women are mapped in red on a DBL5ε structure model [36].
B. The same mapped positions as A, where the model is rotated 180
degrees, showing the variable sites mostly located in the S3 region of
the DBL structure.

The calculated likelihood of model M1 (assuming no
positive selection) was compared to M2 (assuming positive selection) and a chi-square test showed that the M2
model was significantly better than M1 (p < 0.001). Similarly, a test of the models M7 and M8 showed the model
M8 assuming positive selection to fit the data better than
M7 (p < 0.001). Positions identified to be under significantly positive selection in both models M2 and M8 are
reported here. Thirty positions were found to be under
positive selection or to correlate with parity and birth
weight (see Figure 5A and 5B), and 22 of these are located
in epitopes previously mapped in the model by Andersen
[36] (see Figure 5C). Many of the positions under positive
selection are located in proximity of regions, which vary
in length (Additional File 1). This finding supports the
previous finding, that most variability on the amino acid
level is also located around gaps in the alignment. By
mapping the positive selection sites in the model (Figure
5A and 5B), it can be seen that most positions under positive selection are located on the surface of both sides of
the model and many are located in loops. Comparison of
positions identified to be under positive selection with
positions identified by SigniSite analysis, among
sequences from cerebral malaria patients and from pregnant women, showed that only one position was redundant (Figure 5A and 5B). None of the residues identified
by SigniSite to differ between parasites from nulli-gravid
women and pregnant women were shown to be positively
selected. Here, the search for such significant amino acid
sites correlating with the ranking of sequences for clinical
form, parity status, and birth weight showed that only a
few amino acid positions were differing. These positions
are 72, 152, 153, 290, 291, 294 and 320 in the alignment
(Additional file 1). As the sequences are in general highly

Discussion
Plasmodium falciparum parasites exhibit extensive polymorphism, and natural infections often are composed of
a mixture of genetically distinct parasite clones. The aim
of this study was to determine the population dynamics
of P. falciparum in pregnant women and investigate
potential relation with malaria consequences during
pregnancy.
Parasite genotyping at msp2 and 5 distinct microsatellites using a quantitative capillary-electrophoresis-based
analysis of fluorescent fragments, allowed a better
description of the parasite populations over time. The
unexpected association bias in some isolates where more
distinct DBL5ε+ Id5 sequence types were found as compared to the level of genetic diversity defined by msp2/
microsatellites genotyping suggests that some circulating
P. falciparum parasites can present with more than one
var2csa gene copy in their genome. This was particularly
highlighted in the 24 monoallelic samples where at least 2
types of DBL5ε+Id5 sequences were consistently found.
This finding is not totally surprising as existence of 2
var2csa copies were already described in the genome of
the laboratory strain HB3 and recently reported in several
P. falciparum isolates [38]. Transcripts of such duplicated
var2csa genes were also reported [39]. Although no relation was found here between these particular isolates
with multiple var2csa copies and virulence, it will be of
interest to investigate relationship between the parasite
var2csa genome copy number and the pathogenesis of
PAM in a larger cohort of dedicated study. Considering
the present finding that more than one var2csa copy can
co-exist in one parasite genome, the hypothesis for diversity generation suggested for other var genes could also
be applicable to var2csa (UpsE genes) [41]. The copy
number of var2csa in one genome still is limited and
could explain why its diversity is not as enormous [18].
The multiplicity of a P. falciparum infection at a particular time-point is, indeed, a result of many factors,
including epidemiology, clinical status of the host, intake
of anti-malarial drugs, sequestration and degree of host
immunity. Thus analysis from a single time-point sample
presents limitations in revealing the infecting parasite
populations. In pregnant host, immunity is an important
factor as after successive pregnancies women acquire a
high level of anti-VAR2CSA IgG, and a protection from
low birth weight, placental infection and malaria anaemia
[42]. Exploring the impact of the antibody level to
VAR2CSA on clinical protection, and also on the Plasmodium genotype dynamics thus appeared as a necessity.

pregnant women. In purple is shown the position that is both under positive selection pressure and correlated with birth weight and parity. B. Similar
to A, but rotated 180 degrees. C. Epitopes identified previously, in blue are shown the conserved residues, and in green, the variable residues, predicted to be targeted by surface reactive antibodies[51].

In a previous study on pregnant women living in a
perennial transmission area, the diversity of placental
infection was not related to parity or parasite density [43],
while, in a seasonal transmission setting, polyallelic infections in the placenta were preferentially found in primigravidae [44]. Here, the complexity of the infection at
delivery in the placenta, was associated to a lower infant
birth weight in primigravidae. This effect was not found
in multigravidae. Reduced risk of clinical malaria in children infected with multiple clones of P. falciparum is
often reported [45,46]. The finding in this study rather
points out the multiplicity of infection in the placenta as a
potential risk factor to low birth weight in women having
no or low immunity against placental parasites. One possible explanation for this virulence factor may be that in
naïve hosts the survival of the parasite population is controlled by a competition occurring between the genotypes present leading to an augmentation of their

virulence, whereas in immune hosts, such competition is
limited by the specific non-sterilizing immunity, that
allows the persistence of some genotypes without any
clinical impact [47].
Analysis of the within-host dynamics of Plasmodium
infection during pregnancy in this study allowed to visualize the picture of the parasite populations over the
course of pregnancy in a context of drug inefficacy. Actually similar parasite genotypes were found in consecutive
blood samples collected from women at different time
points during pregnancy. The analysis clearly points that
some parasite variants were able to persist over several
weeks, and were found at delivery in the placenta while
others were cleared. The role of anti-VAR2CSA antibodies in parasite clearance is suggested as women with low
level of these antibodies early in pregnancy could not
clear their infection. Different studies [11,20,48] suggest
that parasites have different binding capacity or biological

Guitard et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:165

advantage that may promote their survival in distinct
physiological environments. In the current longitudinal
investigation, long lasting parasite genotype not only
appeared to result from the inefficacy of chloroquine that
was later proven [40], but also to low anti-VAR2CSA
immunity at early pregnancy. This highlights a possible
role of anti-VAR2CSA antibodies in parasite clearance
and is in line with recent observations that high levels of
antibodies to VSA-PAM in pregnant Malawian women
correlated with malaria parasite clearance and less anaemia in a context of treatment failure [49]. As women with
high anti-VAR2CSA IgG still could be infected by novel
parasite genotypes with a distinct var2csa variant in their
genome, it is possible that attaining the mature and protective immunity induced by VAR2CSA may require a
gradual acquisition of antibody targeting a limited repertoire of variants.
PfEMP1 proteins are generally highly polymorphic and
under significant antibody selection at the IE surface for
diversification. This diversity was also described in
var2csa in a previous study based on its DBL3x domain
[20], demonstrating that var2csa could vary in sequence
between primigravidae and multigravidae. Attempts in
the current study of correlating DBL5ε sequence types to
variables such as parity or birth weight might have been
distorted by use of gDNA instead of cDNA as it now
clearly appears that some parasites can harbor more than
one var2csa gene copy in their genome. Although few significant sites under positive selection can be found in the
amino acid sequence of the DBL5ε, a relatively high
homology was noted among sequences from all field isolates studied. The contrast between this high level of conservation in this domain and the large diversity
previously described for other non var2csa var gene [32],
can explain why antibodies induced by DBL5ε recombinant proteins are cross-reactive to different placental isolates [22], and why serum from women from different
origins are able to recognize the same placental isolates
[4]. Conformation constraints within this domain seem to
be important and necessary to the parasite, making this
area of VAR2CSA an attractive target for induction of
cross-reactive antibodies.

Conclusions
Two patterns of P. falciparum dynamics in pregnant
women are described in this study according to the antiVAR2CSA IgG level of the women at enrolment. The correlation between low levels of anti-VAR2CSA antibodies
and the presence of persisting parasite genotypes in the
placenta at delivery suggests that the acquisition of a protective immunity in pregnant women is gradual. This
protective immunity directed against VAR2CSA is
acquired after only one or two pregnancies, suggesting

Page 9 of 11

that the target of antibodies must be relatively conserved.
The DBL5ε domain is one of the immunodominant part
of VAR2CSA [22,23,37,50,51]. It's sequence appears
much more conserved than other non var2csa var genes,
suggesting that this domain might be an interesting target
for vaccine development aiming at inducing cross-reactive immunity.
Some parasite isolate may harbor more than one
var2csa copy in their genome, making necessary further
analysis on transcripts to better evaluate the impact of
such variations in the var2csa variants fluctuation among
pregnant women and in the acquisition of protective
immunity. It is, therefore, of major importance to identify
the few critical VAR2CSA variants, the combination of
which can induce antibodies with broad reactivity against
PAM parasite isolates.
