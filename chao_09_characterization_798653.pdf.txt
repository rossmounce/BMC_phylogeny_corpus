Abstract
Background: Debaryomyces hansenii is one of the most salt tolerant species of yeast and has
become a model organism for the study of tolerance mechanisms against salinity. The goal of this
study was to identify key upregulated genes that are involved in its adaptation to high salinity.
Results: By using forward subtractive hybridization we have cloned and sequenced DhAHP from
D. hansenii that is significantly upregulated during salinity stress. DhAHP is orthologous to the alkly
hydroperoxide reductase of the peroxiredoxin gene family, which catalyzes the reduction of
peroxides at the expense of thiol compounds. The full-lengthed cDNA of DhAHP has 674 bp of
nucleotide and contains a 516 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a deduced protein of 172
amino acid residues (18.3 kDa). D. hansenii Ahp is a cytosolic protein that belongs to the Ahp of
the 1-Cys type peroxiredoxins. Phylogentically, the DhAhp and Candida albicans Ahp11 (Swiss-Prot:
Q5AF44) share a common ancestry but show divergent evolution. Silence of its expression in D.
hansenii by RNAi resulted in decreased tolerance to salt whereas overexpression of DhAHP in D.
hansenii and the salt-sensitive yeasts Saccharomyces cereviasiae and Pichia methanolica conferred a
higher tolerance with a reduced level of reactive oxygen species.
Conclusion: In conclusion, for the first time our study has identified alkly hydroperoxide
reductase as a key protein involved in the salt tolerance of the extremely halophilic D. hansenii.
Apparently, this enzyme plays a multi-functional role in the yeast's adaptation to salinity; it serves
as a peroxidase in scavenging reactive oxygen species, as a molecular chaperone in protecting
essential proteins from denaturation, and as a redox sensor in regulating H2O2-mediated cell
defense signaling.

Background
Debaryomyces hansenii is an ascomycetous salt- and high
pH-tolerant yeast that has been defined as halotolerant or
halophilic [1]. It was isolated from saline environments

such as sea water [2] or concentrated brines [3], representing one of the most salt tolerant species of yeasts. This
marine yeast can tolerate salinity levels up to 24% (4.11
M) of NaCl [2]. In contrast, growth of the Baker's yeast

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is severely inhibited when salinity
reaches 10% NaCl [3]. Thus, D. hansenii has become a
model organism for the study of salt tolerance mechanisms in eukaryotic cells [4]. It is now well recognized that
the mechanisms by which all organisms achieve osmotic
and ionic equilibrium are mediated by orthologous
mechanisms based on conserved biochemical and/or
physiological functions that are inherently necessary for
essential metabolic processes [5].
Under saline conditions, D. hansenii accumulates large
amounts of Na+ without being intoxicated even when K+
is present at low concentration in the environment [6]. In
fact, Na+ improves growth and protects D. hansenii in the
presence of additional stress factors [1]. For example, at
high or low temperature and extreme pH growth of the
yeast is improved by the presence of 1 M NaCl [7]. It has
been clearly shown that sodium ions are less toxic for D.
hansenii as compared with other organisms; therefore, it is
considered a 'sodium-includer' organism [8]. The reduced
toxic effect by Na+ and its accumulation at high levels
under high salt is probably indicative of an adaptive strategy of D. hansenii for growth in hypersaline environments
[9]. The organism must posses an array of advantageous
characteristics that collectively confer its high halotolerance. Earlier studies have identified a number of saltrelated genes in the extreme halophilic yeast D. hansenii,
such as HOG1 (MAP kinase involved in high-osmolarity
glycerol synthesis pathway) [10], ENA1 and ENA2 (plasmamembrane Na+-ATPase [11], GPD1 and GPP (NADglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3phosphatase) [12], NHX1 (vacuolar Na+ antiporter) [13]
and KHA1 (Na+/H+ antiporter) [14]. As expected, most of
these salt-upregulated genes are involved in osmoregulation or transport of ions. However, the collective underlying mechanisms by which D. hansenii tolerates high levels
of NaCl remain unkown.
All aerobic organisms require oxygen for efficient production of energy, but at the same time the organisms are constantly exposed to oxidative stress. This can be caused by
partially reduced forms of molecular oxygen (e.g. superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical),
known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are generated as normal metabolism byproducts, especially from
respiration [15]. These ROS are highly reactive molecules
that are capable of damaging cellular constituents such as
DNA, RNA, lipids and proteins [16]. In adaptation to oxidative stress, aerobic organisms have evolved multiple
enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems to protect
their cellular constituents from ROS and to maintain their
cellular redox state [17]. Accumulation of ROS is known
to increase under many, if not all, stress conditions as the
defensive scavenging systems become insufficient to cope
with increasing levels of stress.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/182

The enzymatic scavenging system for ROS involves a
number of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in different cellular compartments. A series of peroxidases referred to as
peroxiredoxins (Prxs) that are ancestral thiol-dependent
selenium- and heme-free peroxidases [18] have been
found from archaea, lower prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes. These peroxidases constitute a large family including
bacterial AhpC proteins and eukaryotic thioredoxin peroxidases (TPxs) [19]. Prxs are abundant, well-distributed
peroxidases that reduce H2O2, organic peroxides and peroxynitrite at the expense of thiol compounds. Thus, Prxs
are considered alternative hydroperoxide scavenging
enzymes, as they can reduce both organic and inorganic
peroxides as well as oxidized enzymes. Based on the
number of cysteine residues involved in catalysis, Prxs can
be divided into three classes: typical 2-Cys Prxs, atypical 2Cys prxs and 1-Cys Prxs [20]. Prxs are ubiquitous proteins
that use an active site Cys residue from one of the
homodimers to reduce H2O2. The peroxidative cysteine
sulfenic acid formed upon reaction with peroxide is
reduced directly by glutathione. It is suggested that Prxs
can act alternatively as peroxidases or as molecular chaperones by changing their molecular complexes. Furthermore, the oxidized cysteinly species, cysteine sulfenic
acid, may play a dual role by acting as a catalytic intermediate in the peroxidase activity and as a redox sensor in
regulating H2O2-mediated cell defense signaling.
Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (Ahp) is the second known
member of a class of disulfide oxidoreductases [21] and a
member of the thiol-dependent peroxiredoxin family
[20], which possesses activity against H2O2, organic peroxides, and peroxynitrite [22]. Therefore, expression of
Ahp genes plays an important role in peroxide resistance
(oxidative stress) in Bacillus subtilis [23], Clostridium pasteurianum [24] and Burkholderia cenocepacia [25]. Moreover, the compensatory expression of AhpC in Burkholderia
pseduomallei katG is essential for its resistance to reactive
nitrogen intermediates [26].
In this article, we report the isolation of DhAHP from the
extreme halophilic yeast D. hansenii via subtractive
hybridization of cDNA isolated from high salt treated vs.
non-treated cells. Further characterization of DhAHP
showed that it is a gene orthologous to alkyl hydroperoxide reductase of Candida albicans (Gene ID: 3637850
AHP11). On the basis of the deduced amino acid
sequence, we propose that DhAhp be classified as an alkyl
hydroperoxide reductase. Silencing of its expression in D.
hansenii by RNAi resulted in decreased tolerance while
overexpression conferred enhanced tolerance to salinity.
Furthermore, overexpression of DhAHP in the salt-sensitive S. cerevisiae and P. methanolica also endowed upon
their cells greater tolerance to NaCl. These overexpression
transformants exhibited reduced levels of ROS under

salinity stress. These results suggest that the cytosolic Ahp,
induced and accumulated under saline conditions, may
play a key role in this extremely halophilic yeast in adaption to high salinity by scavenging ROS, serving as chaperone and mediating H2O2-mediated defense signaling.

Results
Characterization of salt-induced gene in D. hansenii
In this study, forward subtractive hybridization PCR was
employed to investigate the genes of D. hansenii that are
induced by salt. The subtracted cDNA library was enriched
in differentially expressed sequences after treatment with
2.5 M NaCl for 24 min, relative to control cDNA. One of
the selected clones that showed a significant increase in
expression after salt induction is a homolog to the gene
encoding for alkyl hydroperoxide reductase in C. albicans
(Gene ID: 3637850 AHP11). This D. hansenii gene,
DhAHP, was further characterized for its genomic organization, expression pattern and function.
Cloning of full-lengthed cDNA of DhAHP
To obtain a full-lengthed cDNA for DhAHP a forward gene
specific primer (GSP) was designed and used for amplification of the 3' end of DhAHP, based on the partial
sequence of the clone isolated from the subtracted cDNA
library. A single DNA fragment of about 433 bp (Fig. 1A)
was amplified using the primers of GeneRace 3' and forward GSP. According to the 3'-end fragment sequence, a
specific reverse GSP was designed to amplify the 5'-end of
DhAHP and a fragment of 557 bp was obtained (Fig. 1B).
Alignment of the 3' and 5' RACE products showed that the
full-lengthed cDNA of DhAHP has 240 bp overlapped,
while 59 bp of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) is found
upstream of the first ATG codon and 99 bp of the 3' UTR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/182

is found downstream from the stop codon in the amplified sequence.
The full-lengthed cDNA of DhAHP has 674 bp of nucleotide and contains a 516 bp open reading frame (ORF)
encoding a deduced protein of 172 amino acid residues
(Fig. 2). The protein has an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.84
and a calculated molecular mass of 18.3 kDa. The richest
amino acids are Ala (11.7% by frequency), followed by
Gly (9.4%), Thr (8.8%), Asp (7.6%), Lys (7.0%), Leu
(7.0%), Val (6.4%) and Ile (6.4%). Hydrophobic and
hydrophilic amino acids account for 57.8% and 42.2% of
the total amino acids, respectively.
Characteristics of DhAHP and related genes
The deduced D. hansenii Ahp amino acid sequence was
compared with those of related proteins from the EMBL
database using the EMBOSS alignment program. The
analysis showed that the protein has 72.7% similarity to
C. albicans alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (Gene ID:
3637850 AHP11). Thus, the isolated gene is homologous
to the Ahp gene of C. albicans and is therefore named
DhAHP. The DhAhp sequence was also compared with a
number of previously identified Ahp and peroxiredoxin
homologs from different organisms using the protein
sequence alignment program CLUSTAL W. Multiple
sequence alignment analysis showed that DhAhp has 58%
similarity to AHP11 (Swiss-Prot: Q5AF44) of C. albicans,
37% to peroxiredoxin of Pisum sativum (Swiss-Prot:
B3GV28), 34% to peroxiredoxin of P. tremula (Swiss-Prot:
Q8S3L0), 33% to PMP20 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe
(Swiss-Prot: O14313), 30% to AHP1 of S. cerevisiae
(Swiss-Prot: P38013), and 25% to Homo sapiens peroxiredoxin 5 (Swiss-Prot: P30044) (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, Cys54, which is conserved in all related Prxs, is identified as
the peroxidative cysteine in DhAhp.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the DhAhp protein is
more homologous to yeast Ahps than to other Ahps from
plants or peroxiredoxins from mammals. The DhAhp is
located in the same subgroup as Ahps from yeasts, such as
C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. Taken together, these results
suggest that the Ahp of D. hansenii is more closely related
to those of yeasts than to the plant Ahps or mammalian
peroxiredoxins. It is conceivable that its function or enzymatic characteristics may be close to those of yeast Ahps
(Fig. 3B).

Genome organization and expression of DhAHP
Southern blot analysis showed a single DNA fragment
with homology to DhAHP (Fig. 4A) suggesting that it
exists as a single copy in the genome of D. hansenii. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of DhAHP is
modulated by salt. A single transcript was detected in the
cells treated with 2.5 M NaCl for 16 min (Fig. 4B). In con-

trast, only a small amount of the transcript was present in
the control cell. Based on the differences in band intensity, it is evident that expression of DhAHP increased several fold only after 16 min of salt treatment. Thus,
expression of the gene is rapidly induced by salt in D.
hansenii.
The time course of induction of DhAHP by salt was further
analyzed by relative quantification real-time RT-PCR. A
small increase in DhAHP transcript was detected as early
as 4 min upon salt (2.5 M NaCl) treatment, but its expression was rapidly accelerated thereafter. Its level increased
1.9 and 2.9 fold over the control at 12 and 24 min, respectively, with the maximum induction of 8.0 to 12.1 fold
occurring between 48 and 72 min. After reaching its peak

of expression at 72 min, the transcript dropped off at 144
min (Fig. 5).
Silencing by RNA interference and overexpression of
DhAHP in D. hansenii
To assess the effect of loss-of-function and gain-of-function of DhAHP on salt tolerance of D. hansenii, the silencing and overexpression transformants were examined for
their ability to grow on YM11 medium containing 2.5 M
and 3.5 M NaCl, respectively. As demonstrated by realtime PCR, the RNAi transformant of D. hansenii exhibited
reduced expression of DhAHP transcript in the presence of
2.5 M NaCl, relative to its wild type strain (Fig. 6A). Without any salt, both wild type strain and RNAi transformant
showed a normal growth trend over 60 h (Fig. 6B). How-

ever, growth of the RNAi transformant was severely inhibited by 2.5 M NaCl.
The overexpression transformant of D. hansenii had much
higher AHP expression levels than its wild type counterpart when grown under 3.5 M NaCl and in the presence of
the inducer methanol (Fig. 7A). Without any salt the overexpression trasnsformant showed a comparable growth to
that of the wild type strain with or without the presence of
methanol in the culture media (Fig. 8). Growth of both
the wild type strain and the overexpression transformant
was inhibited by 3.5 M NaCl (Fig. 8B). However, only the
overexpression transformant showed enhanced growth in
the presence of the inducer methanol. Thus, overexpression and suppression of DhAHP reduce the salt tolerance

of D. hansenii, respectively. The small enhancements in
growth in the overexpression transformant under high
salt, as compared to the wild type strain, is expected as
expression of endogenous DhAHP can be largely induced
by salt in this halophilic organism (Fig. 5).
Overexpression of DhAHP in S. cerevisiae and P.
methanolica
The function of DhAHP was further tested by overexpression of the gene in the two salt-sensitive yeasts S. cerevisiae
and P. methanolica. As expected, the levels of DhAHP transcript in the wild type strains of the two species were very
low even under high salt conditions, but its expression
levels in the overexpression transformants increased drastically, especially in the presence of the inducer methanol

media without containing salt in the presence or absence
of methanol (Figs. 9a, Fig. 10a). In contrast, growth of the
wild type strains of these salt-sensitive species was largely
inhibited by high salt (Figs. 9b, Fig. 10b). However, only
the overexpression transformants were able to maintain
substantial growth under high salt, especially in the presence of methanol. The degrees of enhancement in salt tolerance by overexpression of DhAHP were more significant
in S. cerevisiae and in P. methanolica (Figs. 9b, 10b) than in
D. hansenii (Fig. 8b). The results indicate that overexpression of DhAHP confers enhanced salt tolerance to both
salt sensitive S. cerevisiae and P. methanolica, allowing
them to be able to grow at higher salt levels than they can
normally tolerate.
Intracellular ROS
To see if the enhanced salt tolerance by overexpression of
DhAHP in the three yeast species was due to reduced oxidative stress, the cellular ROS level was determined after
the cells were grown under high NaCl conditions (3.5 M
for D. hansenii, 2.0 M for S. cerevisiae and 2.5 M for P.
methanolica) for 5 h. As shown in Fig.11AâC, NaCl

induced accumulation of ROS in the wild type strains of
the three yeast species, and the addition of methanol further increased its accumulation. It is also noticeable that
the increases in ROS accumulation under high salt were
much greater in S. cerevisiae and P. methanolica than in D.
hansenii. The DhAHP overexpression transformants of the
three species also exhibited a similar trend towards salt
and methanol treatments but the amounts of ROS accumulated were considerably lower than those of their wild
type counterparts. The reduction in ROS accumulation
was more significant upon methanol induction, especially
in the overexpression transformants of S. cerevisiae and P.
methanolica. These results, correlated well with the data on
levels of DhAHP expression (Fig. 7AâC) and on growth

(Figs. 8, 9, 10), indicate that expression of DhAHP in these
yeasts can lead to enhanced salt tolerance by reducing the
level of accumulated ROS via DhAhp. Thus, the higher
sensitivities of S. cerevisiae and P. methanolica to salt, relative to D. hansenii, may be associated with their inability
to scavenge ROS.

Discussion
Organisms are constantly exposed to various stresses,
which cause considerable reduction in growth. In adaptation, organisms respond to stress through a number of
physiological and developmental changes. Thus, expression of many genes is altered in such responses. Identification of the particular gene or genes responsible for the
specific adaption to such stimuli is a major challenge in
modern biology; it requires methods which rapidly and
efficiently compare the transcripts expressed in the organism subject to stress. An equalizing cDNA subtraction
hybridization method provides the technical basis for
such a comparison. It has been demonstrated successfully
to clone a number of differentially expressed genes [27].

Isolation of differentially expressed genes in the extremely
halophilic yeast D. hansenii would serve as an initial step
towards understanding its tolerance mechanisms against
salinity.
Salt-induced genes in D. hansenii
As discussed in the Background section, a number of saltrelated genes have been identified in the extremely halophilic yeast D. hansenii. As expected, most of the saltupregulated genes identified so far are involved in
osmoregulation or transport of ions. By using forward
subtractive hybridization, we have identified, cloned and
sequenced DhAHP, a new salt induced gene, from D.
hansenii by applying salt stress. Further characterization of
the functional role of the gene will aid to our understanding of the underlying halotolerance mechanisms in this
halophilic yeast.
Characterization of salt-induced DhAHP and its protein
High salinity, which is caused typically by NaCl, results in
ion toxicity and hyperosmotic stress leading to numerous
secondary pathological effects including generation of
ROS [28] and programmed cell death. It's not surprising
that one of the major upregulated genes under salinity
stress, DhAHP, is orthologous to the alkyl hydroperoxide

reductase of the peroxiredoxin family. Ahp is a member of
the peroxiredoxin family of enzymes, which possess activity against H2O2, organic peroxides, and peroxynitrite
[18]. DhAHP has not been previously described for its role
in salt tolerance in D. hansenii. Comparison of protein
sequences showed that DhAhp shares a high similarity to
Ahp11 of the yeast C. albicans. Multiple sequence alignment analysis of Ahps showed the protein from D. hansenii has a high similarity to that of C. albicans (Fig. 3A) and
phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ahp of D. hansenii is
more closely related to the yeast than to the plant or mammalian peroxiredoxins (Fig. 3B). Thus, DhAhp belongs to
the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase of the peroxiredoxin
family. Previously, Kurtzman and Robnett [29] have suggested that D. hansenii is phylogenetically related to C.
albicans based on the fact that they are both ascomycetous
yeasts. The high similarity between the Ahps from both
species further supports this notion. In addition, both
organisms use an alternative genetic yeast code in which
the CUG codon may be used as a serine codon [30]. Taken
together, these results suggest that DhAhp and C. albicans
Ahp11 have common ancestry, but show divergent evolution.

The closest structural homolog to DhAHP is the PrxD
(Type Ii) of Populus tremula (PDB:1TP9A) (data not
shown), which contains two cysteine residues. Though
poplar Prx contains two conserved cysteine residues, it is
assumed to function as a 1-Cys Prx because site-directed
mutagenesis has demonstrated that only the catalytic
cysteine of the poplar Prx is essential for hydroperoxide
reduction [31]. Previously, the type II TPx from S. cerevisiae was reported to contain three Cys residues at positions
31, 62 and 120, and its disulfide linkage is between 62
and 120 and Cys-31 has no effect on TPx activity [32].
Though structural and sequence analyses of the deduced
protein indicate that DhAhp contains 2 Cys residues at
positions 24 and 54, the multiple sequence alignment of
Ahps identifies the conserved Cys-54 as the peroxidative
cysteine (Fig. 3). The role of Cys-24 in D. hansenii Ahp
remains to be explored in the future. Therefore, DhAhp is
clearly a member of the disulfide oxidoreductases and can
be considered a 1-Cys Prx.
Regulation of expression of DhAHP
Alkyl hydroperoxide reductases have been identified previously as oxidative stress proteins in Salmonella typhimurium [33] and Bacillus subtilis [23] and their expression is
known to be upregulated by oxidative factors. However,
the finding of an extensive accumulation of Ahp in the
halophilic yeast D. hansenii by salt is reported for the first
time in this study. Consistently, overexpression of D.
hansenii Ahp in D. hansenii (Fig. 7) and in the two salt-sensitive yeasts S. cerevisiae and P. methanolica (Fig. 8 and 9)
further increases their tolerance to salt. On the contrary,
suppression of its expression in D. hansenii resulted in a
lower tolerance to salinity (Fig. 6). Clearly, the results suggest that DhAHP is induced by salt and its expression confers the high salt tolerance in D. hansenii. A previous study
also revealed that the expression of a homolog to the
Escherichia coli Ahp is induced by osmotic shock in Staphylococcus aureus [34]. Similarly, the expression of Ahp in
Shewanella putrefaciens is accompanied by accumulation
of the corresponding transcript under NaCl stress [35] and
the activity of the alkyl hydroperoxidase enzyme is
dependent on salt concentration [36]. Collectively, the
results from these studies indicate that expression of Ahps
in general is upregulated not only by oxidative factors but
also by other stresses, such as drought and salinity.

Hydrogen peroxide level is known to increase within the
cell in response to various stress factors and act as an intracellular messenger for induction of genes related to
defense against oxidative environments [37]. Treatment
of cells with hydrogen peroxide mimics stress and induces
defense signaling by activating mitogen-activated protein
kinase and stimulates cell growth [38]. The ROS levels of
D. hansenii, S. cerevisiae and P. methanolica also increase in
response to salt and methanol treatments, and the degrees

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/182

of increase are more pronounced in the two salt-sensitive
yeast species than the halophilic D. hansenii (Fig. 11). Furthermore, the DhAHP overexpression transformants of
these species have reduced amounts of ROS accumulated
than their wild type strains, indicating the protective role
of Ahp. These results are in agreement with the earlier
observations that Ahp genes play an important role in peroxide resistance in Bacillus subtilis [23], Clostridium pasteurianum [24], Burkholderia cenocepacia [25], Shewanella
putrefaciens [35] and Porphyromonas gingivalis [39] under
various stress conditions (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, high/
low temperature and high/low pH). Therefore, the
induced expression and accumulation of DhAhp in saline
environments to detoxify ROS is a very important survival
mechanism for this halophilic organism.

Conclusion
In summary, the Ahp gene isolated from the extremely
halophilic yeast D. hansenii under salt stress in this study
is a new gene relative to its salt tolerance mechanism. It is
rapidly induced and accumulates to large quantities in D.
hansenii to reduce accumulation of ROS. Molecular characterization shows that DhAhp, a cytosolic protein,
belongs to the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase of the 1-Cys
type peroxiredoxin family. The DhAhp and C. albicans
Ahp11 have a common ancestry but show divergent evolution. Silencing of its expression by RNA interference
resulted in decreased tolerance to salt stress. On the other
hand, overexpression of the DhAHP in D. hansenii and the
two salt-sensitive yeasts S. cerevisiae and P. methanolica
conferred enhanced tolerance to salt with reduced accumulation of ROS. Clearly, the multiple activities (peroxidase, chaperone, redox signaling) possessed by Ahps are
essential for its central role in protecting the cellular
metabolism of yeast against ROS built-up under stress
conditions. Compared with the two salt-sensitive yeasts,
the extreme halotolerance exhibited by D. hansenii may be
due to its ability to scavenge ROS by Ahp. Thus, the results
of this study contribute to our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms by which the extremely halophilic yeast D. hansenii adapts to high salt. Manipulation
of antioxidant enzymes in industrial microorganisms, as
demonstrated in S. cerevisiae and P. methanolica in this
study, or crops may bring about enhanced growth and
production of useful products under adverse culture conditions. Overexpressing enzymes involved in redox reaction in crops, such as superoxide dismutase [40] and
glutathione peroxidase [41] has resulted in enhanced tolerance to salt and other stress.

Subtractive hybridization and construction of subtracted
cDNA library
Subtractive hybridization was performed using PCR-select
cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.).
For screening of differentially upregulated genes, cDNA
synthesized from the 2.5 M NaCl treated yeast cells for 24
min was used as the tester while that from non-treated
cells served as the driver. The PCR products of forward
subtraction were subcloned into the pGEMR-T Easy Vector (Promega, USA). Competent cells of E. coli (XL-Blue)
was transfected with the plasmids and grown on LB-agar
medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-dgalactoside (X-gal) (Sigma, U.S.A.), isopropyl Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Sigma, U.S.A.) and ampicillin. Individual white colonies with insert DNA were
randomly picked for further analysis.
Sequencing and sequence analysis
White clones from the forward subtractive hybridization
libraries were sequenced with the universal T7 or SP6
sequencing primers using an automatic DNA sequencer
(3100 Genetic Analyzer, ABI, U.S.A). All inserted
sequences were queried for similarity through the NCBI
database using BLASTX sequence comparison software
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST.
Quantification of DhAHP by quantitative real-time PCR
(Q-RT-PCR)
Total RNA isolated from yeast cells treated with NaCl for
various time intervals was first treated with DNase I
(Promega, U.S.A.) to remove DNA contamination before
cDNA synthesis [43]. cDNA was synthesized using High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (P/N 4368814,

Real-time PCR assay was carried out in an ABI PRISM
7500 Sequence Detection System (ABI, U.S.A.). The
amplification of the target genes was monitored every
cycle by SYBR-Green fluorescence.
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
The full-lengthed cDNA clone of DhAHP was obtained by
rapid amplification of the cDNA ends using the GeneRacerTM Kit (Invitrogen, U.S.A.), as described in the manual
provided by the manufacturer. The forward and reverse
gene specific primers (GSPs) used for RACE were designed
based on the DhAHP cDNA sequence. The universal primers for 5' and 3' Race were GeneRace 5' and GeneRace 3',
respectively, provided in the kit. After PCR the DNA fragments were cloned into pGEMR-T Easy vector (Promega,
U.S.A.) for sequencing.

Bioinformatics analysis
The deduced amino acid sequence of DhAHP was analyzed with the Expert Protein Analysis System http://
www.expasy.org/. Multiple sequence alignment was performed for sequence comparison and alignment of D.
hansenii Ahp and two other reported AHPs (Swiss-Prot:
P38013 and Q5AF44) from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans
and peroxisomal membrane protein (Swiss-Prot:
O14313) from S. pombe and three other structural
homolog proteins (Swiss-Prot:Q8S3L0, B3GV28 and

P30044) from P. tremula, P. sativum and H. sapiens. The
alignment and phylogenetic analysis were carried out by
the protein sequence alignment program CLUSTAL W.
Southern and northern hybridization analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from yeast cells by the
method of Hoffman and Winston [44]. Southern and
northern hybridization analyses were performed using the
DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit
(Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). For Southern hybridization, 20 Î¼g genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI and
BamHI and electrophoretically separated on 0.7% (w/v)
agarose gels in TBE buffer and DNA fragments blotted
onto nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
U.K.) by 20ÃSSC. The full-lengthed DhAHP DNA was
labeled and used as a hybridization probe. For nothern
hybridization analysis, RNA was extracted from D. hansenii that was not treated or treated with 2.5 M NaCl for 16
min, separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde gels,
blotted onto nylon membrane and hybridized with
labeled DhAHP DNA, as described above for Southern
analysis.
Silencing of DhAHP expression in D. hansenii by RNA
interference
To test the function of DhAHP, RNA interference was
employed to suppress its expression in D. hansenii using
the Knockout RNAi System Kit (Clontech, U.S.A.), as
described in the manual by the manufacturer. The oligonucleotide sequences including BamHI and EcoRI sites,
target sense sequence, hairpin loop, target antisense
sequence and terminator were shown as follow.

BamHI Target sense sequence Hairpin loop Target antisense
sequence Terminator

3'-GCTGTATAAGGGCTAATAAACAAGTTCTCTGTTTATTAGCCCTTATACAAAAAAACTTAA-3' EcoRI
A chemical method based on LiCl, as described by Tarutina and Tolstorukov [45], was used to transfect D. hansenii and the RNAi transformant was screened by its poor
ability to grow on YM11 solid media containing 2.5 M
NaCl. The transformant was confirmed by sequencing the
introduced DNA fragment in the genome with specific
primers and by Q-RT-PCR.
Overexpression of DhAHP in D. hansenii, S. cerevisiae
and P. methanolica
To further test its functional role in relation to salt tolerance, DhAHP was overexpressed in three yeast species
with contrasting degrees of salt tolerance. The entire ORF

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/182

of DhAHP was first amplified by PCR utilizing the overexpression 5' primer, which introduced an EcoRI site in front
of the starting ATG codon, and the overepression 3'
primer, which introduced a BamHI site before the stop
codon. This DNA fragment was inserted into the expression vector of pMETB (Invitrogen, U.S.A.). The plasmid
DNA of the DhAHP/pMETB veector was digested with Pst
I to release the PAUG1/DhAHP expression cassette, which
was then introduced into D. hansenii, S. cerevisiae and P.
methanolica by a chemical method based on LiCl, as
described by Tarutina and Tolstorukov [45]. The AUG1
sequence is a methanol inducible promoter to drive the
expression of introduced DhAHP. Functional complementation was used to screen transformants from the
three species by culture on solid media containing 0.5%
methanol and higher NaCl concentrations than they can
normally tolerate. For isolation of D. hansenii overexpression transformants YM medium containing 3.5 M NaCl
was used, for S. cerevisiae transformants YPD medium
containing 1.5 M NaCl was used and for P. methanolica
transformants YPAD medium containing 2.0 M NaCl was
adopted. The transformants were confirmed by sequencing the PAUG1 DNA fragment in the genome with specific
primers and by Q-RT-PCR with cells grown under high
salt in the presence or absence of methanol. The ability of
the selected transformants to tolerate salt was further
assessed by growing in liquid media containing high NaCl
concentrations.
Measurement of intracellular ROS
For measurement of cellular ROS, the redox-sensitive fluorescent probe 2', 7'-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate
(DCFA-DA) (Sigma, U.S.A.) was used according to Chattopadhyay et al. [46]. The cells of wild type strains and
DhAHP overexpression transformants were grown in
appropriate liquid media without any salt for approximately 36 h (1 O.D. at 600 nm) and switched to fresh
media containing high NaCl (3.5 M for D. hansenii, 2.0 M
for S. cerevisiae and 2.5 M for P. methanolica) with or without methanol for 5 h. To determine ROS, cells were harvested by centrifugation and treated with 10 Î¼M DCFA for
30 min at 30Â°C. The cells were re-suspended and washed
in water and extracted by vortexing with glass beads.
Extracts were centrifuged and fluorescence in the supernatant was measured with Î»EX = 485 nm and Î»EM = 524 nm
in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Infinite F200). Fluorescence signals were expressed relative to that of the
wild type strain before any stress treatments (fold over
control).
