Abstract
Background: Plants grown under iron deficiency show different morphological, biochemical and physiological
changes. These changes include, among others, the elicitation of different strategies to improve the acquisition of Fe
from the rhizosphere, the adjustment of Fe homeostasis processes and a reorganization of carbohydrate metabolism.
The application of modern techniques that allow the simultaneous and untargeted analysis of multiple proteins and
metabolites can provide insight into multiple processes taking place in plants under Fe deficiency. The objective of this
study was to characterize the changes induced in the root tip proteome and metabolome of sugar beet plants in
response to Fe deficiency and resupply.
Results: Root tip extract proteome maps were obtained by 2-D isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, and approximately 140 spots were detected. Iron deficiency resulted in changes in the relative
amounts of 61 polypeptides, and 22 of them were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Metabolites in root tip
extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-MS, and more than 300 metabolites were resolved. Out of 77 identified
metabolites, 26 changed significantly with Fe deficiency. Iron deficiency induced increases in the relative amounts of
proteins and metabolites associated to glycolysis, tri-carboxylic acid cycle and anaerobic respiration, confirming
previous studies. Furthermore, a protein not present in Fe-sufficient roots, dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (DMRL) synthase,
was present in high amounts in root tips from Fe-deficient sugar beet plants and gene transcript levels were higher in
Fe-deficient root tips. Also, a marked increase in the relative amounts of the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs)
was observed in Fe-deficient plants, and a further increase in these compounds occurred upon short term Fe resupply.
Conclusions: The increases in DMRL synthase and in RFO sugars were the major changes induced by Fe deficiency
and resupply in root tips of sugar beet plants. Flavin synthesis could be involved in Fe uptake, whereas RFO sugars
could be involved in the alleviation of oxidative stress, C trafficking or cell signalling. Our data also confirm the increase
in proteins and metabolites related to carbohydrate metabolism and TCA cycle pathways.
Background
Two different strategies of Fe uptake have been described
in plants. The so-called chelation strategy (or Strategy II),
which is mainly found in graminaceous plants, is based
on the excretion of phytosideropores (PS) to the rhizosphere. Phytosideropores rapidly chelate Fe(III), to form
Fe(III)-PS chelates that are subsequently transported into

the root cells through a specific transporter. The socalled reduction strategy (or Strategy I) relies on the coordinated action of a membrane bound Fe reductase, that
reduces Fe(III) to Fe(II) [1], an Fe(II) uptake transporter
[2] and an H+ -ATPase that lowers the pH of the rhizosphere [3], is mainly used by non graminaceous plants,
including Beta vulgaris. The reduction strategy includes
root morphological, physiological and biochemical
changes that lead to an increased capacity for Fe uptake.
Morphological changes include root tip swelling, development of transfer cells and an increase in the number of

lateral roots, leading to an increase in the root surface in
contact with the medium [4].
Some plants are able to accumulate and/or release both
reducing and chelating substances, such as phenolics and
flavins, which may have a role in Fe acquisition [5,6]. Iron
has been shown to down-regulate riboflavin (Rbfl) synthesis in flavinogenic yeast strains and some bacteria
[7,8]. In plants, Rbfl and derivatives are accumulated and/
or excreted in Fe-deficient roots and could act as a redox
bridge for electron transport to the Fe(III) reductase [9].
Moreover, FRO2 belongs to a superfamily of flavocytochrome oxidoreductases [1], and a recent study confirmed that the FRO2 protein contains FAD sequence
motifs on the inside of the membrane [10]. Also, a connection between Fe deficiency perception and Rbfl excretion has been described to occur through basic helixloop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in Arabidopsis
thaliana [11].
At the metabolic level, increases in the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and several
enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle have been found in different plant species grown under Fe deficiency [12,13]. Transcriptomic
[14] and proteomic studies in Fe deficient plants [15-17]
have also reported increases in root transcript and protein abundances, respectively, of enzymes related to the
glycolytic and TCA cycle pathways, among others. Iron
deficiency also induces an accumulation of organic acids,
mainly malate and citrate, in roots [12]. The induction of
C metabolism in roots of Fe-deficient plants would not
only provide a source of reducing power, protons and
ATP for the Fe(III) reductase and H+-ATPase enzymes,
but also lead to an anaplerotic root C fixation [18,19].
Carbon accumulated in roots is exported in the form of
organic acids via xylem [18,20,21] to leaves [22], which
have otherwise drastically reduced photosynthetic rates
when Fe-deficient. The higher energy requirements in Fedeficient root cells are tackled by increasing mitochondrial oxidative processes, and roots from Fe-deficient
plants show enhanced respiratory activities and higher
O2 consumption rates [9,23]. On the other hand, the
mitochondrial respiratory chain is strongly affected
under Fe-deficient conditions [23,24], since some of its
components are Fe-containing enzymes. Iron deficiency
leads to an enhancement of different ROS detoxification
strategies [25]. Furthermore, an increase in anaerobic
metabolism has also been described in Fe-deficient roots
[9], probably as an strategy to oxidize all the reducing
power generated by glycolysis and TCA cycle that can not
be easily oxidized in the respiratory chain. When resupplied with Fe, Fe-deficient plants reorganize its metabolism by readjusting metabolic cycles and changing root
morphology towards those typical of Fe-sufficient plants
[21,26].

The most common approach used to study Fe deficiency in roots is to analyze only a small number of genes,
proteins and/or metabolites. A more comprehensive
knowledge of the processes taking place in Fe-deficient
roots has been recently provided by the application of
modern techniques allowing for the simultaneous and
untargeted analysis of multiple genes or proteins [14-17].
The aim of this work was to characterize the changes
induced in the root tip proteome and metabolome of
sugar beet plants in response to Fe deficiency and resupply, in order to provide a holistic view of the metabolic
processes occurring in plants under different Fe status.

Results
IEF-PAGE electrophoresis

The polypeptide pattern of root tip extracts was obtained
by 2-D IEF-SDS PAGE electrophoresis. Real scans of typical 2-D gels are shown in Figure 1; an average number of
141 and 148 polypeptides were detected in Fe-sufficient
and Fe-deficient plants, respectively (Figure 1A and 1B).
The total number of spots detected was relatively low
when compared to other proteomic studies [16,17]. Several causes may account for this discrepancy, including i)
protein extraction method and amount of protein loaded
in the gels, ii) gel size, iii) pI range and iv) sensitivity of
the staining method. Averaged 2-D polypeptide maps
were obtained using gels of three independent preparations, each from a different batch of plants (gels obtained
with different root tip extract preparations isolated from
different batches of plants were very similar; data not
shown). To better describe polypeptide changes we built
a composite averaged virtual map containing all spots
present in both Fe-deficient and control root tip extracts
(Figure 1C and 1D). Iron deficiency caused 2-fold
increases in 29 spots (yellow marks in Figure 1C, p < 0.10
student t-test) and 2-fold decreases in signal intensity in
13 spots (green marks in Figure 1C, p < 0.10 student ttest).
Furthermore, 6 spots were only detected in Fe-sufficient plant samples (blue marks in Figure 1C) and 13
spots were only detected in Fe-deficient plants (red marks
in Figure 1C). All polypeptides in the composite averaged
map are depicted again in Figure 1D, to permit annotation of those polypeptides where identification was
achieved by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight MS (MALDI TOF; marked by squares in
Figure 1D). These polypeptides were labeled from a to v
as described in Figure 1D, and homologies found are
described in detail in Table 1.
From the 29 spots that showed increases in signal in
root tip extracts of Fe-deficient as compared to Fe-sufficient controls, the 20 more abundant were excised and
analyzed by MALDI-MS. Since the sugar beet genome
has not been sequenced yet and few sequences are avail-

Figure 1 2-D IEF-SDS PAGE proteome maps of root tips from Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient Beta vulgaris plants. Proteins were separated in
the first dimension in linear (pH 5-8) IPG gel strips and in the second dimension in 12% acrylamide vertical gels. Scans of real typical gels of root tips
from Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient plants are shown in A and B, respectively. Virtual composite images, showing all polypeptides present in root tips
from Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient plants are shown in panels C and D. Statistical significance was assessed with a t-test (p < 0.10), and a 2-fold change
in spot intensity between treatments was used as a threshold. Only spots that fit both criteria are marked in panel C; spots whose intensities decrease
or disappear completely with Fe deficiency were labelled with green and blue marks, respectively, and those increasing with Fe deficiency or only
present in Fe-deficient gels were labelled with yellow and red marks, respectively. In panel D, polypeptides that had significant homologies with proteins in the databases (using MALDI-MS and MASCOT) are marked by squares and labelled with lower-case letters. Homologies are described in detail
in Table 1.

able in the databases, identification was performed by
homology searches with proteins from other plant species. From the 20 spots analyzed, 14 proteins were identified (proteins labeled a to n in Figure 1D and Table 1).
These include proteins related to glycolysis such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (spot a), triose-phosphate
isomerase (spot b), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (spot c)
and enolase (spots d and e, respectively). Three spots gave
significant matches to malate dehydrogenase (MDH;
spots f-h), and two more polypeptides presented homology with α and β subunits from F1 ATP synthase (spots i
and j). Other proteins increasing in root tip extracts from
Fe-deficient sugar beet plants as compared to the controls

were fructokinase (spot k) and formate dehydrogenase
(spot l). Also, one spot gave significant matches to a cytosolic peptidase At1g79210/YUP8H12R_1 (spot m). Spot n
gave significant match to a glycine rich protein, which
possibly has a role in RNA transcription or processing
during stress conditions.
From the 13 spots detected de novo in proteome maps
from root tip extracts of Fe-deficient plants (Figure 1C),
the 6 more abundant were excised and analyzed by
MALDI-MS, resulting in only 2 positive matches (spots o
and p in Figure 1D and Additional file 1). These significant matches were found for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GADPH; spot o) and DMRL (spot p).

Scores (equal to -10*Log P, P being the probability that the observed match is a random event) are based on:
Peptide mass fingerprint
data, with protein scores >76 being statistically significant (p < 0.05), and (2)MS2 ion sequencing data, with individual ion scores > 40 indicating
identity or extensive homology (p < 0.05). In both cases, protein scores are derived from ion scores as a non-probabilistic basis for ranking protein
hits. Proteins are separated in different groups depending on whether they increased, decreased, appeared (new) or disappeared (missing) when
compared to control plants.

Changes in the amount of DMRL as well as DMRL gene
expression and flavin analysis were further studied using
root tip extracts of Fe-sufficient, Fe-deficient and Feresupplied sugar beet plants (see below).
From the 13 spots showing a decrease in signal intensity in root tip extracts from Fe-deficient plants as com-

pared to controls (Figure 1C), 3 were identified by
MALDI-MS. Spots q and r (Figure 1D, Table 1) gave a significant match to nucleoside diphosphate kinase I and to
oxalate oxidase-like germin, respectively. Spot s presented homology with the At4g27270 protein (Figure 1D)

whose molecular function is to interact selectively with
FMN, and also presents oxidoreductase activity.
From the 6 spots not detected in root tip extracts from
Fe-deficient plants as compared to the controls (Figure
1C), 3 were identified by MALDI-MS (spots t-v in Figure
1D and Additional file 1). Proteins matched were oxalate
oxidase (spot t), peroxidase (spot u) and caffeoyl CoA Ometyltransferase (spot v).
DMRL synthase gene expression analysis

To identify a putative DMRL synthase cDNA in B. vulgaris, primers were designed based on DMRL synthase
sequence from the closely related specie S. oleracea
(AF147203.1). A PCR product of approximately 675 bp
was amplified, purified and sequenced (Additional file
2A). The translated amino acid sequence for the DMRL
synthase putative ORF had 224 aminoacids, a predicted
MW of 23.7 kDa and a pI of 8.26. The predicted protein
displayed 90% identity at the amino acid level with S. oleracea DMRL (AAD44808.1), and homologies with other
known DMRLs sequences included in the alignment
analysis ranged from 50 to 56% (Additional file 2B). Thus,
we have assigned the name BvDMRL to the corresponding DMRL synthase gene of B. vulgaris, and the sequence
has been deposited in GenBank as accession GQ375163.
Transcriptional regulation by Fe status of the BvDMRL
gene was assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. BvDMRL transcript abundance was much higher in root tips
from Fe-deficient as compared to control plants (Figure
2A). The expression of BvDMRL was drastically reduced
24 h after Fe-resupply to Fe-deficient plants (Figure 2A)
but it was still higher than that observed in Fe-sufficient
root tips. However, transcript abundance in root tips
sampled 72 h after Fe-resupply, which showed two different zones (white -WZ- and yellow -YZ-, see [26]), had a
low expression level, similar to that measured in Fe-sufficient plants (Figure 2A).
DMRL synthase protein analysis

Real scans of the 2-D gel zone where DMRL synthase
protein is located (16 kDa, pI 6.6) are shown in Figure 2B.
The DMRL synthase protein was detected not only in Fedeficient root tip extracts but also in extracts of root tip
YZ from plants resupplied with Fe for 24 and 72 h (Figure
2B). Conversely, DMRL synthase was not detected in
extracts of the new WZ of root tips from plants 72 h after
Fe resupply, or in Fe-sufficient root tip extracts (Figure
2B).
Flavin concentrations

Since DMRL synthase is one of the key enzymes in flavin
synthesis, we also examined flavin concentrations in root
tip extracts from Fe-sufficient, Fe-deficient and Fe-resupplied plants by high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). Riboflavin, FAD and Rbfl sulphates were found

gels containing the BvDMRL protein (B) and riboflavin sulphates (C)

YZ and 72 h Fe-resupplied WZ. Letters in (C) and (D) indicate significant
differences (n = 6, p < 0.05, Duncan test).

in Fe-deficient and Fe-resupplied root tip YZ extracts.
Riboflavin sulphates and Rbfl account for 98% and 2% of
the total flavin concentration, respectively, and only
traces of FAD were found. Rbfl sulphate concentrations
were 319, 384 and 488 nmol g-1 FW in the root YZ of Fedeficient plants and 24 h and 72 h Fe-resupplied plants,
respectively (Figure 2C). Riboflavin concentration ranged
from 1.1 to 2.3 nmol g-1 FW in root YZ (Figure 2D). Only
traces of these compounds were present either in controls
or in the WZ of 72 h Fe-resupplied plants.
Metabolite Analyses

Changes induced by Fe-deficiency and Fe-resupply in the
root tip metabolome were evaluated by non-biased gas
chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolite
profiling. A total of 326 metabolites were present in at
least 80% of the samples of at least one treatment, and 77
of them were identified. Partial least square analysis
shows a good separation between +Fe and -Fe root tips
(Figure 3). Iron-deficient samples were closer to the 24 h
and 72 h YZ samples than to the 72 h WZ ones. On the
other hand, the 72 h WZ samples were closer to the +Fe
samples than to the -Fe ones.

Rellán-Álvarez et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/120

Iron deficiency and/or resupply caused significant
changes (p < 0.05) in the levels of 62 out of the 77 identified metabolites. Metabolite level data were normalized
to the mean response of the +Fe treatment; response
ratios, defined as the level in a given treatment divided by
the level in the +Fe control, are indicated in Table 2. Iron
deficiency caused significant changes in the response
ratios of 26 metabolites. Large (> 4-fold) increases were
found for some organic acids (citric and aconitic acid),
some sugars (sucrose, myo-inositol and those of the
raffinose family of oligosaccharides -RFOs-, namely
galactinol and raffinose), nicotianamine and 2-aminoadipic acid. The response ratio of oxalic acid decreased
markedly in -Fe conditions, whereas those of other aminoacids, N compounds, lipid metabolites and others did
not show large (> 4-fold) changes when compared to the
Fe-sufficient controls.
Twenty-four hours after Fe-resupply, there was a dramatic coordinated increase in the root tip response ratios
of galactinol, raffinose, lactobionic acid, cellobiose and
nicotianamine when compared to those found in Fe-deficient roots, whereas the response ratios of sucrose, myoinositol, citrate and malate decreased. Seventy-two hours
after Fe resupply, the response ratios of galactinol,
raffinose, cellobiose, nicotianamine and many other compounds had decreased in the YZ areas, whereas in the
WZ the response ratios were very low. The response ratio
of many of the lipids increased moderately in all Fe resupplied samples. Metabolites in the coenzyme, glycolysis,
oxidative stress, pentose phosphate pathway and signalling categories did not show large response ratio changes
with Fe resupply.

Regarding the unknown metabolites, significant
changes (at p < 0.01, with response ratios > 4) were found
for 46 of the 269 metabolites with Fe deficiency and/or
resupply (Additional file 1). BinBase metabolite ID
211891 showed the largest response ratio (18, 146 and 70fold, for -Fe, 24 h and 72 h YZ, respectively). The
response of this metabolite to Fe status was very similar
to that found for the RFOs, and in fact its mass spectra
and retention index show a good similarity in BinBase to
those of other disaccharides such as leucrose, suggesting
that it could be a RFO related compound (to see 211891
mass spectra, go to http://eros.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu:8080
/binbase-compound/, select the rtx5 database and type
211891).
Raffinose and galactinol concentrations

The concentrations of raffinose and galactinol in root tips
were determined by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC-MS. Raffinose concentrations were 35.1,
50.4, 35.4, 80.8 and 4.2 nmol g FW-1 in the -Fe, 24h, 72h
WZ, 72h YZ and +Fe tissues, respectively. Galactinol concentrations were 75.6, 39.8, 16.1, 37.1 and 7.6 nmol g FW1 in the -Fe, 24h, 72h WZ, 72h YZ and +Fe tissues, respectively.

Discussion
The changes induced by Fe deficiency in the root tip proteome and metabolome from sugar beet plants grown in
hydroponics have been studied. More than 140 proteins
(Figure 1) and 300 metabolites (Table 2 and Additional
file 1) were resolved in sugar beet root tip extracts. Iron
deficiency resulted in significant and higher than 2-fold
changes in the relative amounts of 61 polypeptides, and
22 of them were identified. Out of 77 identified metabolites, 26 changed significantly with Fe deficiency. In general, our results are in agreement with previous
transcriptomic [14], proteomic [15-17] and enzymatic
[19] studies on Fe-deficient roots. Our data confirm the
increases previously found in proteins and metabolites
related to carbohydrate metabolism and TCA cycle pathways [9,13,27]. Two major changes induced by Fe deficiency in roots are described in this study for the first
time: the increase in DMRL synthase protein concentration and gene expression, and the increase in RFO sugars.
The largest change found in the proteome map of root
tip extracts from sugar beet plants grown in Fe deficiency
conditions corresponded to DMRL synthase, which was
detected de novo in Fe-deficient root tips, and is the protein with the highest concentration in these gels (spot p in
Figure 1D). This enzyme catalyses the fourth step of Rbfl
biosynthesis, and Rbfl is the precursor of Rbfl sulphates,
FMN and FAD, the last one being a cofactor for the root
plasma membrane Fe reductase [10]. The expression of
BvDMRL decreased drastically 24 h after the addition of

When the response ratio (level in a given treatment divided by the level in the +Fe treatment) was lower than 1 the inverse was taken and the

Fe to Fe-deficient plants, whereas DMRL synthase protein abundance and Rbfl and Rbfl sulphate concentrations did not change significantly with Fe-resupply in the
YZ of root tips (Figure 2), suggesting that the turnover of
this protein is slow. Accumulation in Fe-deficient roots of
flavin compounds, including Rbfl and Rbfl 3' - and 5'-sulphate is a characteristic response of sugar beet and other
plant species [6]. The exact role of flavins in Fe deficiency
is unknown, and it has been hypothesized, based on the
similar location of flavin accumulation and Fe reduction
and on the fact that the Fe reductase is a flavin-containing
protein, that free flavin accumulation may be an integral
part of the Fe-reducing system in roots from Strategy I
plants [9,28]. On the other hand, these compounds are
secreted to the growth media at low pH [6] and, assuming
high concentrations at the secretion site, they could
mediate extracellular electron transfer between soil Fe
deposits and root Fe reductase as it has been described
for flavin phosphates secreted by some bacteria [29].
Moreover, excreted flavins could also act as a plant-gen-

erated signal that could influence rhizosphere microbial
populations, indirectly affecting Fe availability [11].
A major change in carbohydrate metabolism was the
large increase in RFO compounds (34- to 16-fold changes
in the response ratios of galactinol and raffinose, respectively; Table 2) that occurs in roots with Fe deficiency.
This increase was higher than that found for sucrose (5fold). The total concentrations of raffinose and galactinol
were also determined by HPLC-MS, and concentrations
of both compounds in the 35-80 nmol g FW-1 range were
found in Fe-deficient and Fe-resupplied root tips (equivalent to approximately 50 μM), whereas concentrations in
the +Fe treatment were one order of magnitude lower.
The sum of the raffinose and galactinol concentrations in
the -Fe, 24h, 72hWZ, 72hYZ and +Fe tissues was 13.9, 7.4,
2.2, 5.1 and 0.6% of the total sucrose, respectively, supporting the relevance of the RFOs changes with Fe status.
RFOs have diverse roles in plants, including transport
and storage of C [30] and acting as compatible solutes for
protection in abiotic stresses [31,32]. Other explanation

Rellán-Álvarez et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/120

for the large increase in the relative amounts of RFOs
could be the ability to function as antioxidants [33,34];
galactinol and raffinose have hydroxyl radical scavenging
activities similar to other soluble antioxidants such as
glutathione and ascorbic acid [33]. Since ROS damage
and ROS detoxification strategies have been observed in
Fe-deficient roots [25,35], the increase in RFO concentration could help to alleviate ROS damage produced under
Fe deficiency. Moderate increases in sugars commonly
found in cell walls such as cellobiose, xylonic acid and
arabinose, which may indicate cell wall modifications,
were measured in sugar beet Fe-deficient root tips.
Changes in cell wall metabolism have been also described
in Fe-deficient tomato roots [16]. On the other hand, it
has been described that cell wall damage generates oligosaccharides that can act as signalling molecules in
stresses such as wounding [36]. The increase in RFOs
could also act as a long distance Fe-deficiency signal via
phloem sap transport. This is the first description of
RFOs accumulation in plants under Fe deficiency, and the
physiological implications of this increase deserve further
consideration.
Most of the proteins found to be up-accumulated in
sugar beet root tips by Fe deficiency were identified as
carbohydrate catabolism enzymes, including 5 of the 10
glycolytic pathway enzymes (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase
and enolase), one of the citric acid cycle (MDH) and fructokinase. Increases in the activities and concentrations of
several glycolytic enzymes in root extracts with Fe deficiency have been previously found, including fructose
1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, enolase, triosephosphate
isomerase and GADPH [15,16,37-39]. Also, increases in
the activities and concentrations of several enzymes of
the citric acid cycle with Fe deficiency have been previously reported in root extracts, including MDH [9,16,38].
Results are also in agreement with microarray gene analysis in Fe-deficient A. thaliana roots [14]. Increases in the
amount of PEPC have been found at the protein level
[16,40,41], but this enzyme, with a molecular mass of 110
kDa, was not in the range (apparent molecular mass 10100 kDa) used in our 2-D gels. Up-regulation of carbohydrate catabolism in roots of plants grown in Fe deficient
conditions is probably a result of an increased demand of
energy and reducing power in roots needed to sustain the
increased activity of H+-ATPase and Fe reductase
[14,16,19]. Also, two spots corresponding to different
subunits of F1 ATP synthase increased in 2-D gels from
Fe deficient root tips, further supporting the higher
energy requirement in these roots. Moreover, our results
show an increase in the amount of formate dehydrogenase, an enzyme related to the anaerobic respiration, in
Fe-deficient roots, confirming the results of enzyme [9]

Page 10 of 15

and transcriptional [14] analysis. Anaerobic respiration is
an alternative pathway for energy production when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired.
Metabolite studies revealed large increases in organic
acids, including a 20-fold citric acid increase. These
increases in TCA cycle organic acids with Fe deficiency
are coupled with increases in glycolysis [9,16] and root C
fixation by PEPC [40,41], and provide an anaplerotic,
non-autotrophic (via xylem) C source for leaves which
have otherwise reduced photosynthetic rates [18,22].
Malate and citrate could also be pumped from the cytosol
to the mitochondria via a di-tricarboxylate carrier (DTC)
where they would allow a higher turnover of reducing
equivalents [23]. A significant decrease (-10.9) in oxalic
acid concentration was observed in Fe deficient root tips,
and similar decreases (ca. 10 times) have been reported in
Fe-deficient tomato roots [13]. The implications of
oxalate concentration decreases with Fe deficiency are
still not known, since the role of oxalic acid in plants is
quite different from that of the other organic acids, and
for a long time it has been considered as a toxin or a metabolic end product [42]. Regarding N and amino-acid
compounds, a large increase (8-fold) was measured for
nicotianamine, which has been described to play a role in
cytosolic Fe availability [43,44].
A comprehensive representation of the metabolomic
and proteomic changes taking place in root tips under Fe
deficiency and resupply is shown in Figure 4. Red and yellow symbols indicate major and moderate increases in
metabolites (squares) and proteins (circles) compared to
the Fe-sufficient controls. Blue and green symbols indicate major and moderate decreases in metabolites
(squares) and proteins (circles) compared to the controls.
Besides the major increases in RFOs and DMRL, Fe deficiency induced significant changes in root tip metabolism, mainly associated to increases in carbohydrate
catabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle and to a lesser
extent in aminoacid and nitrogen metabolism (Figure 4).
Similar changes were observed in the 24 and 72h YZ Feresupplied roots, whereas the WZ of 72 h Fe-resupplied
plants did not show major changes when compared to
+Fe plants (Figure 4). On the other hand, the relative
amount of lipid metabolism compounds did not change
markedly in Fe-deficient roots, whereas Fe resupply
caused a moderate increase in this type of metabolites
(Figure 4).

Conclusions
The proteomic and metabolic profiles of root tips from
sugar beet plants were affected by Fe deficiency and
resupply. Changes in the glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolites and proteins confirmed previous studies. Two novel
and major findings were the increase in i) DMRL synthase protein concentration and gene expression, and ii)

Figure 4 Changes in metabolic pathways as affected by Fe status. Pathways related to metabolites and proteins were integrated according to
the KEGG database. Statistical t-student tests were performed to both protein and metabolite data to show statistically relevant changes between
samples. Red squares indicate metabolites showing significant, marked (more than 4-fold) up-accumulation compared to the controls, and yellow
ones mean significant, moderate (less than 4-fold) up-accumulation. Blue squares mean significant, marked (more than 4-fold) down-accumulation,
and green ones mean significant moderate (less than 4-fold) down-accumulation. The same colour code was used with proteins, represented by circles. Red circles are proteins detected only in Fe-deficient gels, and yellow ones mean significantly up-accumulated proteins using a 2-fold threshold.
Decreased (at least 50%) and missing proteins in the Fe-deficient treatment were represented in green and blue respectively. Each number or letter
corresponds to those shown in the corresponding protein and metabolite tables (Tables 1 and 2 respectively). Panels correspond to root tip extracts
from plants Fe-deficient (A), 24h after Fe resupply (B), and 72h after Fe resupply (YZ in panel C and WZ in panel D).

some RFO sugars (raffinose and galactinol). These new
findings give new perspectives to the knowledge of Fe
deficiency.

Methods
Plant Material

Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. "Monohil" and "Orbis" from
Hilleshög, Landskröna, Sweden and Syngenta, Madrid,
Spain, respectively) was grown as described elsewhere
[26]. "Monohil" was always used, with the exception of
raffinose and galactinol analysis, which was carried out
with "Orbis". After seed germination in vermiculite and 2
weeks in half-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution with
45 μM Fe(III)-EDTA, plants were transferred into 20 L
plastic buckets (four plants per bucket) containing halfstrength Hoagland's nutrient solution with either 0 or 45
μM Fe(III)-EDTA. The pH of the Fe-free nutrient solution was buffered at approximately 7.7 by adding 1 mM
NaOH and 1 g L-1 of CaCO3. In the Fe resupply experiments, plants grown for 10 d in the absence of Fe were
transferred to 20 L plastic buckets containing halfstrength Hoagland's nutrient solution, pH 5.5, with 45
μM Fe(III)-EDTA. The root subapical region from Fe-sufficient plants (+Fe), Fe-deficient plants (-Fe), Fe-deficient
plants resupplied with Fe for 24 h (24h) and Fe-deficient
plants resupplied with Fe for 72 h (72h) was collected
with a razor blade and immediately frozen in liquid N2.
The specific regions of root sampled were: in the case of
+Fe, -Fe and 24 h plants, the first 10 mm from the root
apex (+Fe roots were thin and white, whereas -Fe and 24
h roots were swollen and yellow); in the case of 72 h Fe
resupplied roots two zones were sampled separately, the
first 5 mm from the root apex, where a new white zone
had developed (72h WZ), and the next 5 mm, comprising
the still swollen and yellow root zone (72h WZ). Samples
were taken at approximately 4 h after light onset in the
growth chamber.
Protein extraction and analysis

Protein extracts were obtained as described elsewhere
[45] and protein concentration was measured with RC
DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A first
dimension isoelectric focusing (IEF) separation was carried out on ReadyStrip IPG Strips (BioRad), using a linear
pI gradient 5-8. Strips were loaded in a PROTEAN IEF
Cell (BioRad) and focused at 20°C, for a total of 14000
V.h. For the second dimension polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), IPG strips were placed onto
12% SDS-PAGE gels to separate proteins between 10 and
100 kDa. Proteins were stained with Coomassie-Blue R250 (Sigma, Barcelona, Spain) and results analyzed with
the PDQuest 8.0 software (BioRad) [46]. Gels were made
from independent root tip preparations from three different batches of plants. In-gel digestion, sample prepara-

tion, MALDI TOF and MALDI TOF-TOF peptide mass
fingerprint and database searching was carried out as
described in detail elsewhere [46]. Statistical significance
was tested with a t-Student test (p < 0.10). A 2-fold
change in spot signal intensity between treatments was
taken as a threshold.
Metabolite extraction, analysis, data processing and
statistical analysis

Metabolite extraction and analysis was carried out as
described previously [47]. Root tips (ca. 50 mg FW) from
eight different replicates per treatment (one plant each)
were used. After metabolite extraction and derivatization, samples (1 μL) were injected randomly in split-less
mode with a cold injection system (Gerstel, Mülheim an
der Ruhr, Germany) and analyzed by GC (Agilent 6890,
San Jose, CA, USA) using a Rtx 5Sil MS column (30 m x
0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) and an integrated guard
column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The GC was connected to a Leco Pegasus IV TOFMS spectrometer controlled with Leco ChromaTOF software v.2.32 (Leco, St.
Joseph, MI, USA). Initial peak detection and mass spectra
deconvolution were performed with Leco Chroma-TOF
software v.2.25. GC-MS chromatograms were processed
as described previously [47]. Further analysis after deconvolution was done using the semi-automated workflow in
the UC Davis Genome Center metabolomics laboratory
[48]. Metabolite data were normalized using FW and the
sum of all metabolite heights in a single run to account
for small FW and GC injection variations [47]. Statistical
analysis, including i) breakdown one-way ANOVA univariate statistics (p < 0.05), ii) multivariate analysis supervised partial least square (PLS) and iii) unsupervised
principal component analysis (PCA; data not shown)
were carried out with Statistica software (v.8.0. StatSoft,
Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). A 4-fold change in signal intensity
between treatments was taken as a threshold for discussion.
DMRLs gene identification and expression analysis

To identify putative dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (DMRL)
synthase gene sequences in sugar beet, searches were
performed with TBLASTX [49] using previously identified DMRL synthase sequences from A. thaliana
(AF148649.1), Nicotiana tabacum (AF422802.1) and
Spinacia oleracea (AF147203.1). Since the search gave no
hits in B. vulgaris, primers were designed based on the
DMRL synthase sequence from S. oleracea (AF147203.1),
the closest phylogenetically related species. Primers used
to amplify the complete cDNA sequence were f-ATGGCTTCATTTGCAGCTTCT and r-TTAGGCCTTCAA
ATGATGTTC.
Total RNA from Fe-deficient root tips was isolated
using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden,

Rellán-Álvarez et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/120

Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The concentrations of RNAs were assessed by ultraviolet
and visible absorption spectroscopy (UV/Vis). The structural integrity of the RNAs was checked with non-denaturing agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. A
sample aliquot containing 3 μg total RNA was subjected
to reverse transcription with 25 μg mL-1 oligo (dT)
primer, 0.05 mM dNTP mix and 1 unit of Superscript II
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) in a
final volume of 20 μL. PCR reactions were carried out
with 2 μL of resulting cDNA solution, using 0.5 μM of the
specific primers, 75 mM Tris HCl pH 9.0, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
50 mM KCl, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 200 μM dNTP's and 0.5
units DNA polymerase (Biotools, Madrid, Spain). PCR
cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 30
cycles consisting of 95°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s and 70°C
for 1 min, and a final period of 10 min at 70°C. The PCR
product was purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit
(Quiagen) and sequenced (CNIO, Madrid, Spain). The
nucleotide sequence was translated, MW and pI predicted by using the ExPASy server tools [50], and multiple-sequence alignments done with ClustalIW v.2 [51].
Expression of the DMRL gene in B. vulgaris root tips was
analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. One plant per
treatment was used to extract RNA, and two different
batches of plants were analyzed. RNA extraction and RTPCR reactions were carried out as described above.
Amplified products from 15 μl of PCR reaction were
visualized on 1% TBE agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide. Bands were photographed using the Quantity
One 4.5.1 Chemdoc EQ Software system (Bio-Rad). Actin
(DQ866829.1) was used as housekeeping gene. Primers
used to amplify the actin sequence were: f-GGCAAACAGGGAAAAGATGA and r-ACGACCAGCAAGATCCAAAC. RT-PCR reactions were carried twice for each
sample set.
Flavin analysis

Root material (ca. 100 mg FW) was frozen in liquid N2
and ground in a mortar with 0.1 M ammonium acetate,
pH 6.1. Extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 14000 g
and the supernatant stored at -80°C until analysis. Flavins
were determined by HPLC-UV/Vis as described by Susín
et al. [6]. Six samples per treatment from 3 independent
batches of plants were used for measurements.
Raffinose and galactinol analysis

Root tips (ca. 100 mg) from 3 different plants per treatment were extracted with 80% ethanol as described elsewhere [52]. After ethanol evaporation, extracts were
resuspended in acetonitrile-H2O and analyzed by HPLCMS as described in [53] with some modifications. Chromatographic separation was performed on an Alliance
2795 HPLC system (Waters, Mildford, MA, USA). The

autosampler was kept at 4°C and the column compartment temperature was set at 25°C. Injection volume was
10 μL, and a ZIC-pHILIC, 150 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm column
(Sequant, Umea, Sweden) was used with a flow rate of
200 μL min-1. The mobile phase was built using two eluents: A (5 mM ammonium acetate in 0.1% formic acid at
pH 4) and B (acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid). All mobile
phase chemicals were LC-MS grade (Riedel-de Haen,
Seelze, Germany). For separation, the initial solvent composition 90% B and 10% A was taken to 10% B and 90% A
with a 19 min linear gradient. Then, the mobile phase
returned to initial conditions in 1 min and these conditions were kept for another 10 min, to allow column
equilibration. Total run time per sample was 30 min. MS
analysis was carried out with a electrospray MS apparatus
(micrOTOF II, Bruker Daltoniks GmbH, Bremen, Germany) in the 50-1000 m/z range. The micrOTOF II was
operated in negative mode at 3000 and -500V capillary
and end-plate voltages, respectively. Capillary exit, skimmer 1 and hexapole RF voltages were set at -82.1, -41.4
and 80.0 V, respectively. Nebulizer gas (N2) pressure was
kept at 2.0 bar and drying gas (N2) flow was set at 8 L
min-1 with a temperature of 180°C. Mass calibration was
carried out with a 10 mM Li-formate solution using a
syringe pump (Cole-Parmer Instruments, Vernon Hills,
IL, USA). The system was controlled with the software
packages MicrOTOF Control v.2.2 and HyStar v.3.2
(Bruker Daltonics). Data were processed with Data Analysis v.3.4 software (Bruker Daltonics). Quantification was
carried out by external calibration with standards of
sucrose, raffinose and galactinol (Sigma).
