Abstract
Background: Approximately half of the mitochondrial genome inherent within 546 individual Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar) derived from across the species’ North Atlantic range, was selectively amplified with a novel
combination of standard PCR and pyro-sequencing in a single run using 454 Titanium FLX technology (Roche, 454
Life Sciences). A unique combination of barcoded primers and a partitioned sequencing plate was employed to
designate each sequence read to its original sample. The sequence reads were aligned according to the S. salar
mitochondrial reference sequence (NC_001960.1), with the objective of identifying single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). They were validated if they met with the following three stringent criteria: (i) sequence
reads were produced from both DNA strands; (ii) SNPs were confirmed in a minimum of 90% of replicate
sequence reads; and (iii) SNPs occurred in more than one individual.
Results: Pyrosequencing generated a total of 179,826,884 bp of data, and 10,765 of the total 10,920 S. salar
sequences (98.6%) were assigned back to their original samples. The approach taken resulted in a total of 216 SNPs
and 2 indels, which were validated and mapped onto the S. salar mitochondrial genome, including 107 SNPs and
one indel not previously reported. An average of 27.3 sequence reads with a standard deviation of 11.7 supported
each SNP per individual.
Conclusion: The study generated a mitochondrial SNP panel from a large sample group across a broad
geographical area, reducing the potential for ascertainment bias, which has hampered previous studies. The SNPs
identified here validate those identified in previous studies, and also contribute additional potentially informative
loci for the future study of phylogeography and evolution in the Atlantic salmon. The overall success experienced
with this novel application of HT sequencing of targeted regions suggests that the same approach could be
successfully applied for SNP mining in other species.

Background
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), representing
single base differences between individuals, are a common form of genome variation [1]. Once identified,
SNPs have the potential to be used as genotyping markers for population assignment or in phylogeographic
analysis, and are rapidly becoming the marker of choice
within this field of study [2]. The emergence of high* Correspondence: olafur@matis.is

throughput (HT) sequencing technologies provides an
unparalleled opportunity for the cost-effective sequencing of targeted genomic regions for SNP identification.
HT sequencing has been applied for SNP discovery in
humans [3,4], animals [5], plants [6,7] and bacteria [8] in species where reference genomes exist. In organisms
lacking a sequenced reference genome, SNPs have also
been mined from the random sequencing of either
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [9,10] or reduced representation libraries [11-13]. However, with an available
reference sequence, specific genetic regions of interest
can be amplified using PCR prior to HT sequencing.

The sequence reads of about 400 bp obtained using the
Titanium GS FLX chemistry (Roche, 454 Life Sciences)
make the 454 sequencing platform particularly suitable
for sequencing PCR generated amplicons. This approach
involves the emulsion based amplification of individual
PCR products and simultaneous, parallel pyrosequencing
of DNA strands [14].
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been widely used in
studies of phylogenetics, molecular ecology and phylogeography in a range of organisms, including the Atlantic salmon based on RFLP or sequences from using
Sanger technology [15-17]. As SNPs represent the main
form of polymorphism observed in the mtDNA, recent
research has been focused upon the identification of a
geographically informative mitochondrial SNP panel suitable for high-throughput genotyping (e.g. mtSNP minisequencing) [18].
Traditional Sanger-based sequencing methods are
relatively expensive and time-consuming, restricting the
number of individuals and gene regions that can be
sequenced, given the funding available for most studies.
Consequently, often a relatively few individuals from
restricted geographical areas have been sequenced in
order to obtain SNP panels. The SNPs have been subsequently used to screen larger samples from a broader
geographical range [1], which has led to low power in
resolving lineages and their relationships. It has also
raised potentially serious concerns associated with ascertainment bias, such as the situation whereby inferences
are significantly conditioned by the gene region screened
or the populations used to identify the polymorphisms.
The latter could potentially lead to a biased interpretation of the extent to which individuals and populations
are related.
HT sequencing technologies offer the potential to
overcome these limitations by allowing the rapid and
economic sequencing of large genome regions. However,
most applications of HT technology to-date have been
designed to sequence a large number of fragments from
relatively few individuals. In this study, a novel approach
was developed by combining the traditional PCR amplification of known gene regions with 454 Titanium FLX
(Roche, 454 Life Sciences) sequencing. This approach
allowed the sequencing of extensive regions of the
mtDNA genome within a broad sample group both
quickly and in accordance with a limited budget. The
method was tested on the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) a fish extensively surveyed using both nuclear [19] and
mitochondrial DNA markers, including a mtDNA SNP
variation [19-22], and for which 152 nuclear SNPs and
125 mtDNA SNPs [20,22,23] have already been reported.
Here, 546 samples from 48 locations throughout the species’ geographical range were screened for 7215 bp,
encompassing approximately 43% of the mtDNA genome

in order to minimize the degree of ascertainment bias relative to previous comparable studies.

Results
PCR Amplification

546 S. salar samples derived from across the species’
North Atlantic range were included in this study
(Figure 1). In addition, 12 brown trout and 18 Arctic
charr samples were included in the sequencing setup as
a part of another study. The samples were divided into
16 groups, each composed of 36 samples (see Additional
file 1, Table S1). Ten regions of the S. salar mitochondrial genome covering the D-loop region and nine coding genes (ND1, ND2, COXI, COXII, ATP6, ND3, ND4,
ND5, CYTB) were selected for the SNP detection
(Table 1), taking into account those regions previously
shown to have high levels of polymorphism by studies of
EST libraries and genome sequencing [19,20,22]. Some of
the target regions were divided into 2-3 amplicons of
about 400 bp, which is the average sequence length
obtained with the FLX Titanium chemistry (Table 1).
Thus, each sample was subjected to a total of 20 PCR
reactions. For each of the 16 sample groups, 720 PCR
reactions were carried out separately (Figure 2). Single
PCR products of the expected sizes were obtained
from the majority of the 11,520 reactions performed.
Only 127 PCR reactions (1.1%) with S. salar DNA
yielded low quantities of amplified products, despite
optimization. Geographic bias was not pronounced;
although the amplification of approximately half of
the samples from two rivers produced low yields. This
could be attributed to limited or low quality DNA
isolated from the corresponding samples (data not
shown).
Pyrosequencing and Amplicon Analysis

The PCR products for each group were pooled for
sequencing in near equimolar concentrations and the
sequencing was carried out as described in Materials
and Methods. The pyrosequencing yielded a total of
179,826,884 filter passed base pairs. An average of
11,546,081 bp (±1,612,536 SD) was obtained from each
of the 16 regions on the picotiter plate, excluding one
that yielded 6,635,668 bp. The majority of sequence
reads were between 400-420 bp, corresponding to the
size of the amplicons (see Additional file 2, Figure S1
and Table S2, on the distribution of read length). Each
PCR product contained multiplex identifying sequences
[MIDs], designed by Roche (454 Life Sciences), at both
ends, which enabled the identification of the corresponding sample within a group (Figure 2). Hence, to
correctly assign a PCR product to a sample, its entire
sequence was required, including both MIDs. The GS
Amplicon Variant Analyzer software from Roche, 454

The amplicon sequences without primers within each region do not overlap (see Table in Additional material 4). Accordingly, the total number of bp analyzed
from the mitochondrion DNA was 7215.

Figure 2 The experimental setup. In order to sequence 20 mitochondrial amplicons from 576 samples of Atlantic salmon, brown trout and
Arctic charr, in a single run, the isolated DNA was divided into 16 groups, each containing 36 samples. The mitochondrial fragments were
amplified from each group in a matrix of PCR reactions, using barcoded primers (MIDs) (A). 20 matrices of PCR reactions, one for each
mitochondrion fragment, were carried out (B). Up to 720 amplicons from each group were pooled together in near equimolar concentrations.
The 16 pools created were used to generate single stranded fragment DNA templates for the FLX sequencing. 16 amplified sst libraries,
consisting of DNA fragments on beads, were loaded onto a PicoTiterPlate equipped with a sixteen-lane gasket where each library was assigned
one lane (C). Based on the combination of MIDs on both sites of the amplicons within each group (library), individual sequencing reads were
assigned to the corresponding samples.

Life Sciences was used to align and assign the sequence
reads. The sequences obtained were assigned to 10,765
of the 10,920 S. salar products targeted by PCR (98.6%).
The number of sequence reads (sequence coverage)
supporting a SNP per individual was on average 27.3
with a standard deviation of 11.74. The yield of
sequenced S. salar amplicons was generally high, with
less than 1.5% of samples missing on average. The
exception to this observation was amplicon 18 (Table 1),
where no sequences were obtained for 62 of 546 S. salar
samples (12%).
SNP Analysis

The GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer software identified a
total of 1714 variants following alignment of the raw
sequence data. Applying the first stringency filter,
requiring sequence reads from both DNA strands,
reduced this number to 904. After rejecting variants
resulting from potential sequencing errors, including
under-reads of homopolymer regions, and single base
insertions, the variants were confined to those confirmed in at least 90% of replicate sequence reads. Subsequently, 242 variants remained. Thereof, 24 variants
were rejected since they occurred in only one individual.
Consequently, the alignment analysis and filtering
yielded a total of 218 variants, consisting of 216 SNPs
and 2 indels. Maps of the S. salar mitochondrial genome, indicating the regions selected for the SNP analysis
and the accepted SNPs for each region are shown in
Figure 3 and 4, respectively. (See also Table 1, and
Additional file 3, Table S3, for further details on 454

read statistics). The greatest number of SNPs was
observed in the ND4 gene region (38), whilst the lowest
number (10) was observed in the ND3 gene. When
considered as a proportion of the length of each region,
the D-loop had the highest density of SNPs (0.55 SNPs
bp -1 ) whilst the COX2 region gene yielded the least
(0.021 SNPs bp -1 ). Of the variants observed, 196 are
transitions while 20 are transversions, and nearly half of
the latter is located in the D-Loop region (Table 1). In
three cases (D-Loop: bp973; ND1: bp3989 and CYT-B:
bp16421) both a transition and transversion were
observed at the same locus in different samples. Indels
were only observed within the D-Loop region, with a
two bp insertion (CT) at bp 963 and a two bp deletion
at bp 967. When compared to previous studies of smaller [20] and more geographically constrained discovery
panels [15,19,22-24], 109 of the SNPs and one of the
indels had been reported, while 107 new SNPs and one
indel were identified in this study (Figure 4). When this
data is considered according to populations, 0.5% of
SNPs were found in all geographic locations, whilst
13.1% existed in only one. Additionally, a further 56.3%
were found in less than 10 populations, whilst 13.1%
were found in more than 50% of populations.

Discussion
Next generation sequencing technology, such as 454
sequencing, is rapidly expanding the possibility for SNP
mining by genome sequencing within a reasonable budget. However, the technology to-date has generally been
restricted to the sequencing of large regions of the

genome using relatively few samples [12,13]. In this
work, a large SNP ascertainment panel was obtained at
a relatively low cost by amplifying multiple regions of a
mitochondrial genome in numerous samples and their
subsequent sequencing using the 454 technology. The
resultant SNP panel provides the least likelihood of
ascertainment bias [25], with a discovery panel of 546
samples from 48 locations across the North Atlantic
range of S. salar, making this the most informative and
geographically comprehensive SNP panel for the species
to-date (Figure 1).
The cost of sequencing using the 454 platform was
minimized by carefully designing the experiment to
require only a single pyrosequencing run, whilst obtaining sufficient sequence reads in both directions to yield
a robust result, essentially minimizing false positives and
avoid missing true polymorphisms from each ~400 bp
read. The most challenging aspect faced was the need to
ensure that each individual amplicon of a given type
could be traced to the original sample. This was
achieved using a sequencing plate with a 16-region gasket, and a set of 5’ MID primer sequences. To decrease

the primer cost (and ultimately the overall cost), the
necessary adaptor sequences for the 454 sequencing
were ligated to the PCR products instead of including
them in the primer sequences; this may have also
reduced complications in the PCR reactions due to the
shorter 5’ non-complementary primer sequences. Thus,
sequencing libraries were prepared for the 16 PCR pools
using the GS FLX Titanium General Library Preparation
protocol for shotgun sequencing, instead of using amplicon sequencing (Roche, 454 Life Sciences). Furthermore,
a Taq-comparable polymerase was used for generating
the PCR pools of 11,520 reactions, instead of using an
expensive high fidelity polymerase. The lack of proofreading activity during the PCR might have increased
the error rate in the sequence data, although the numerous specimens used here as well as the sequence coverage obtained should adequately compensate for this.
Furthermore, variations observed in a single individual
were not accepted as SNPs in accordance with the set
criteria. Even if legitimate SNPs were necessarily discarded in this manner, their low frequency suggests that
any information that was lost was probably minimal.

Given that there is no geographical or population association, it can be assumed that this would not compromise the informative essence of the overall SNP suite, at
least from the perspective of the studies of biodiversity
and phylogeography. Considering the high coverage
obtained in this experiment, the application of a high
fidelity polymerase could enable the reliable SNP detection for simultaneous processing of even greater sample
numbers than in the current study. Thus, if the budget
is not restricting, the processing capacity of the method
can be further increased by applying a high fidelity polymerase to generate the amplicons, at the cost of
sequence coverage.
The sequence yield in this experiment was approximately 179 million bp, which is within the range of 160320 million bp expected for Titanium 454 sequencing,
using a 16-region gasket (Roche, 454 Life Sciences).
However, for an undetermined reason, the sequence
yield ranged from 6,635,668 to 13,135,520 filter-passed
base pairs between different regions of the sequencing
plate. Also, the sequence yield for amplicon 18 was relatively low in comparison to that of the other amplicons.
This could be due to a bias in the sample pooling.
Nevertheless, the distribution of sequences was relatively

similar over the sample range, resulting in an average
coverage of 27.3 (±11.7) sequence reads per SNP per
individual. The sequencing setup described here also
included 30 brown trout and Arctic charr samples. The
data sets obtained for these samples were not included
in this analysis, and they will be the subject of future
studies. Nevertheless, they are mentioned here since
they were a part of the original experimental setup of
576 individuals divided into 16 groups, each with 36
individuals. The total number of base pairs that were to
be sequenced in this study (including the brown trout
and Arctic charr samples) was 4,115,840 bp (number of
sequenced bases for 576 individuals). The total sequence
data obtained consisted of 179.826.884 bp, so 39-fold
coverage would therefore be expected. However, a substantial part of the sequence reads were not assigned to
any sample and were consequently excluded from the
analysis. The anticipated reason behind this is accounted
to short sequence reads missing a MID from either end.
Fusing MID sequences to only one end of an amplicon
should reduce this problem and increase the number of
analysed sequence reads. This practice, however, reduces
the number of samples, which can be analysed simultaneously, although with the emergence of new MID

Fridjonsson et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:179
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/179

sequences validated for 454 sequencing, more samples
with only one MID could be assigned.
Although the existence of MIDs on both ends of a
sequence read was requisite in order to assign it to the
corresponding individual, some global and consensi
alignments (made with the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer) included partial sequences. This was the result of
default stringency levels causing parts of some
sequences with low quality bases to be discarded. The
trimming was however performed following the alignment of the sequence reads. Hence, as the design of the
MIDs allows for (corrects) two sequencing errors, these
partial sequences could still be assigned to the corresponding individual prior to the trimming.
As expected for high-throughput sequencing methods,
which produce high amounts of reads, numerous deviations from the reference sequence were observed in the
raw data. The stringent criteria applied here for the SNP
validation rejected the great majority of these variants.
However, the filtering may also have eliminated legitimate SNPs. Such variants could be identified by a modest
reduction in the stringency levels and verified by Sanger
sequencing. Following the validation, about 3.0% of the
bases screened exhibited sequence variance and the final
number of variants, 218 (including two indels), is nearly
double the number of mtDNA SNPs previously reported.
The new SNPs are predominantly transitions although
the number of transversions is relatively high in the noncoding D-loop region (Table 1). Similar transition/transversion ratios were observed in other studies on the
genetic variability of the S. salar mitochondrion
[19,20,22]. The 107 new SNPs and a new indel identified
in this study are indicated in Figure 4 in red letters.
Although the average number of sequence reads supporting the new SNPs per individual is similar to that of those
reported, the number of individuals harbouring the new
SNPs is generally lower (see Additional file 3, Table S3).
This is due to the numerous samples and the great geographical range analyzed here, which consequently
allowed the detection of new rare variants. The greater
the number of amplicons and individuals screened, the
more likely it is that an accurate picture of the extent and
nature of SNP variation will be revealed, and that a suite
of SNP markers for population genetic studies can be
compiled. The challenge remains to determine the optimal balance between the number of amplicons (i.e. proportion of mtDNA genome screened), the number of
populations (i.e. representativeness of species as a whole)
and the number of individuals per population for studies
of matrilineal variation in the target species, Atlantic salmon. This will only be achieved by a detailed analysis of
the within and among population variation and a consideration of the robustness of its evolutionary and phylogeographic implications. It should, however, provide a

Page 7 of 10

basis for robust inferences concerning the general levels
of genetic diversity in the species and broad scale, deep
phylogenetic structuring. Given, though, that the geographical sampling is extensive rather than intensive, and
that sample sizes per population are limited, the ability to
resolve any finer scale, shallower evolutionary structuring
on the regional level will be diminished. To achieve the
latter, a more focused and intensive search, based on
sequencing of the entire mtDNA genome from more
individuals would be of greater use since a higher proportion of regionally or population restricted or low frequency polymorphisms could be detected.
The analysis of within and among population distribution of variation is currently underway and can be
expected to yield considerable insights into the phylogeography and matrilineal evolution of the Atlantic salmon. Analysis of the linkage of variation and its spatial
distribution should also assist in the identification of a
subset of the overall SNP suite that can be genetically
typed more cost-effectively using PCR-based SNP assays.
The SNP subset could then be investigated within samples from a wider geographical range and in archival
material, in order to establish a more accurate assessment of the mixed stock assignment and population
evolutionary hypotheses extracted from the current data
set. Additionally, the markers that were identified in the
study will likely prove highly useful as genetic tags for
use in the assessment of the extent of population processes such as female mediated gene flow, as well as for
tracking individual family groups in experimental
studies.

Conclusion
A novel approach that combines targeted PCR amplification and a single HT sequencing run proved successful in
screening numerous targeted genomic regions in a large
number of individuals. This technique presents a valuable
tool for the identification of SNPs for population studies
in other species, and also minimizes the risks of ascertainment bias associated with previous approaches that
screened either confined regions of the genome or only
several individuals from few populations.
Methods
Samples and DNA Extraction

Atlantic salmon samples (N = 546) were collected from
48 locations throughout the North Atlantic range of the
species using electro-fishing. Additionally, 12 brown
trout (Salmo trutta) and 18 Arctic charr (Salvelinus
alpinus) samples were included in the sequencing run as
a part of the experimental setup shown in Figure 2.
Table S1 submitted as Additional file 1 lists the sampling
sites, the number of samples, and their subdivision into
16 groups. DNA was isolated from fin-clip tissue samples

using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and standard protocols, and DNA concentrations were measured
with a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer. The concentrations of stock DNA eluted were 9-484 ng/μl and
diluted to 2-10 ng/μl for subsequent PCR reactions.
Primer Design

Ten regions of the S. salar mitochondrial genome
(DLOOPB, ND1, ND2, COXI, COXII, ATP6, ND3,
ND4, ND5, CYTB) were selected for SNP detection
(Table 1). Seven of the ten selected gene regions were
amplified in two or three fragments of approximately
400 bps, resulting in a total of 20 amplicons covering
7,215 bps excluding the primer binding sites (Table 1).
Primers were designed according to the reference
sequence (16.7 kb) of the S. salar mitochondrion
(NC_001960.1) (see Additional File 4, Table S4). Barcodes or multiplex identifying sequences (MIDs) of 10
bp were added to the 5’ end of each primer, providing a
unique means of identification for every sample in a single sequence group. The MIDs used (Figure 2), were
those designed by Roche, 454 Life Sciences for automated software identification of samples following
sequencing and allow up to 2 sequencing errors in the
MID region before a read is misidentified. To minimize
the number of MID tagged primers required, samples
were divided into 16 groups, each composed of 36 individuals (see Additional File 1, Table S1, for subdivision
of samples). Six forward MID-primers (numbered 1-6)
and six reverse MID-primers (numbered 7-12) were
synthesized (Sigma Aldrich) for each of the 20 amplicons. As a consequence of using a combination of 6 forward and 6 reverse MID tagged primers, the same MIDs
could be re-used by conducting the PCR and sequencing
of each of the 16 groups separately (See primer matrix,
Figure 2). Critically, this minimized the cost associated
with the use of multiple MID tagged primers.
PCR Setup

In order to simultaneously amplify 20 traceable mitochondrial fragments from 576 samples in a single run,
PCR reactions for each group of 36 samples were conducted separately, resulting in a total of 11,520 PCR
reactions across all 16 groups. PCR was performed in 20
μl reactions containing 0.5 mM betaine (Sigma Aldrich),
50 μM dNTP mix, 1 × reaction buffer and 1 U Teg
polymerase (Matís production, Taq comparable polymerase), 0.5 μM each primer (synthesized by Sigma
Aldrich) and 2-3 μl DNA (2-10 ng/μl). Initial denaturation was at 94°C for 2 minutes followed by 31-33 cycles
of 94°C for 60 seconds, 53°C for 45 seconds and 72°C
for 90 seconds, and then a final extension of 5 minutes
at 72°C. The relative amount of PCR products was estimated using gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide

staining. Subsequently, products from each group were
pooled in near equimolar concentrations resulting in 16
pools of up to 720 amplicons.
Construction of single stranded DNA libraries

The DNA pools (3 μg) were electrophoresed on 1%
agarose gels and a band of approximately 400 bp was
purified from each pool using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). These were subsequently examined
using Bioanalyzer 2100 and a DNA 7500 LabChip (Agilent Technologies). Observed traces were correlative for
all 16 sample groups, with an average fragment length
of 425 bp. Both ends of the DNA fragments were
repaired, phosphorylated and ligated to adaptor oligonucleotides A and B. The DNA fragments carrying the
5’-biotin of adaptor B were immobilized onto magnetic
streptavidin coated beads. Single stranded template
DNAs carrying adaptor A at the 5’-end and adaptor B at
the 3’-end were then purified by alkaline denaturation.
Reagents, enzymes and oligonucleotides for the singlestranded DNA (sst DNA) library construction were
supplied with the GS FLX Titanium General Library
Preparation Kit (Roche, 454 Life Sciences). The integrity
and concentrations of the sst libraries were estimated
using the Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 LabChip and
Quant-iT Ribogreen DNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen),
respectively.
454 pyrosequencing and assembly

Shotgun sequencing of the 16 sst DNA libraries was carried out using the GS FLX Titanium reagents as
described by the manufacturer (Roche, 454 Life
Sciences). Purified DNA fragments were hybridised onto
DNA capture beads and the 16 sst DNA libraries were
separately amplified by emulsion PCR. Beads containing
amplified DNA were deposited onto a 75 × 75 mm Titanium PicoTiterPlate equipped with a sixteen-region gasket. Those corresponding to each of the 16 original
DNA pools (20 amplicons from 36 individuals) were
assigned one region and then the pyrosequencing was
performed in a single run. The sequence data generated
from each region, corresponding to each of the 16
groups, was assembled separately using the GS Amplicon
Variant Analyzer software (Roche, 454 Life Sciences)
with default stringency settings. Sequence reads were
sorted according to the sequence and the combination of
the MIDs, and the sequence reads from an individual for
each amplicon were aligned with the S. salar reference
sequence (NC_001960.1).
SNP analysis and mapping

Candidate SNPs were identified and checked against the
global and consensus alignments of the corresponding
sequence using the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer

Fridjonsson et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:179

software (Roche, 454 Life Sciences). Variants resulting
from potential sequencing errors, including under-reads of
homopolymer regions, and single base insertions (carryforward events) were rejected [26]. Homopolymer
under-reads and carry-forward events were observed in
the misalignment of underlying consensi, by confirming
support in both forward and reverse reads and, where
necessary, the observation of underlying flowgrams. SNPs
were accepted as valid only if they met the following criteria: (i) Sequence reads with variants were produced from
both DNA strands. (ii) Those with >90% support from
sequencing reads should have a total of more than 10 supporting reads in both read directions, or in cases of less
than 10 supporting reads that the SNP in question should
also be present in other samples with higher support.
(iii) The final list of SNPs rejected those only found in one
sample as these readings could be considered uninformative and possibly arose as a result of a PCR or sequencing
error. To determine the sequence coverage for each SNP
per individual, only sequence reads comprising the consensus sequence, truly supporting the SNP were taken
into account, excluding those reads that did not show the
variance (e.g. due to a sequencing error or truncation).
