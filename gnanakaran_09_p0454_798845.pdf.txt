Background
Structure-assisted immunogen design plays a central role
in current efforts to create an effective HIV-1 vaccine.
Much of this effort utilizes available structural information on Env as an antigen. Considerably less is known
about the molecular determinants of Env immunogenicity. We sought to close this gap by identifying amino acid
signatures in serum-derived gp160 genes that associate
with broadly neutralizing antibody responses.

Methods
Computational tools for robust clustering of like-patterns
of neutralization potency were designed based on Kmeans clustering, factoring in the uncertainty that results
from limited sampling (bootstrap) and assay variability
(noise). Phylogenetically corrected methods were used to
identify associations between genetic mutations and distinct neutralization clusters.

Results

we analyzed a checkerboard-style neutralization dataset
comprising a multi-subtype panel of clonal Env-pseudotyped viruses (n = 25) and sera from 68 infected individuals from whom a serum gp160 sequence was derived by
single genome amplification (SGA). Three distinct clusters
of sera with high, medium and low neutralization potencies were identified. By analysis of the SGA-derived Env
sequences from these individuals, three amino acid positions were identified in the CD4-inducible (CD4i) region
of gp120 that strongly associated with neutralization
potency.

Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the CD4i region of gp120 is a
key determinant (although not necessarily a target) of
broadly NAb responses in HIV-1-infected individuals. In
addition to providing new insights for immunogen
design, these computational tools may be useful in delineating the neutralization epitopes of novel monoclonal
antibodies.

For validation, we first analyzed Env sequences from 251
clonal viruses that were differentially sensitive to MAb
b12. Three amino acid positions that are known to occur
in the b12 binding surface of gp120 strongly associated
with b12 potency. An additional three positions in gp120
and one in the C-heptad repeat of gp41 were identified
that could be distal sites that impact b12 potency. Next,
