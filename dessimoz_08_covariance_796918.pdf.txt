Abstract
Background: The estimation of a distance between two biological sequences is a fundamental
process in molecular evolution. It is usually performed by maximum likelihood (ML) on characters
aligned either pairwise or jointly in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Estimators for the
covariance of pairs from an MSA are known, but we are not aware of any solution for cases of pairs
aligned independently. In large-scale analyses, it may be too costly to compute MSAs every time
distances must be compared, and therefore a covariance estimator for distances estimated from
pairs aligned independently is desirable. Knowledge of covariances improves any process that
compares or combines distances, such as in generalized least-squares phylogenetic tree building,
orthology inference, or lateral gene transfer detection.
Results: In this paper, we introduce an estimator for the covariance of distances from sequences
aligned pairwise. Its performance is analyzed through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and
compared to the well-known variance estimator of ML distances. Our covariance estimator can be
used together with the ML variance estimator to form covariance matrices.
Conclusion: The estimator performs similarly to the ML variance estimator. In particular, it shows
no sign of bias when sequence divergence is below 150 PAM units (i.e. above ~29% expected
sequence identity). Above that distance, the covariances tend to be underestimated, but then ML
variances are also underestimated.

Background
The estimation of evolutionary distances between gene/
protein sequences is one of the most important problems
in molecular evolution. In particular, it lies at the heart of
most phylogenetic tree construction methods. The estimation of such distances is a two step process: first, homologous characters are identified, then the distances are
estimated from the character substitution patterns. The
most accurate matching of homologous characters is
obtained by multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
Indeed, by considering all sequences simultaneously,

MSAs yield a consistent and in principle optimal grouping
of the homologous characters. Unfortunately, MSAs are
hard to compute optimally (time complexity exponential
in the number of sequences), and thus are in practice
computed using heuristics. Alternatively, the sequences
can be analyzed exclusively on the basis of pairs of
sequences, using an algorithm such as Smith-Waterman
[1] that yields optimal pairwise alignments (OPAs). This
approach is often taken by large-scale comparative
genomics analysis such as MIPS, OMA or RoundUp [2-4],

which analyze the sequences pairwise due to computational constraints.
Once the homologous characters are identified, the second step of distance estimation can proceed. The method
of choice is a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation based
on some model of evolution. There too, the distances can
either be estimated simultaneously from all sequences
using a combination of tree topology inference and joint
optimization of all branches, or pairwise, by estimating
the distances between every pair of sequences. Joint estimation requires MSAs, while pairwise distance estimation
can be done from either OPAs or from the pairwise alignments induced by an MSA (IPAs). Fig. 1 provides an overview of the different approaches.
In all cases, the estimation of evolutionary distances is
subject to inference uncertainty, which is commonly
quantified by their variances and covariances. Indeed, the
distance variance information can be used to build confidence intervals around the estimate; covariances of pairs

of distances can be used to build the confidence intervals
of combinations of distances. Examples of applications
include generalized least squares (GLS) phylogenetic tree
building [5] construction of confidence sets of trees [6],
test for monophyly using likelihood ratios [7], comparison of evolutionary distances for orthology inference [3],
or distance-based lateral gene transfer detection [8]
Variance estimates are provided by ML theory in both
joint and pairwise distances estimation. However, ML theory only provides covariance estimates if all distances are
estimated jointly. Covariance estimates for distances computed from IPAs in the context of specific parametric substitution models have been reported by Hasegawa et al.
[9] and Bulmer [6], and were generalized by Susko [10] to
all Markovian models of evolution. Furthermore, the covariance of distances from IPAs can also be estimated
(though much more slowly) through bootstrapping [11].
As for the covariance of distances obtained from OPAs,
the main difficulty in computing them is that, since
sequence pairs are aligned individually, they usually have

Overview of approaches to estimate evolutionary distances and their covariances
Figure 1
Overview of approaches to estimate evolutionary distances and their covariances. A set of n sequences can be

aligned jointly to obtain an MSA or in a pairwise optimal manner resulting in ⎜ ⎟ optimal pairwise alignments (OPAs). Given
⎝2⎠
a hypothesis of character homology, distance estimation per ML can essentially be done in two ways: jointly on a tree or pairwise. In the first case a tree's branch-lengths are estimated simultaneously. This requires an MSA. In the second case pairwise
distances are estimated either from MSA induced pairwise alignments (IPAs) or from the OPAs. The distance estimators are
afflicted with an error expressed by their variances and covariances. In all cases, the covariances can be modeled as a function
of shared branch lengths, but this requires a phylogenetic tree. When distances are estimated based on an MSA, the variances
and covariances can be obtained from ML theory or by bootstrapping over the MSA's columns. In the case of OPAs, these
techniques cannot be directly applied (see Methods). We have previously presented a covariance estimator for the case where
the two OPAs in question share a sequence (i.e. for triplets). In this paper, we introduce an estimator for the general case.

inconsistencies in their inference of the homologous characters (or else, computing an MSA from pairwise alignments would be trivial). Thus, the alignments cannot be
partitioned in consistent "columns" of characters, and
neither Susko's method nor resampling approaches such
as bootstrapping can be applied. Indeed, in the case of
analyses relying exclusively on pairwise comparison and
distance estimation, i.e. where no MSA computation can
be afforded, we are not aware of any previously published
estimator for the covariance of distances estimates from
pairwise alignments.
We have shown in a previous article [12] a numerical
approximation for the constrained case of the covariance
of two OPA distances involving a common sequence (i.e.
on a triplet of sequences), for empirical substitution models such as PAM or JTT. In this article, we present an estimator for the covariance of ML distances estimated from
OPAs that works on triplets and quartets of sequences.
This solves the problem of sets of sequences of arbitrary
size, because each covariance involves at most four
sequences at a time. Thus, the full covariance matrix is naturally obtained through quartet analysis. We analyze the
performances of the estimator in terms of bias and variance. Finally, we compare the results obtained on triplets
of sequences to our previous work.

Results and Discussion
In the following, we present and analyze the performances of the estimator for the covariance of two distances.
For this purpose, it is informative to analyze the results
separately for the following three different underlying
topological relations, illustrated in Fig. 2:
Case of dependence
The two distances are estimated between four distinct
sequences, and they have some evolution in common (i.e.
the two distance involve a common branch on the tree).

Possible2
Possible topological relations of sequences. For two
pairwise distances, one can distinguish three possible underlying topological configurations relating them. If they are estimated between four sequences, there are two possible
configurations. Either they share some common evolution (a)
or they are independent (b). In the third configuration, the
two distances are estimated from two OPAs that share a
sequence (c).

With such an evolutionary history, the two distances estimates covary positively.
Case of independence
The two distances are estimated between four distinct
sequences, but they have no evolution in common (i.e.
the two distance involve distinct branches on the tree).
This case is informative, because a central assumption in
most evolutionary models is that evolution on different
branches is independent [13]. With no branch in common, the distances should not covary [6]. Thus, such a
topology can be used to test the estimators as negative
control.
Case of triplet
The two distances involve a common sequence, and have
some evolution in common. This case is of special interest, because we have previously presented an alternate
estimator for this particular case using a different
approach [12]. Thus, we can compare our results to this
approach, hereafter called "the numerical approximation".

Note that the covariances are estimated using the same
algorithm in all three cases: we only distinguish them
from each another for the purpose of this analysis.
To assess the performance of the covariance estimator, it
was compared against the Monte Carlo covariance estimator. In short, each point shown in the figures was obtained
from 40,000 sets of sequences mutated along a random
quartet subtree of the tree of life (see Methods below). That
way, the evaluation is based on tree samples that are distributed as closely as possible to real biological data. To
account for gene families with varying rates, each quartet
was scaled with a random factor uniformly distributed
between 0.5 and 2. Note that results corresponding to very
large distance constitute extreme cases; for instance, when
sequences are 150 PAM units apart, each position has, on
average, mutated 1.5 times.
Fig. 3a shows the mean of our estimator versus the Monte
Carlo estimator in nine scatterplots arising from combining the topologies mentioned above (rows) with three different sequence lengths (columns). In the case of
dependence, the first row, we see that our estimator lies in
about 80% of the cases within the 95% confidence interval of the Monte Carlo estimator. In the case of independence, both estimators are close to zero, though our
estimator shows a minor upward bias in some cases. The
third row gives the result of both the covariance estimator
introduced here, as well as the numerical approximation
from our previous study [12]. Here, we see that though the
former performs well in cases of lower covariance values,
it shows a clear downward bias in cases of larger covari-

ances. The numerical approximation does not present any
apparent sign of bias, which is hardly surprising, given
that it was obtained through regression. What is however
surprising, is that, given its simple structure, it performs
better than the covariance estimator, which takes into

(see e.g. [14]). As can be seen in Fig. 3b, the ML variance
is also biased for high variance values. We conjecture that
this is mainly due to mis-aligned positions, which cause
model violations in the parameter estimation. This problem is also likely to affect the covariance estimator. Even
more directly, the ML variance estimator is a factor in the
expression of the covariance estimator (see Methods), so
any error in the ML variance is propagated to the covariance estimator. At this point, improving the ML estimator
for cases of high divergence is likely to require better alignments, or an explicit modeling of the mis-aligned positions, which is beyond the scope of the present work.
Further, to put the bias of the covariance estimator into
perspective, we compared it to the standard deviation of
the estimator. Fig. 4 presents the bias and standard deviation as function of the average number of anchors for
sequence length of 500. The anchors are the positions that
are consistently aligned in the OPAs involved (see methods for the precise definition). Both bias and standard
deviation strongly depend on the fraction of anchors,
which can be thought of as a measure of alignment quality. Fig. 5 depicts the dependency between percentage of
anchors and average distance. As one would expect, the
fraction of anchors decreases as divergence increases. For
a fraction of anchor positions below 60%, the average of
the two distances involved in the covariance computation
is always greater than 150 PAM. In Fig. 4, we first consider
the bias and standard deviation for the case of dependence. When the fraction of anchor positions is above 60%
(this is the case for approximately 85% of the quartets of
sequences in families of orthologs in OMA [3], data not
shown), the bias is far smaller than the standard deviation, and is therefore likely to have little negative impact
in practice.
In the case of triplets, the bias exceeds the standard deviation already when the fraction of anchors is about 80%.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/179

The ML variance estimator has this transition around 75%
of anchors. In the case of independence, where we expect
our covariance estimator to be zero, its bias is always
much smaller than its standard deviation (data not
shown).
Most applications of the covariance estimator involve the
ˆ
covariance matrix. Let A be an approximation to the
matrix A. We refer to

||A − A||2
||A||2

ˆ
as the relative error in A ,

where ||·||2 denotes the two-norm. Fig. 6 shows the relative error of the 2 × 2 variance-covariance matrices computed with the ML variance estimator in the diagonal
entries and our covariance estimator in the off-diagonal
entries, and the same 2 × 2 matrices with only diagonal
entries. The plots show that for the dependence case the
the matrices with both covariance and ML variance estimators have a equal or lower relative error than the matrices with the ML variance only, except for a few cases in the
region with a high fraction of anchors. In the triplet case,
the variance-covariance matrices have always lower error
then variance matrices. Finally, in the case of independence, the matrices with covariance do not always have
lower relative error, but this is expected, because the true
covariance is null in this special case.

Conclusion
We have presented a method to estimate the covariances
of distances estimated from pairwise alignments. It does
not require the construction of MSAs, which are hard to
compute and therefore are only approximated in practice.
Furthermore, it does not rely on phylogenetic trees as it is
the case with covariance estimation from joint ML, or in
covariance estimation methods that model the covariances as a function of shared branch lengths [15,16]. Tree

meanwhile, it is probably best to issue a warning if the
percentage of anchors falls below some threshold.

The estimation of evolutionary distances is a very important process in molecular evolution, and therefore the
covariance estimator presented here will be of use for various applications, such as the construction of GLS trees on
OPA distances, the construction of confidence sets of trees
based on the GLS test statistic, relative-rate tests, distancebased lateral gene transfer detection, and in general in any
process that needs to estimate confidence of distance
combinations.

building is not only a costly process, but is also subject to
inference errors.
The accuracy of our estimator is comparable to the ML variance estimator. Both estimators are biased but in both
cases the bias is, for distances below 150 PAM, far smaller
than their standard deviation. The bias of the covariance
estimator (as well as the ML variance, and to some extent
the distance estimators) becomes worse with declining
percentage of anchors. These biases arise because the
alignment positions under scrutiny do not constitute an
unbiased subsample of the true homologous positions.
Note that misaligned positions are likely to affect distances from MSAs too. A solution to this problem would
lead to better distance estimates in the first place. In the

Covariance of distances from OPAs
In this section we derive a covariance estimator for ML distances from OPAs.
Preliminaries
The columns of an MSA are a consistent hypothesis of
character homology for a set of sequences. With OPAs on
the other hand, we have the problem that for a set
sequences, the resulting pairwise alignments are not
always consistent in their inference of the homologous
characters. Fig. 7 depicts an example. Let si,j be the character at position j in a sequence si. Only characters in bold,
for example {s1,1, s2,1, s3,1, s4,1}, are consistently aligned in
the OPAs. We call such a consistent set of characters an
anchor. On the other hand, s1,2 is aligned to s2,2 and to s3,2,
so in a consistent situation it would follow that s2,2 and s3,2
should be aligned, but it is not the case.

Given m sequences, the anchors can formally be defined
as follows: Define a graph G({si}) with

where u jA denotes the sample mean.
Simulation methods
To evaluate the performance of the covariance estimator
we performed a Monte Carlo simulation on quartets and
compared our estimator to the sample covariance (also
referred to as the Monte Carlo covariance).
Sampling of quartets
The quartets were sampled uniformly from a variance
weighted least squares (WLS) tree on 352 species. The
WLS tree was inferred by the LeastSquaresTree function in
Darwin [17]. To obtain the input distance and variance
matrices for LeastSquaresTree we used data from the OMA
project [3]. The inter-species distances were determined as
average PAM distances over sets of groups of orthologs. A
total of 100 quartets were sampled, each one contributing
one data-point to the plots shown here.
Simulation procedure for one quartet
To explore the branch-length space, while preserving the
relative branch-length structure given by the WLS tree we
applied an uniformly distributed U(0.5,2) expansion/
contraction factor on each quartet. Then, we generated
40,000 times three random sequences of length m = {200,

500, 800} and mutated each of them along the dilated
model quartet. We assumed a Markovian model of evolution using the updated PAM matrices [18] and introduced
gaps of Zipfian distributed length [19].

We applied our covariance estimator on each of the
40,000 quartets and estimated its expected value and variance to compare it against the sample covariance which
we also refer to as Monte Carlo covariance. In the analysis
of the results, we treated the sample covariance as a reference value, as it constitutes an unbiased estimator for the
true covariance. The biases reported in the result section
are defined as the estimate of the expected value of our
covariance estimator minus the Monte Carlo covariance.
Note that being an estimator itself, the sample covariance's variance had also to be taken into account in the
analysis of the results.
