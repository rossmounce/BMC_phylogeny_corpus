Abstract
We provide a 2007 update on the bioinformatics research in the Asia-Pacific from the Asia Pacific
Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet), Asia's oldest bioinformatics organisation set up in 1998. From
2002, APBioNet has organized the first International Conference on Bioinformatics (InCoB)
bringing together scientists working in the field of bioinformatics in the region. This year, the
InCoB2007 Conference was organized as the 6th annual conference of the Asia-Pacific
Bioinformatics Network, on Aug. 27–30, 2007 at Hong Kong, following a series of successful events
in Bangkok (Thailand), Penang (Malaysia), Auckland (New Zealand), Busan (South Korea) and New
Delhi (India). Besides a scientific meeting at Hong Kong, satellite events organized are a preconference training workshop at Hanoi, Vietnam and a post-conference workshop at Nansha,
China. This Introduction provides a brief overview of the peer-reviewed manuscripts accepted for
publication in this Supplement. We have organized the papers into thematic areas, highlighting the
growing contribution of research excellence from this region, to global bioinformatics endeavours.

Introduction
The Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet, [13]) was established in 1998 [4] to promote the advancement of bioinformatics in the Asia Pacific region. Annual
meetings initially held at the Pacific Symposium of Biocomputing (1998–2001) bore fruit in 2002 as the APBioNet executive committee members facilitated the
inauguration of the International Conference on Bioinformatics in Bangkok, Thailand to promote the quality of
bioinformatics research in the region. Subsequent conferences followed in Penang, Malaysia (2003); Auckland,
New Zealand (2004); Busan, South Korea (2005) and

New Delhi, India (2006). InCoB 2007 was held at Hong
Kong [5].
APBioNet's initial efforts were focused on developing the
network infrastructure with the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) [6], capable of supporting the rapid dissemination of bioinformatics databases and computational
resources throughout the region. One of the services
developed since 1998 was the BioMirrors initiative [7]
which is currently being expanded to reach developing
countries [8]. By 2000, APBioNet started to focus on bioinformatics education and training of the life science com-

munity, with active participation in e-learning initiatives
such as the S* Life Science Informatics Alliance [9], to
bring bioinformatics into mainstream bioscience
research. Today, a critical mass of scientists in the region
is now available to extend the number of conferences in
bioinformatics, ranging from the Genome Informatics
Workshop (GIW) [10] based mainly in Japan to the Asia
Pacific Bioinformatics Conferences (APBC), InCoB [5],
the International Life Science Grid Workshops (LSGRID)
[11], the World Wide Workflow Grid conference (2007),
and many others. In recognition of the tremendous
growth of bioinformatics in the Asia Pacific, even the
International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB)
(MG is the immediate past President), to which APBioNet
is affiliated, chose to hold one of its annual flagship ISMB
conference in this region in 2003 [12]. High quality
research papers from Asia Pacific researchers have started
to appear in bioinformatics journals originating in the
region, such as the Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (World Scientific, Singapore) [13],
Applied Bioinformatics (originally from New Zealand)
and Bioinformation [14].
Since 2006, when bioinformatics research in the region
reached a standard, requiring international peer-reviewed
high-impact factor journal publication, we have
embarked on establishing international standards in bioinformatics research through this vehicle of a dedicated
BMC Bioinformatics supplement [15], now in its second
year. This year, we have manuscripts submitted by APBioNet members spanning several active research areas, such
as the boutique database development; data and text mining; ontologies and controlled vocabularies; analyses of
genome, transcriptome and protein structures; immunoinformatics; networks, pathways and systems biology,
and evolution and phylogenetic analysis.
Proceedings summary
Papers submitted to these proceedings were peer-reviewed
by at least two reviewers, from the APBioNet/InCoB editorial board members and external experts as required. Of
the 48 manuscripts short listed for oral presentation from
the 113 submission (oral presentation acceptance rate of
46%), only 22 papers were selected (48% of orals), leading to an overall acceptance rate of 19.5% of submissions.
The innovative bioinformatics research from the region is
reflected in these accepted papers coauthored from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iran, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, UK and USA, which fall into several general
themes as described in the following sections.
Data organization
The analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
is becoming a key research area in genomics, with implications for susceptibility to diseases, prognosis of treat-

ment regimens and for personalized healthcare. In this
realm, Kim et al. [16] have developed the SNP@Promoter
database to predict functional SNPs in putative promoter
regions and transcription factor binding sites.
Data and text mining
The difficulty in retrieving the vast amount of experimentally verified protein-protein data is addressed by a novel
text-mining approach developed by Tsai et al. [17], while
Ganapathiraju et al. [18] have combined latent semantic
analysis with sequence features for successful prediction
of transmembrane helices.
Ontologies and controlled vocabularies
In the emerging field of lipidomics, critical to the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's syndrome, bacterial
infections and cancer, the lack of a lipid ontology system
is ably addressed by Baker et al. [19]. The efficient querying of the Gene Onotology resource using a Resource
Description Framework is addressed by the GORouter system developed by Xu et al. [20]. Miotto et al. [21] provide
a practical application of semantic technologies by annotating over 40,000 influenza A protein sequences by combining information from more than 90,000 published
documents.
Genome and transcriptome analyses
To improve the performance of gene expression arrays,
Chen et al. [22] have developed a Unique Probe Selector
web service, while Zhao and coworkers [23] describe a
multivariate Bayesian model for the efficient identification of differentially expressed genes. Nagaraj et al. [24]
have evaluated the efficacy of their semi-automatic EST
analysis platform, ESTExplorer, in analysing data, and
demonstrate that computational tools can be used to
accelerate the process of gene discovery in EST sequencing
projects.
Structural bioinformatics
New methodologies for protein structure analysis using
graph theory [25] and domain boundary prediction using
an improved general regression network [26] are presented. Chelliah and Taylor [27] use functional site prediction to select correct 3D model structures. Structural
modeling has been applied to the transmembrane regions
of G protein-coupled receptors [28], to detect determinants in the mature peptide influencing signal peptide
cleavage in signal peptidase I [29] and to discriminate
between active and inactive allosteric modulator binding
conformational states in metabotropic glutamate receptors [30]. Molecular dynamic simulations provide an
insight into the stability of the core domain of the tumour
suppressor protein, p53 [31].

Immunoinformatics
In the global fight against disease, host-pathogen complementarity has been analysed using the AVANA system
[32] for mutual information analysis, while the HotSpot
Hunter [33] web service performs large-scale screening
and selection of candidate immunological hotspots in
pathogen proteomes.
Networks, pathways and systems biology
Protein-protein interactions and the networks they form
are essential to the fundamental understanding of how
biological pathways function. Kim et al. [34] describe the
protein interaction network in a model cyanobacterium
while Wang et al. [35] have developed a novel computational approach to integrate motif information and gene
expression data for regulatory network reconstruction.
Evolution and phylogenetic analyses
The evolution of genes, especially in response to pathogenic attack, is a complex process. Kong and Ranganathan
[36] have combined gene, protein, domain, motif and
evolutionary analyses of the potato inhibitor II family, to
understand the strategies developed by Solanaceae plants
for defense against pathogenic attacks. The informatics
challenges posed by large scale phylogenetic analysis have
prompted Singh et al. [37] to develop Quascade, a distributed computing platform, for phyloinformatics, for the
rapid analysis of viral sequences, and for monitoring
pathogen evolution.

Conclusion
As exemplified in this special issue, and by a wide range of
publications from other conferences mentioned in this
editorial, it is clear that Asia Pacific bioinformatics
research is thriving. To continue this trend, it is imperative
that bioinformatics education becomes entrenched in the
curriculum of our institutions of higher learning. In this
regard, the efforts of the Workshop on Education in Bioinformatics (WEB) [38] (as initiated by one of the coauthors, SR) and other training and policy meetings coordinated and facilitated by APBioNet, such the ASEANIndia Bioinformatics Workshop series, the ASEAN-China
Bioinformatics Workshop series and the East Asia Bioinformation Network meetings (coordinated by one of the
co-authors, TTW) [39], will play key roles in each Asia
Pacific country.
As a new generation of life science researchers trained to
practise in silico biology in addition to in vitro and in vivo
life science emerges, the need for resources will increase.
The network and computational infrastructure to support
such new demands will require a new biocyberinfrastructure to be provisioned in each locality, whether it is distributed computing facilities such as grid computing and
cloud computing, or in-campus centralized resources.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S1/S1

Growth in research quality, education excellence and
resource provisioning will need to take place hand-inhand. Organisations such as APBioNet and the recently
formed Asian Association for Societies in Bioinformatics
(AASBi) [40] are already formulating their policies to foster such growth. Collaborations with projects such as the
TEIN2 initiative [41] to build broadband regional network connectivity and with international organisations
such as ISCB will accelerate the sustained growth of bioinformatics in the Asia Pacific.
To this end, bioinformatics champions in each country
and in each institution are called to come forward to lead
this growth and show the way forward. Equally, each individual scientist is urged to adopt and promote techniques
in computational biology and bioinformatics as a routine
part of their arsenal of tools to be brought to bear on 21st
century biology.

Competing interests
