Abstract
Background: The autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is mostly caused by mutations in the
PKD1 (polycystic kidney disease 1) gene located in 16p13.3. Moreover, there are six pseudogenes of PKD1 that
are located proximal to the master gene in 16p13.1. In contrast, no pseudogene could be detected in the mouse
genome, only a single copy gene on chromosome 17. The question arises how the human situation originated
phylogenetically. To address this question we applied comparative FISH-mapping of a human PKD1-containing
genomic BAC clone and a PKD1-cDNA clone to chromosomes of a variety of primate species and the dog as a
non-primate outgroup species.
Results: Comparative FISH with the PKD1-cDNA clone clearly shows that in all primate species studied distinct
single signals map in subtelomeric chromosomal positions orthologous to the short arm of human chromosome
16 harbouring the master PKD1 gene. Only in human and African great apes, but not in orangutan, FISH with both
BAC and cDNA clones reveals additional signal clusters located proximal of and clearly separated from the PKD1
master genes indicating the chromosomal position of PKD1 pseudogenes in 16p of these species, respectively.
Indeed, this is in accordance with sequencing data in human, chimpanzee and orangutan. Apart from the master
PKD1 gene, six pseudogenes are identified in both, human and chimpanzee, while only a single-copy gene is present
in the whole-genome sequence of orangutan. The phylogenetic reconstruction of the PKD1-tree reveals that all
human pseudogenes are closely related to the human PKD1 gene, and all chimpanzee pseudogenes are closely
related to the chimpanzee PKD1 gene. However, our statistical analyses provide strong indication that gene
conversion events may have occurred within the PKD1 family members of human and chimpanzee, respectively.
Conclusion: PKD1 must have undergone amplification very recently in hominid evolution. Duplicative
transposition of the PKD1 gene and further amplification and evolution of the PKD1 pseudogenes may have arisen
in a common ancestor of Homo, Pan and Gorilla ~8 MYA. Reticulate evolutionary processes such as gene
conversion and non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) may have resulted in concerted evolution of
PKD1 family members in human and chimpanzee and, thus, simulate an independent evolution of the PKD1
pseudogenes from their master PKD1 genes in human and chimpanzee.

Background
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
is a late onset systemic disorder characterised by the progressive development of multiple fluid filled cysts in the
kidney, ultimately leading to renal failure [1]. Peters and
Sandkuijl [2] estimated that in affected individuals of
European descent approximately 85% of ADPKD is due to
mutations in the gene PKD1 (polycystic kidney disease 1),
located on chromosome 16p13.3. About 50 kb of the
PKD1 region in 16p13.3 is inserted and reiterated in several copies in 16p13.1, comprising six pseudogenes [3-5].
Only 3.5 kb of the PKD1 transcript, located at the 3'end of
the gene, is unique to PKD1 [6]. In contrast to the human
situation there is only one Pkd1 gene on mouse chromosome 17 and no further pseudogenes could be detected
[7]. The question arose how the human situation originated phylogenetically. Besides single-base-pair mutations, sequence duplications and chromosomal
rearrangements are the primary forces by which any
genome evolves over time [8,9]. Various models of
genomic duplications, e.g. the duplicative transposition
or the endoduplication, have been documented. The
duplicative transposition of a genomic block of material
(1–100 kb) leads to segmental duplications within a chromosome/genome [10], which are also known as low copy
repeat sequences, that mediate recurrent chromosomal
structural rearrangements [4]. These segmental duplications are often harbouring a part of a gene containing
intron and exon structures, which leads to the accumulation of unprocessed pseudogenes. Such duplications
appear to have arisen in very recent evolutionary time
(during the last 35 Myr), as judged by the high sequence
identity (90–100%) seen both in introns and exons [4,9].
Interestingly, human chromosome 16 is one of the most
enriched chromosomes for segmental duplications. They
are particularly clustered along the p arm of the chromosome [5]. In contrast to duplicative transpositions,
endoduplications originate from tandem duplication
events of local chromosomal regions mediated by unequal crossover. In the case of PKD1 both models of
genomic duplications can be implicated. First, the duplicative transposition as a hallmark for the separation of the
pseudogenes from the PKD1 gene and second, the
endoduplication among the pseudogenes as some of
them are located next to each other in the same orientation, indicating a tandem duplication event [3,11].
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the main
physical mapping tool to identify chromosomal rearrangements among closely related species [9]. Therefore
we applied comparative FISH-mapping of a human
PKD1-containing BAC clone and a PKD1-cDNA clone to
chromosomes of human, great apes, gibbon, Old World
and New World monkeys, lemurs and the dog as a nonprimate outgroup species. Here we report the localization

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/263

of the PKD1 gene and its pseudogenes. Moreover, with the
advent of whole-genome sequencing, a highly accurate
human genome sequence [4] and draft sequences of the
chimpanzee [12], the orangutan [13], the rhesus macaque
[14] and the common marmoset [15] genome have been
generated. This offers the possibility for phylogenetic and
comparative analyses of human and chimpanzee
sequences of PKD1 genes and pseudogenes taking the rhesus macaque as an outgroup.

Methods
Tissue samples
Blood samples of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PTR),
pygmy chimpanzee (Pan paniscus, PPA), lowland gorilla
(Gorilla gorilla gorilla, GGO), Sumatran orangutan (Pongo
pygmaeus abelii, PPYsu), and Bornean orangutan (Pongo
pygmaeus pygmaeus, PPYbo) were obtained from the Zoologisch-Botanischer Garten Wilhelma in Stuttgart, Germany, the Zoologischer Garten Berlin, Germany, and the
Zoologischer Garten Leipzig, Germany. Blood samples of
the lar gibbon (Hylobates lar, HLA), the proboscis monkey
(Nasalis larvatus, NLA), and the black-handed spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi, AGE) were also obtained from the
Zoologisch-Botanischer Garten Wilhelma in Stuttgart,
Germany. Blood probes of the Mueller's or grey gibbon
(Hylobates muelleri, HMU), the rhesus macaque (Macaca
mulatta, MMU), the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina, MNE), and the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta, LCA)
were received from the Zoologischer Garten Münster, Germany, the Zoologischer Garten Antwerpen, Belgium, and
the Deutsches Primatenzentrum in Göttingen, Germany.
From Prof. Dr. Y. Rumpler in Strasbourgh, France, we
received blood samples from the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur
catta, LCA), and the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus, EFU).
Blood probes from the domestic dog (Canis lupus f. familiaris, CFA) we got from Dr. R. Stanyon in Firenze, Italy.
Chromosome preparation
Standard chromosome preparation methods were applied
to peripheral lymphocyte cultures of human, primates
and the domestic dog [16].
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
Prior to FISH, the slides were treated with RNase followed
by pepsin digestion as described in [17]. FISH followed
essentially the methods already described in [16]. Chromosome in situ suppression was applied to the probes
BAC RP11-304L19 (Ensembl release 47: [AC009065]; Chr
16: 2,081,103 – 2,267,413) which harbours the complete
PKD1 gene and several additional genes. The BAC was
originally purchased from Research Genetics, Inc.,
(Huntsville, Ala, USA now Invitrogen GmbH, Germany)
and a 6.5 kb long partial PKD1-cDNA clone covering the
exons 15–31 of the PKD1 gene (generously provided by
Peter Harris; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension,

Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA).
In our FISH-experiments BAC clone RP11-304L19 was
referred to as "BAC", the PKD1-cDNA clone as "cDNA".
After FISH the slides were counterstained with DAPI (0.14
μg/ml) and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).
Fluorescence microscopy and imaging
Preparations were evaluated using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope equipped with single-band pass
filters for excitation of red, green and blue (Chroma Technologies, Brattleboro, VT). During exposures, only excitation filters were changed allowing for pixel-shift-free
image recording. Images of high magnification and resolution were obtained using a black-and-white CCD camera (Photometrics Kodak KAF 1400; Tucson, AZ)
connected to the Axiophot. Camera control and digital
image acquisition involved the use of an Apple Macintosh
Quadra 950 computer.
Sequence conservation analyses
Sequences orthologous to human PKD1 intron 30 were
identified in the whole genome assemblies of the rat
(rn4), mouse (NCBI Build 37; mm9), cat (felCat3), dog
(canFam2), horse (equCab1), and opossum (monDom4)
by using human intron 30 anchored with flanking exons
as a query sequence. All mammalian sequences were
extracted and multiple sequence alignments carried out
using CLUSTALW 2.0 [18]. Pairwise identities for intron
30 were calculated directly from the CLUSTALW alignments.
Phylogenetic analyses
Human sequences paralogous to the human PKD1 master
gene genomic locus (NC_000016: bp 2,078,712 –
2,125,900) were obtained from GenBank as follows:
PKD1P1: NG_002797; PKD1P2: NG_002795; PKD1P3:

NG_002796;
PKD1P4:
NG_002800;
PKD1P5:
NG_002798; PKD1P6: NG_002799. Phylogenetic analysis was focused on the largest intron (> 1.5 kb) common
for all gene loci (intron 30). Subsequently, primate
sequences orthologous and paralogous to the human
intron 30 sequence were identified in the whole genome
sequence assemblies of the chimpanzee (panTro2), orangutan (ponAbe2), and rhesus macaque (rheMac2).
Sequences were extracted, multiple sequence alignments
generated using CLUSTALW 2.0 [18] and gap-containing
positions removed. Pairwise identities of all sequences
were based on the CLUSTALW alignments. MODELTEST
[19] was used to select the model of nucleotide substitution best fitting the sequences. The nucleotide sequence
phylogeny was built using an ML model for nucleotide
data with the parameters defined by MODELTEST
(PAUP* 4.0; [20]). The PKD1 intron 30 topology was initially assessed using parsimony and distance-related nonparametric bootstrapping. No topological differences
were noted for the nucleotide phylogenies.
The topology of the phylogenetic tree was used to match
pairs of human and chimpanzee pseudogene copies
according to their comparable positions within the phylogram. As a reference, the pair of human and chimpanzee
master gene sequences was used. Subsequently, seven
independent multiple alignments were generated by
CLUSTALW 2.0 [18], gap-containing positions removed
and a phylogenetic tree created using Dnaml 3.5 c [21].
Branch lengths including confidence limits and p-values
(likelihood ratio tests) are documented in Table 1. Strong
indication for the correctness of the branch length is
noted when two gene/pseudogene copies had a p-value
that was less than 0.05 for five different types of statistical
tests.

Human and chimpanzee PKD1 intron 30 sequences were
further analyzed using GENECONV 1.81 [22]. Fragments
shared by a pair of DNA sequences in a multiple alignment presenting more consecutive identical polymorphic
sites in common than expected by chance are identified.
Evidence for gene conversion is indicated when a fragment had a p-value less than 0.05 after multiple correction of the p-values.

Results
The chromosomal location of PKD1 sequences was
defined by applying one- and two-colour fluorescence in
situ hybridisation (FISH) of two human-derived probes,
the PKD1-containing BAC clone RP11-304L19 and the
PKD1-cDNA clone HG 31918N2, to prometaphase or
metaphase chromosomes of human, great apes, gibbon,
Old World and New World monkeys, lemurs and the dog
as a non-primate outgroup species. During our search for
PKD1 sequences in primates and one representative of the
carnivores, the orthologous regions to the human short
arm chromosome 16 could be identified with the assistance of several published chromosomal painting papers.
Presenting our comparative FISH-results in human and
great apes we applied the system of orthologous numbering of human and great ape chromosomes [23].
Comparative mapping in human and great apes
FISH with the BAC clone on human chromosomes
revealed the expected prominent PKD1- signal distal in
16p13.3, as well as a signal cluster in 16p13.1, where the
pseudogenes are localized (Fig. 1a+c). Hybridizations
with the cDNA clone confirmed the localizations found
with the BAC clone, but showed weaker PKD1-signals in
16p13.3 (Fig. 1b+c).

For both chimpanzee and bonobo chromosomes 16 identical FISH-results were obtained. Three clearly separated
PKD1-signals could be detected with the BAC clone,
showing a strong PKD1-signal in distal 16p15, weaker signals in proximal 16p15 and a third distinct signal in
16p13, distal to the short arm heterochromatin (Fig.
1d+f). Detection with the cDNA clone could confirm
these three localizations, but showed weaker PKD1-signals in distal 16p15 (Fig. 1e+f). According to our results
the DAPI-bright heterochromatin of both the chimpanzee
and the bonobo chromosome 16 maps to the proximal
short arm on the side of the PKD1-signals, but not to the
proximal long arm as presented in the ideogrammatic
drawing in ISCN [24]. Indeed, this pericentric inversion
bringing the DAPI-bright heterochromatin to the proximal short arm of chimpanzee chromosome 16 was
recently established by means of molecular breakpoint
analysis [25].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/263

Likewise, in gorilla with the BAC clone three clearly separated PKD1-signals were detected in the short arm of chromosome 16. A strong signal was detected in distal 16p15,
and two weaker signals in proximal 16p15 and in 16p13,
respectively (Fig. 2a+c). Hybridizations with the cDNA
clone revealed the same PKD1-signal pattern but with
equal signal intensities for all three locations (Fig. 2b+c).
A different situation is given for the chromosome 16 of
the orangutan subspecies from Sumatra. Our FISH results
obtained with the BAC clone revealed strong PKD1-signals in distal 16p14 (Fig. 2d+f). Hybridizations with the
cDNA clone confirmed this result, however, weaker
PKD1-signals were detected (Fig. 2e+f). The same results
we achieved for the Bornean orangutan (data not shown).
Comparative mapping in gibbons and Old World monkeys
Hybridizations with the BAC and cDNA clones on chromosomes of Mueller's gibbon (HMU), and lar gibbon
(HLA) revealed strong PKD1-signals in distal 8p15 (Fig.
3a+b). The signals appear very strong and clustered after
using the BAC as a probe (Fig. 3a, HMU) but weaker when
the cDNA was used as a probe (Fig. 3b, HLA). This distal
region in 8p15 was shown to be orthologous to human
chromosome 16 [26,27]. FISH with BAC and cDNA
clones on chromosomes of the rhesus macaque (MMU)
and the pig-tailed macaque (MNE) revealed PKD1-signals
in the distal short arm of chromosome 20 (Fig. 3c, MMU
cDNA), the orthologous chromosome to human chromosome 16 [[28-30], see also http://www.biologia.uniba.it/
macaque]. Using both the BAC and the cDNA clones on
chromosomes of the proboscis monkey (NLA) PKD1-signals appeared again in the distal short arm of chromosome 20 (Fig. 3d), the orthologous chromosome to
human chromosome 16 [31].
Comparative mapping in a New World monkey, lemurs
and the dog
Performing FISH with BAC and cDNA clones on chromosomes of one representative of the New World monkeys,
the black-handed spider monkey, we could unequivocally
map distinct PKD1-signals distal in 1q26 (Fig. 4a, AGE),
which could be defined as the orthologous region to
human chromosome 16 [32]. Hybridizations with either
the BAC or cDNA clone on lemur chromosomes revealed
distinct PKD1-signals in the distal long arm of chromosome 24 of the brown lemur (Fig. 4b, EFU) and in the distal short arm of chromosome 2 of the ring-tailed lemur
(Fig. 4c, LCA). Chromosome 24 of the brown lemur could
be described as the orthologous chromosome to human
chromosome 16 [33], and chromosome 2 of the ringtailed lemur as orthologous to the short arm of human
chromosome 16 [34]. FISH with the PKD1 BAC clone on
chromosomes of the domestic dog revealed one very distinct PKD1-signal in the middle of the long arm of chro-

Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses
Based on the current genome reference sequence assemblies of human (NCBI build 36.3), chimpanzee
(panTro2), orangutan (ponAbe2), rhesus macaque
(rheMac2), and common marmoset (calJac1) we identified the master gene and 6 pseudogenes for PKD1 in
human (HSA PKD1P1-P6) and chimpanzee (PTR PKD1P1
[NW_001226536], PTR PKD1P2 [NW_001225854], PTR
PKD1P3
[NW_001225858],
PTR
PKD1P4
[NW_001226562], PTR PKD1P5 [NW_001225880], PTR
PKD1P6 [NW_001226561]), respectively, while only a
single-copy PKD1 gene was present in orangutan, rhesus
macaque and common marmoset. Pairwise sequence
comparisons of all pseudogene copies with the corresponding master gene revealed intron 30 as the longest
stretch (> 1.5 kb) of non-coding DNA present in all genes/
pseudogenes. It was previously shown that intron 45 of
the PKD1 master gene shows a remarkable sequence conservation [36]. To assess the sequence conservation of
intron 30, we performed multiple pairwise sequence comparisons of sequences orthologous to human intron 30
from six mammalian species (mouse, rat, cat, dog,
human, opossum). Except for the mouse-rat pairwise
alignment (83% nucleotide sequence identity), all other
percent identities ranged from 45% to 56% indicating no
sequence conservation. To analyze the phylogenetic relationships of master genes and pseudogenes, we compared
all intron 30 sequences by carrying out a CLUSTALW
alignment. Irrespective of the model of nucleotide substitution determined by MODELTEST [19] and the criteria
used to analyze the sequence data in PAUP*4.0b [20],
phylogenetic reconstruction of PKD1 using intron 30
always indicated that all human pseudogenes are closely
related to the human PKD1 gene, and all chimpanzee
pseudogenes are closely related to the chimpanzee PKD1
gene (Additional File 1). From an evolutionary point of
view, and also with regard to our FISH results in human
and great apes, it seems very unlikely that PKD1 pseudogenes originated independently in human and chimpanzee lineages. In addition, bearing in mind previous
reports on pseudogene-mediated gene conversion to
PKD1 [37-39], this prompted us to search for indications
of concerted evolution in the PKD1 family members in
human and chimpanzee.
Indications for concerted evolution
In a first approach we made use of the phylogenetic tree of
PKD1 intron 30 rooted on the rhesus macaque (Additional File 1). Based on the topology of this tree we
matched seven pairs of orthologous PKD1-loci from
human and chimpanzee (Table 1). Seven phylograms
independently created with the PKD1 master genes of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/263

orangutan and rhesus macaque together with one pair of
orthologous PKD1 loci from human and chimpanzee
showed for all PKD1 loci, with the exception of human
PKD1P3, almost identical branch lengths (expected
number of nucleotide substitutions/site) of 0.020–0.027.
This indicates that these pseudogenes may have originated before the human and chimpanzee lineages
diverged.
Subsequently, we calculated the pairwise nucleotide
sequence identities among all pseudogenes and the master genes of human, chimp, orangutan and rhesus
macaque (Additional file 2).
In general, the human paralogous pseudogenes as well as
the chimpanzee paralogous pseudogenes are more closely
related among each other, respectively, than are the
orthologous PKD1 master genes of both species. As
reviewed in Chen et al. [40] this result is a clear indication
that gene conversion may have occurred among PKD1
pseudogenes in human and chimpanzee, respectively.
In addition, the human and chimpanzee PKD1 intron 30
sequences were scanned for potential recombinant
sequences by GENECONV analysis, which is a well-established method for detecting partial gene conversion [41].
In human, four DNA-fragments ranging in size from 522
bp to 637 bp were identified which are significantly more
similar to each other than would be expected by chance,
even after correction for multiple testing (Additional file
2). Thus, GENECONV indicates partial gene conversion
between human PKD1 pseudogenes P2 and P3, P1 and
P4, P3 and P4, as well as P1 and P2, respectively. Surprisingly, in the chimpanzee, a gene conversion between the
PKD1 master gene and pseudogene 2 is indicated (Additional file 3).
Taken together, our three-pronged approach yielded substantial evidence for, at least, concerted evolution between
PKD1 pseudogene copies in human.

Discussion and conclusion
We applied comparative FISH-mapping with two human
derived probes, the PKD1-containing genomic BAC clone
RP11-304L19 and the PKD1-cDNA clone HG 31918N2,
to localize PKD1-sequences on chromosomes of a variety
of primates, including humans, and the dog as a non-primate outgroup-species.
In order to decide whether the PKD1-signals found in
each species can be regarded as a single-copy signal or if
duplications/amplifications must be taken into consideration, we compared our results with those obtained in
human, in which the master PKD1 gene maps to 16p13.3
and six PKD1 pseudogenes map to 16p13.1 [4,5], and in

the domestic dog, in which a single copy signal situation
for the orthologous PKD1 gene is established [42]. As
schematically summarized in Fig. 5, FISH with PKD1
clones in the human reveal a distinct and weaker signal in
the distal short arm in 16p13.3 and a more proximal signal-cluster in 16p13.1, which is in accordance with the
above cited human sequencing data. On the other hand,
hybridization of the genomic BAC clone on chromosomes of the domestic dog detect a very distinct single signal confirming the results of Dackowski et al. [42], and
allow us to map the orthologous PKD1 gene in 6q18 of
the dog. As in the human, in chimpanzee, bonobo and
gorilla a distinct and weaker signal can be detected in their
distal short arms after FISH with PKD1-cDNA. However,
in contrast to one proximal signal-cluster in human
16p13.1, two clearly separated signals appear in the proximal short arms of chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla chromosomes 16. Summarizing our FISH results for Homo,
Pan and Gorilla, the master PKD1 gene is located in the
subtelomeric short arms of the orthologous chromosomes 16, respectively, while the chromosomal arrangement of the amplified pseudogenes may have occurred by
further intrachromosomal rearrangements in a speciesspecific manner. This is not in contradiction to the work
of Misceo et al. [43], having shown that the short arm of
chromosome 16 is highly conserved in human and great
apes. The BAC clones from human 16p they have used for
comparative FISH (RP11-292B10, -291J20, -450G05, 360L15) neither interfere with the subtelomeric position
of the PKD1 gene, nor with the map positions of the PKD1
pseudogenes, at least in the human.
Interestingly, in both orangutan subspecies from Sumatra
and Borneo, and in all phylogenetically more distant species investigated only single PKD1-signals were detected at
chromosomal sites orthologous to human chromosome
16. Thus, we may infer a single-copy PKD1 gene for all
these species. Indeed, only a single PKD1 gene is present
in the current genome sequence assembly of the orangutan [13], the rhesus macaque [14], and the common marmoset [15]. Due to the limited resolution of the FISHtechnique we cannot exclude a duplication/amplification
of PKD1 at the chromosomal signal sites of the other primates investigated.
In conclusion, with regard to our comparative FISH-data
it seems very likely, that the original duplication of the
PKD1 gene and further amplification and evolution of the
PKD1 pseudogenes may have occurred in a common
ancestor of Homo, Pan and Gorilla ~8MYA.
Our combinatorial phylogenetic tree analysis using intron
30 from human and chimpanzee PKD1-loci, with orangutan and macaque as outgroup species, raises the impression of an independent evolution of the PKD1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/263

pseudogenes from their master PKD1 genes in human and
chimpanzee (Additional File 1). However, it should be
noted that a complex genome architecture with all PKD1
pseudogenes being embedded in segmental duplications
has been documented for the short arm of human [5] and
chimpanzee [12] chromosome 16. Indeed, several studies
have shown that reticulate evolutionary processes, such as
nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and gene
conversion occur within specific duplicon families, and
molecular clock analysis and calculations based on
sequence comparisons are confounded by these processes
[40,44-46]. Interestingly, there are several reports presenting evidence that mutations in human PKD1 are caused
via pseudogene-mediated gene conversion leading to
ADPKD [37,39], [48]. Our own statistical analyses provided clear indications for gene conversion and/or NAHR
that may have occurred among PKD1 family members in
human and chimpanzee, respectively. One further aspect
to be considered is the use of intron 30 for our sequence
analysis and phylogenetic tree building. Our decision to
focus on intron 30 was directed by the fact that the PKD1
exons are densely packed on the genomic level and intron
30 is the largest intron (> 1.5 kb) present in all PKD1 loci
in human and chimpanzee, respectively. On the other
hand, the evolutionarily highly conserved last intron
(intron 45) of PKD1 [36] raises the question of whether
there are other forces affecting intron 30 evolution. However, we did not find evidence of high sequence conservation in intron 30.
In conclusion, notwithstanding our results using intron
30 for phylogenetic tree building, it seems more likely that
all six PKD1-pseudogenes evolved in a common ancestor
of human and chimpanzee. After separation of both lineages there was internal correction of the genes/pseudogenes resulting in co-evolution of these genes within each
species. By inference from an equally complex FISH-signal
pattern of PKD1 shown in gorilla 16p, the species gorilla
may well be included in this scenario of PKD1 evolution,
suggesting that the original duplication of PKD1 may have
occurred before gorillas and humans diverged ~8MYA.
