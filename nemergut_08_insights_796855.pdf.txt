Abstract
Background: Integrons are mechanisms that facilitate horizontal gene transfer, allowing bacteria
to integrate and express foreign DNA. These are important in the exchange of antibiotic resistance
determinants, but can also transfer a diverse suite of genes unrelated to pathogenicity. Here, we
provide a systematic analysis of the distribution and diversity of integron intI genes and integroncontaining bacteria.
Results: We found integrons in 103 different pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, in six major
phyla. Integrons were widely scattered, and their presence was not confined to specific clades
within bacterial orders. Nearly 1/3 of the intI genes that we identified were pseudogenes, containing
either an internal stop codon or a frameshift mutation that would render the protein product nonfunctional. Additionally, 20% of bacteria contained more than one integrase gene. dN/dS ratios
revealed mutational hotspots in clades of Vibrio and Shewanella intI genes. Finally, we characterized
the gene cassettes associated with integrons in Methylobacillus flagellatus KT and Dechloromonas
aromatica RCB, and found a heavy metal efflux gene as well as genes involved in protein folding and
stability.
Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that the present distribution of integrons is due to multiple
losses and gene transfer events. While, in some cases, the ability to integrate and excise foreign
DNA may be selectively advantageous, the gain, loss, or rearrangment of gene cassettes could also
be deleterious, selecting against functional integrases. Thus, such a high fraction of pseudogenes
may suggest that the selective impact of integrons on genomes is variable, oscillating between
beneficial and deleterious, possibly depending on environmental conditions.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is effected through some
combination of the activity of mobile gene elements and/
or recipient cellular enzyme systems. In the most general

terms, the process of horizontal gene transfer requires several, distinct steps [1]. The mechanisms and controls over
processes for physically transferring DNA into recipient
cells (i.e., transformation, conjugation and transduction)

have received significant attention in the literature. However, the ability of cells to replicate and express foreign
DNA is also essential for the transferred genes to become
prevalent in the population through natural selection [1].
Mobile gene elements can thus be important in promoting HGT because they can contain origins of replication
(ORIs) and/or promoters to facilitate the replication and
transcription of foreign DNA. ORIs and promoters vary
widely both within and between different species of bacteria, and may be more likely to be recognized by the cellular machinery of closely related organisms than more
distantly related species, limiting the phylogenetic distance over which certain mobile gene elements can be
transferred. However, many cross-phyla [e.g., [2]] and
even cross-domain [e.g., [3]] gene transfer events have
been documented. Although broad host range plasmids
[4,5] and phages [6] play important roles in these long
distance transfers, questions remain about the potential
role of other mobile elements.
Integrons [7], are gene elements which may also play an
important role in the transfer of genes between distantly
related lineages. Integrons facilitate the integration [8],
excision [9], and rearrangement [10] of mobile genes
which contain attC (also referred to as 59-be) recombination sites [8,11], called "gene cassettes" [12]. Once integrated, the gene cassette is then expressed from the Pc
promoter Integrons catalyze the integration of foreign
genes into a DNA molecule that is already recognized by
the native replication machinery (chromosome or plasmid), and under the control of a promoter that allows
gene expression in the host. Thus, this mechanism permits
organisms to sample from the diversity of gene cassettes in
their local environment without the need for host recognition of foreign promoters or ORIs, and may therefore
facilitate gene transfer among highly divergent groups of
bacteria.
Integrons are classified according to the sequence of the
IntI protein. The first integron discovered, the class 1 integron, is now known to be important in the dissemination
of antibiotic resistance genes in both Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria [14]. These integrons are typically
found on plasmids or transposons, which catalyze their
own mobility. Class 1 integrons have been found in association with dozens of different resistance genes [reviewed
in [14]], and have been found in environments ranging
from hospitals to poultry litter [15,16]. Other types of
integrons, including classes 2, 3, 9, and an unnamed class
found on a Vibrio salmonicida plasmid, (GenBank accession number AJ277063) have been similarly found on
mobile elements and in association with antibiotic resistance genes [17-20]. Collectively, these are sometimes
called "mobile integrons" or "multi-resistance" integrons;
however, because the genomic location and associated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/261

gene cassettes are not stable features of integrons, this
nomenclature has been discouraged [21,22]. Indeed, integrons associated with antibiotic genes have been mobilized several times in the history of their evolution [23],
leading to a major public health concern.
Genome sequencing projects [17,23,24] have revealed a
wide variety of intI genes from phylogenetically diverse
bacteria (no reports of integrons in the Eucarya or Archaea
have been made to date), and a recent study demonstrates
that they are present in ~10% of sequenced genomes [23].
Boucher et al. [23] used BLAST searches and identified
integrons in the genomes of organisms from the Spirochaetes, Cyanobacteria, Chlorobi, Planctomycetes and the γ,
β, δ, and ε Proteobacteria. Mazel [17] identified two major
clades of intI genes, one arising from organisms living in
soil/freshwater environments and the other found in
marine bacteria. Cultivation-independent studies have
revealed an enormous diversity of intI genes in a variety of
environmental samples [25]. Likewise, a plethora of different types of gene cassettes, many having no obvious
role in pathogenicity or resistance phenotypes, have been
found associated with these integrase genes [e.g., [26-28]],
and
in
environmental
metagenomic
samples
[25,27,29,30]. In some cases, such as within species of the
genus Vibrio, integrase genes are found in association with
over 100 gene cassettes [31-33], suggesting that these elements play a major role in the evolution of these organisms. Thus, it has been hypothesized that their wide
distribution and in some cases major genome load may
make these elements important in the evolution of a
diverse, environmentally-relevant suite of bacteria.
However, many fascinating questions remain about the
nature of integrons. For example, why are these potentially adaptive elements found in some organisms but not
in others? One major force in the evolution of integrons is
thought to be mobility – through association with plasmids or transposons – and much evidence suggests that
integrons themselves are transferred between bacterial lineages [23,25]. However, there is support for a good deal of
vertical inheritance for integrons as well [23,25]. Here, we
use genomic analyses to examine integron diversity and
distribution. We also describe the types of gene cassettes
found in association with two organisms, further emphasizing the diversity of genes that integrons can mobilize.

Results and Discussion
Which lineages contain integrons?
We used BLAST to search for intI genes in organisms
whose whole genomes have been partially or completely
sequenced, and to query sequences in the nr GenBank
database. Although the promoter and attI recombination
site are integral parts of both integron structure and function, we chose to broaden our definition and search for

just the presence of integron integrase genes because IntI
can also catalyze recombination events between the attC
site and secondary sites [20,34,35]. These events occur at
low frequencies, but may be important for bacterial evolution because they result in the insertion of a gene cassette that is flanked by a single recombination site,
significantly lowering the possibility of IntI-mediated
excision [35]. Thus, we use the terms "integron integrase
gene" "intI", and "integron" interchangeably.
We identified a total of 103 different bacteria that contain
integron integrase genes (the typically mobile integrons
were excluded from this analysis but have been reviewed
elsewhere [14]). We found intI genes in eighteen different
bacterial orders within six divisions, including the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria,
Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes (Additional File 1), expanding on the diversity recovered from
the most recent survey [23]. These phylogenetically
diverse organisms are found in a variety of both oxic and
anoxic environments, and their metabolisms range from
heterotrophy to photoautotrophy. The diversity of integron-containing organisms suggests that either these elements are ancient, playing significant roles in shaping
microbial genomes over long timescales, or that the evolutionary advantage of being able to catalyze integronmediated gene transfer has led to the more recent, rapid
dispersal of integrons among disparate bacterial lineages.
There are many biases associated with the selection of
organisms for both laboratory work and for whole
genome sequencing, so the lack of a particular type of
organism or group of organisms in Additional File 1
should not be interpreted as evidence for the lack of an
integron (with the exception of within specific, entirely
sequenced genomes, see below). However, some divisions and subdivisions have been the targets of major
sequencing efforts yet are notably absent from this table,
including organisms within the Actinobacteria (37 complete genomes sequenced representing 3 orders), and the
Firmicutes (103 complete genomes representing 7
orders). It is unknown whether integrons are missing
from these lineages all together, or if they are merely
absent from the specific organisms selected for sequencing projects. This uncertainty is especially interesting in
light of the importance of Gram positive organisms as
environmental reservoirs of class 1 integrons [15]. In
addition, none of the 54 α-proteobacterial genomes, representing 6 orders, contain integrons, yet these elements
are found in the γ, β, δ, and ε proteobacterial subdivisions
(Additional File 1). To our knowledge, no type 1 integrons
have been found in the α-proteobacteria.
Nearly one third of the intI genes that we uncovered are
predicted to be non-functional, containing either a stop

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/261

codon, a frameshift mutation, or a major insertion or
deletion that would likely render them inactive (*, Additional File 1). The Vibrios appear to be an exception to this
rule, as only 4% of intI genes from this group are pseudogenes. Another interesting feature of integron distribution
is that more than one-fifth of all integron-containing lineages harbor more than one intI gene (Additional File 1).
This is likely an underestimate of the fraction of organisms with two or more genes: fewer than half of the isolates in Additional File 1 are completely sequenced, and
the remainder may contain additional integrase genes in
the unsequenced regions. Again, the Vibrios differ from the
rest, as only 4% of these species with integrons contain
multiple integrase genes.
We mapped the integron phenotype (putative functional
genes in green, putative non-functional in purple) onto a
16S rRNA gene tree of all orders of bacteria that contain
integrons (again, for simplicity, the typically mobile integrons were excluded). All species reported in Additional
File 1 were included in this phylogeny as integron-positive, while all organisms whose genomes are completely
sequenced and do not contain intI genes were designated
integron-negative. The distribution of integron-positive
lineages suggests that integron-containing organisms
comprise a significant fraction of the phylogenetic diversity within these bacterial orders (Figure 1). Specifically,
67.1% of the total branch length within the 16S rRNA
gene tree leads to modern genomes that contain integrons, indicating that less than a third of the phylogenetic
diversity falls only within integron-negative lineages. UniFrac analysis [36,37] showed significant phylogenetic
clustering (P < 0.001 using unweighted UniFrac significance test and P test through the UniFrac web site), indicating that closely related lineages tend to share integronpositive or integron-negative status more than would be
expected by chance.
The current phylogenetic distribution of integrons supports that loss may be an important feature of integron
evolution (Figure 1). In some cases this pattern is apparent even within strains of the same species: for example,
Shewanella baltica OS195 contains two intI genes, while
Shewanella baltica OS155 lacks integrons. Holmes et al.
[38] also reported on the spotty nature of integron distribution, finding that two of three isolates of Pseudomonas
stutzeri contained intI genes. Although some of these differences may also be due to horizontal transfer of integrons between closely related species [23], the abundance
of pseudogenes suggests that decay and subsequent loss
are also important processes. While intra-species differences in gene cassette composition is predicted and often
observed [31,32,39,40] due to the inherent integration/
excision activity of integrons, these phylogenetically
small-scale differences in the presence or absence of inte-

grons is not an expected feature of a non-mobile gene element. Again, the genus Vibrio is a notable exception to this
pattern, as all species examined to date harbor integrons.
What is the evolutionary history of intI genes?
We performed extensive phylogenetic analyses using a
variety of optimality criteria (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony and minimum evolution) on all intI genes and the predicted protein
sequences listed in Additional File 1 as well as on the typically mobile intI genes (Figure 2). For all methods, intI
genes formed a supported clade, exclusive of the XerC/
XerD outgroup [17,41], with a total of fifteen intI clades
that were supported by nearly every analysis (Figure 2).
Although our tree structure hints at the recently described
soil/freshwater and marine groups [17], these clades are
not supported by all of our phylogenetic analyses. Each
clade of integrase genes primarily originates from organisms within a specific bacterial lineage (clades 1–15, with
taxon names in Figure 2; colored boxes in Additional File
1). The vast majority of these intI genes have been identified by sequence similarity only; thus their functions
remain unknown. However, the seven intI genes that have
been functionally characterized in vivo are widely distributed throughout the intI phylogeny (highlighted red in
Figure 2), supporting a similar role for the uncharacterized genes in the integration and excision of gene cassettes
[20,38,42-45]].

The integrase gene tree suggests some similarities between
integron and organismal evolutionary relationships, and
in many cases the intI genes found within supported
clades derive largely from a related group of bacteria (Figure 2). However, there is some evidence for incongruent
intI and organismal phylogenies, and some of these
inconsistencies may be due to horizontal gene transfer
events. As stated above, many organisms contain multiple
intI genes, and in some cases, the intI phylogeny suggests
that a horizontal gene transfer event may have given rise
to one of the genes (Figure 2, Additional File 1). For example, a gene from each of the deltaproteobacterial species
Geobacter metallireducens and Geobacter lovleyi falls just outside of integrase clade 2, which contains genes primarily
from within the Betaproteobacteria. These organisms harbor at least two intI genes (G. lovleyi is not completely
sequenced yet and therefore may contain more), but the
other genes fall into a supported clade with sequences
from the Deltaproteobacteria (clade 15, Figure 2). This is
also true for Shewanella baltica and Shewanella woodyi,
which both contain two intI genes, one which falls in
clade 9 and the other which falls in clade 8.
Indeed, intI mobility is a character state that is widely distributed across the integrase phylogenetic tree – found in
clades 5, 7, 8, and 9 – supporting that the mobile pheno-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/261

type has arisen multiple times (Figure 2, circled genes)
[23]. Additionally, although at first glance, integron integrase genes roughly fall into supported clades reflecting
the organisms from which they originated (Figure 2),
there are significant differences between integrase and 16S
rRNA gene phylogenies [25]. We performed likelihoodbased tests for congruence [46] on the intI and 16S rRNA
gene phylogenies for Deltaproteobacteria (clade 15) and
Shewanella (clade 10). In all cases, there were significant
differences between the two phylogenies (Figure 3). However, these data are somewhat difficult to interpret
because in many cases the relationships among several
"housekeeping" genes (e.g., fusA, rpoA, recA, gyrA) were
also determined to be significantly different from the 16S
rRNA phylogenies, and from one another (Figure 3).
Assuming that the 16S rRNA gene acts as the most accurate metric of genomic evolution, several factors could
lead to the lack of concordance between 16S rDNA and
integrase relationships. The presence of paralogous intI
genes, selection, and horizontal gene transfer events could
all lead to a lack of agreement between organismal and
integrase phylogenies. Paralogous genes are certainly a
factor, as many species contain multiple genes, some
which appear to have arisen recently within the genome
from gene duplication events (Additional File 1, Figure 2).
However, even when these events are ignored, and all
nodes that are shared between the 16S rRNA gene tree and
any paralog are identified, there is a notable lack of concordance. Genetic exchange may also provide a plausible
explanation for these patterns, and the association of integrons with transposons and transposase genes provides a
possible mechanism for transfer [23]. Finally, differential
selection on the 16S rRNA gene and the integrase gene
could also contribute to a lack of agreement between phylogenetic reconstructions, and is an interesting possibility
given the evidence for positive selection on IntI proteins
(see below).
Pseudogenes
As mentioned above, pseudogenes make up more than
one third of all integrase genes uncovered in this study.
Others have found intI pseudogenes in a number of different bacteria [19,24,39]. For example, the typically mobile
class 2 integron integrase, intI2, is a non-functional pseudogene, the activity of which can be recovered by suppressing the internal stop codon [19]. Additionally, intI
pseudogenes were prevalent in a recent survey of integrons from Xanthomonas strains [39]. Pseudogenes are
also abundant in molecular phylogenetic surveys of intI
genes from environmental samples, comprising 4–20% of
total genes in these collections (Nemergut and Schmidt,
unpublished data; Rodriguez-Minguela et al., unpublished
data,
accession
numbers
DQ282376–
DQ2822194). In general, pseudogenes are relatively rare
features of bacterial genomes, as non-functional genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/261

typically comprise only 2–8% of all genes in free-living
bacteria [47,48]. Therefore, the high percentage of
pseudo-integrase genes, or "pseudo-integrons", that we
uncovered is surprising. Recent analyses suggest that pseudogenes are likely to be of contemporary origin, as the
same pseudogenes are typically not found in the genomes
of closely related bacteria [47,48]. Indeed, orthologs of
both functional and non-functional integrases are found
in different strains of the same species of Xanthomonas
[39]. The widespread phylogenetic distribution of pseudointegrons within the bacteria (Additional File 1, Figure
1) implies that decay is a common feature across lineages.
Likewise, the scattered distribution of pseudogenes on the
intI phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), suggests that gene decay
is a frequent process across different classes of integrase
genes. For the most part, these appear to be randomly
arrayed on the tree, supporting the hypothesis that pseudogenes decay rapidly and are quickly removed from
genomes [47,48]. However, integrases within clades 4 and
15 are notable exceptions. Interestingly, despite the minimal evolutionary distance among the pseudogenes found
in clade 4, these mutations all appear to have originated
independently by unique frameshift mutations. This may
be an artifact of biased sampling, or it may suggest that
strong purifying selection is acting on genes in clade 4,
contributing to their rapid decay. In contrast, a single gene
fusion event characterizes an entire group of integrase
genes within clade 15, and these proteins are an average of
~120 amino acids longer than other IntI proteins. As mentioned previously, pseudogenes are not generally conserved between closely related species [47,48] as they are
typically lost at rates higher than speciation. Thus, the
shared gene fusion event within clade 15 may suggest that
these are actually functional genes.

light yellow boxes indicate that one test revealed significant
(p < 0.05) differences and yellow boxes indicate that both

Pseudogenes are relatively common features of some
eucaryotic genomes, particularly vertebrates [49], where
they arise from either retrotransposition or DNA duplication events. In bacteria, duplication processes give rise to
pseudogenes as well; however, they are also thought to
develop via the decay of native single-copy genes and following failed horizontal transfers [50]. Our phylogenetic
analysis suggests that many of the pseudointegrons that
we identified appear to have arisen through intragenomic
duplication events (a nearly identical functional integrase
and pseudogene within the same genome), while others
appear to have entered the cell through gene transfer processes (a pseudogene from a different clade in the same
genome with a functional gene from the "expected"
clade), and still others appear to have been resident genes
that are undergoing decay (only one pseudogene from the
"expected" clade in the genome) (Figure 2, Additional File
1). In a recent multigenome analysis of bacterial and
archaeal pseudogenes, Liu and coworkers revealed that

Page 7 of 12

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:261

while pseudogenes occur in only approximately 1–5% of
total genes, the proportion of integrase pseudogenes are
significantly higher, suggesting a different evolutionary
dynamic for this class of genes [50]. While, in some cases,
the ability to integrate and excise foreign DNA may be
selectively advantageous, the gain, loss or rearrangment of
gene cassettes could also be deleterious, selecting against
functional integrases. Thus, such a high fraction of pseudogenes may suggest that the selective impact of integrons
on genomes is variable, oscillating between beneficial and
deleterious, possibly depending on environmental conditions. Other interpretations are possible as well, and, as
noted by one insightful reviewer, the formation of integrase pseudogenes may result when organisms inhabit
environments without gene cassettes, or when recombination processes result in the deletion of gene cassettes that
maintain the array (e.g., toxin genes [51]).
Finally, there is mounting evidence that not all sequences
which have been identified as pseudogenes are without a
biological function. In some organisms, for example,
pseudogenes appear to be important in the generation of
variation within multigene families, including both antibody and antigen determinants [52,53]. These pseudogenes act as a reservoir of sequence diversity and promote
the rapid diversification of gene families through intragenomic recombination events. In many of these cases,
genes are under "positive selection" pressures, and mutation (i.e., diversification) is favored. A hallmark of genes
undergoing positive selection is an increased ratio of nonsynonymous (protein altering) to synonymous (non-protein altering) mutations [54] within groups of closely
related genes.
Thus, we examined the selection dynamics across integrase proteins (Figure 4A). Heuristic dN/dS (also called
KA/KS) pairwise comparisons were made between proteins
within integrase clade 7 to the functionally characterized
intI from Vibrio cholerae. This comparison reveals two
excursions in the dN/dS ratios above 1, suggesting mutational hotspots ranging from codon ~1 to ~50 and from
codon ~160 to ~220. However, when these regions were
further examined under the best-fit evolutionary model
[54], only the N-terminal domain showed evidence for
positive selection (data not shown). This motif is thought
to be important in the recognition of attC and attI sites
[45], and it is possible that selection for mutation in this
region would expand or change the consensus sequences
that an integrase is able to recognize. Alternatively, as
pointed out by one reviewer, this site is also involved in
the expression of gene cassettes [13]; thus, mutation in
this region may modulate gene cassette mRNA levels in
the host cell. There was a suggestion of a similar pattern
for the Shewanella proteins in clade 10; however, no pair-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/261

wise comparisons were significantly greater than 1 when
variable evolutionary rates were considered (Figure 4B).
Characterization of new cassettes
Finally, we characterized the integron-associated gene cassettes in two species: Methylobacillus flagellatus KT, an obligate methylotroph; and Dechloromonas aromatica RCB, a
perchlorate reducing bacterium (Figure 5). These organisms are found in different orders of the subphylum βproteobacteria and contain intI genes that group with
clade 2 (Figure 2). Several of the cassettes that we identified were classified as hypothetical proteins, and pBLAST
provided no further clues as to the potential functions of
the proteins coded for by these genes. However, several
interesting putative functions for gene cassettes were
assigned, including a heavy metal (Co, Zn, Cd) pump
(CAT) and a heat shock protein (HSP). Additionally, both
integron arrays contained genes related to the c-type peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase family, which are involved
in protein folding.

Conclusion
These data reveal several interesting and unusual features
of integron evolution, some that appear to be consistent
across intI and/or organismal clades. First, the present distribution of integrons is likely due to multiple loss events
(Figure 1) as well as horizontal gene transfers (Figure 3).
Second, many organisms contain multiple, sometimes
phylogenetically distinct, integrons (Additional File 1,
Figure 2). Third, a high percentage of intI genes are nonfunctional (Additional File 1; Figures 1, 2). Fourth, positive selection seems to be occurring on one IntI domain,
at least in the vibrios and perhaps in Shewanella (Figure 4).
And, finally, intI genes form supported clades that roughly
reflect the order of the species from which they originated,
but in some cases there are obvious exceptions (Figure 2,
Additional File 1). Together, these results highlight the
dynamic nature of integron evolution, and provide further support that these genetic elements may be important
in the genomic fluidity of a large number of diverse bacteria.

Integrase phylogeny
The Enterobacter cloacae IntI1 protein sequence (GenBank
accession ABO46012) was used to search the nr GenBank
database with the PSI-BLAST algorithm and to query the
NCBI microbial genome database using the tBLASTn algorithm on April 20, 2007 [55]. All coding region matches
that contained the intI integrase additional domain [56],
or intI patch [57] were selected for subsequent analysis, as
were the corresponding putative translated sequences.
Pseudogenes were identified as those coding regions that
were either interrupted by a frameshift mutation or a stop
codon, or as proteins that were at least 20% larger or

The ratio
The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations over the integrase sequence for Vibrio (A) from clade
7 and Shewanella (B) from clade 10. Proteins were aligned in MAFFT [58] and used to generate a DNA alignment. DNA
alignments were used to generate pairwise comparisons with the Vibrio cholerae intI (A), or Shewanella oneidensis intI (B) and the
ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions at each codon position was calculated. The figure legends show a consensus cladogram (maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and distance) for the integrase genes.

smaller than the intI1 gene. For phylogenetic analyses of
pseudogenes, we selected only the translated region that
aligned to the IntI1 protein and the corresponding DNA
sequence. For pseudogenes that contained multiple mutations, alignable regions of both DNA and proteins were
concatenated so that their sequences were contiguous. It is
of note that NB231_00025, an intI sequence from Nitrococcus mobilis Nb-231, may not be a pseudogene, as it was
found on the end of a shotgun sequence and may be complete within the contiguous genome.
The online version of the sequence alignment program
MAFFT [58] was employed to align the amino acid
sequences and four outgroup sequences (XerC and XerD
from Escherichia coli and Thiobacillus denitrificans [17,41])
using the following settings: FFT-NS-I, and the
BLOSUM45 model. Amino acid alignments were manually adjusted, and any unalignable regions, particularly
from within pseudogenes, were trimmed and removed
from further analysis. Next, a Python script was developed
to guide the insertion of gaps into the corresponding coding DNA sequence for the production of a DNA-based
codon alignment (Robeson, unpublished program).
These coding DNA data sets were analyzed using the parallel version of MrBayes [59] and run anywhere from two
million to eight million generations in order to achieve
convergence under the GTR+I+G model of evolution, as
selected via MrModelTest [60]. Consensus trees from the
analyses were constructed in PAUP*4.0 [61] after typically
removing ~10% of the burnin trees. Parsimony phylogenetic reconstructions were performed using the PHYLIP
[62] software package and subjected to 100 bootstrap replicates with 10 randomizations of taxa input order for
each bootstrap. Maximum Likelihood analysis used the

GTRGAMMA model and was subjected to 100 boostrapped replicates in RAxML-VI-HPC [63].
We performed likelihood-based tests for congruence [46]
on the intI, 16S rRNA, fusA, rpoA, recA, gyrA gene trees for
Deltaproteobacteria (clade 15) and Shewanella (clade 10).
For each comparison, we downloaded DNA sequences
from Genbank for all available phyla, and generated trees
using distance, parsimony and likelihood optimality criteria. Likelihood tests were executed in PAUP*4.0 as
described previously [25].
16S rRNA gene phylogeny
For all organisms found to contain integrons, available
16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from GenBank.
We were unable to obtain 16S rRNA gene sequences for all
species with integrons; specifically: Alteromonadales bacterium TW-7, Vibrio sp. DAT722 [31], Xanthomonas sp. CIP
102397 [24], Vibrio cholerae MAK 757, Vibrio cholerae
MZO-3, the Xanthomonas DAR strains [39], Shewanella
putrefaciens CIP 69.34 [24]. In addition, because of the
lack of availability, several of the 16S rRNA genes that we
obtained were not from the same strain that the integron
was identified in, specifically: Listonella anguillarum, Listonella pelagia, Vibrio mimicus, Vibrio metschnikovii, Vibrio
natriegens, Vibrio salmonicida, and Xanthomonas badrii. All
told, we found integrons in eighteen different bacterial
orders. 16S rRNA genes from integron containing lineages
were aligned with 16S rRNA genes from completely
sequenced bacteria from within these same eighteen
orders that lacked integrons, as well as with five archaeal
16S rRNA gene outgroup sequences: Pyrobaculum clidifontis, Aeropyrum pernix, soil clone cren34kb, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Methanosphaera stadtmanae.
We used the online NAST-based algorithm available from

the Greengenes website [64] to align the 16S rRNA genes,
imported alignments into ARB and exported the alignment using lanemaskPH to remove hypervariable regions
[65]. MODELTEST [66] was used to estimate the best-fit
model of sequence evolution for 16S rRNA gene alignments, and a minimum evolution-based phylogenetic
reconstruction was generated in PAUP 4.0. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods yielded
largely similar phylogenic reconstructions but were not
shown.

dN/dS ratios and mutational frequencies
Integrase protein alignments for sequences in clades 7 and
10 were selected for pairwise comparisons to the functionally characterized Vibrio cholerae and Shewanella oneidensis
IntI proteins, respectively. Only putative functional integrase proteins that were >95% different from all others
and that originated from within the genus Vibrio or
Shewanella were analyzed. Amino acid alignments were
generated using MAFFT with the parameters described
above. Next, a codon-based DNA alignment was constructed using our Python script. DNA alignments were
then formatted to compare two sequences at a time, using
the Shewanella oneidensis and Vibrio cholerae intI genes as
reference sequences. DNA alignments were submitted to
the online program SNAP [67] which calculates the
change in nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS)
substitutions at each codon position. dN/dS ratios were
calculated by integrating over 20 nucleotide positions,
and the two-times greater frequency of synonymous sites
in a codon was corrected for by dividing this value by 2.
dN/dS ratios were plotted against codon position integrated over twenty nucleotide positions. Finally, we used
PAML [68] to calculate the dN/dS ratio and likelihood values of a variety of evolutionary models [54].
