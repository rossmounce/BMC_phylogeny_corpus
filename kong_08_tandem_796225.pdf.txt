Abstract
Background: The Potato type II (Pot II) family of proteinase inhibitors plays critical roles in the
defense system of plants from Solanaceae family against pests. To better understand the evolution
of this family, we investigated the correlation between sequence and structural repeats within this
family and the evolution and molecular adaptation of Pot II genes through computational analysis,
using the putative ancestral domain sequence as the basic repeat unit.
Results: Our analysis discovered the following interesting findings in Pot II family. (1) We classified
the structural domains in Pot II family into three types (original repeat domain, circularly permuted
domain, the two-chain domain) according to the existence of two linkers between the two domain
components, which clearly show the circular permutation relationship between the original repeat
domain and circularly permuted domain. (2) The permuted domains appear more stable than
original repeat domain, from available structural information. Therefore, we proposed a multiplerepeat sequence is likely to adopt the permuted domain from contiguous sequence segments, with
the N- and C-termini forming a single non-contiguous structural domain, linking the bracelet of
tandem repeats. (3) The analysis of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates ratio in Pot II
domain revealed heterogeneous selective pressures among amino acid sites: the reactive site is
under positive Darwinian selection (providing different specificity to target varieties of proteinases)
while the cysteine scaffold is under purifying selection (essential for maintaining the fold). (4) For
multi-repeat Pot II genes from Nicotiana genus, the proteolytic processing site is under positive
Darwinian selection (which may improve the cleavage efficiency).
Conclusion: This paper provides comprehensive analysis and characterization of Pot II family, and
enlightens our understanding on the strategies (Gene and domain duplication, structural circular
permutation and molecular adaptation) of Solanaceae plants for defending pathogenic attacks
through the evolution of Pot II genes.

Background
Members of potato type II proteinase inhibitor family
(Pot II) are one of the major serine proteinase inhibitor
families which are mainly found in higher plants from
Solanaceae families [1]. The accumulations of Pot II inhibitors are always in response to stress, infection and
wounding. They are one important measurement for
plants to defense against predators or diseases. Intensive
researches have been conducted on proteinase inhibitors
(PIs) from this family. Interesting phenomena in Pot II
family (such as tandem duplication, domain swapping
and fold circular permutation [2,3]) make this family a
good example to study gene evolution and protein folding. Members within this family have been identified with
different numbers of tandem sequence repeat units (RUs),
such as two [4], three [5], four [6], six [7], seven [8] and
eight [9] RUs. Each RU can be characterized as a ~50-residue-long 8-cysteine polypeptide, which includes a reactive site targeting serine proteinases. The evolution of
several members of this multi-domain family, at the gene
duplication level, has been reported (as the Pin2 family
[10]) in 2002. However, the complex correspondence
between sequence repeats and their 3D structure and the
molecular adaptation within this family has not been well
investigated.
Several 3D structures of the Pot II family are known
[1,2,11-15], belonging to the plant proteinase inhibitors
family by SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins)
[16] fold family of plant proteinase inhibitors. The plant
proteinase inhibitor family RUs adopts a variety of structural repeats, by circular permutation of the same fold
[1,2,14]. Structures exhibited by naturally occurring proteins are single- or double-chain permutated domains
composed of N- and C-terminal segments from sequence
repeats. The engineered putative ancestral domain protein
alone has a fold corresponding to the sequence repeat unit
[2].
We have investigated the correlation between sequence
and structural repeats within this family using sequence,
structural and phylogenetic analyses, with the putative
ancestral domain sequence as the basic repeat unit. Systematic analysis of Pot II family using bioinformatic
approaches has revealed many interesting findings, of
which the significant is the selection of the permuted
structural domain as the preferred structural repeat unit,
since it ensures the viability of proteinase inhibitory activity even as the native protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage.

Results and discussion
Protein 3D structures analysis of Pot II family
All the identified 3D structures of the Pot II family were
classified into plant proteinase inhibitors family by SCOP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S1/S22

[16]. Among these structures, only 1FYB and 1PJU are
two-domain PIs while the rest have a single domain. All
these structures have little secondary structure and are
restrained principally by four disulphide bridges in each
domain, and the main secondary structure in their folds is
an anti-parallel 3-stranded β-sheet on the face opposite to
the reactive site loop.
The sequence alignment of domains of the Pot II family
structures (Figure 1) suggests that the sequences of all
domains can mainly be divided into two parts, named
here as the H- and L-fragments (for heavy and light fragments) connected by Linker-1 or Linker-2. In most structures, the L-fragment forms the reactive loop and one
strand of the β-sheet, while the H-fragment forms a loop
and two strands.
From Figure 1, clearly all the structures share the same
disulfide connectivity although the combination of the Hand L-fragments is different. These domains can be
divided into three types based the existence of two linkers
(Linker-1 and Linker-2): (1) H-L type (H- and L-fragment
joined by Linker-1): with structural examples, 4SGB-I,
1TIH, 1FYBC, 1FYBT and 1PJU2; (2) L-H type (L- and Hfragment linked by Linker-2): the engineered protein
1CE3; (3) H+L type (No Linker-1 or Linker-2 between two
fragments): 1QH2 and 1PJU1.
The three structures shown in Figure 2 are actually the circular permutations of the same fold. All three topologies
have the β-sheet and the functional proteinase inhibitory
site conserved, although the intra-fragment connectivities
are different. The H+L structure (1PJU1) can be considered the basic fold, with Linker-1 between C2 and N1 in
4SGB-I and Linker-2 between C1 and N2 in 1CE3. The
existence of the H+L structure shows the viability of a twochain protease inhibitor in this fold family.
For an individual single-domain Pot II protein, it could
only have one topology from the three possible topologies depending on its primary sequence. But for a multiRU Pot II protein, theoretically there are two possible
domain organizations: (1) tandem repeat domain organization; (2) circularly permuted domain organization. For
tandem repeat domain organization, the domains are
arranged in beads-on-a-string way. Each domain is equivalent to the sequence repeat and adopts L-H topology.
While for circularly permuted domain organization, the
N- and C-termini are connected and formed one domain.
In such a bracelet-like organization, the structural
domains are not corresponding to the sequence repeats.
The domain formed by N- and C-terminal sequences
adopts H+L topology and other internal domains adopt
H-L topology.

So the problem is: given a multi-RU Pot II protein, which
kind of domain organization will it take? Based on the
observation of the current data set, all experimentally
determined multi-domain structures have circularly permuted two-domain organization (an H+L domain and an
H-L domain). And most single-domain Pot II PIs (often
derived from processing of multi-domain PIs) adopt the
H-L type topology which also suggests that the multidomain PIs have circularly permuted domain organization before they were processed. The only exception is
1CE3, which has only one RU in its primary sequence and
thus can only adopt L-H topology, and moreover it is a
engineered gene [2]. The abundance of H-L topology suggested it is more favourable by nature than L-H topology.
So the next question is: does H-L topology have advantage
(e.g. more stable or better packing) over L-H topology? To
evaluate the structure quality of different topologies and
domain organization, we used several structure validation
methods (WHATIF packing quality control [17], ERRAT
[18] and ProQ [19]) to compare representative structures
from each types. To facilitate the comparison, two 3-D
models (named PI2t1 and PI2t2) of a two-RU PI, Potato
Inhibitor II (PI-II) [Swiss-Prot: ], were built according to
tandem repeat domain organization and circularly permutated domain organization, respectively.
The structure validation methods used in this study evaluate the structure quality of protein models from different
aspects. WHATIF packing quality control is designed to
test the proper packing of protein models by evaluating
atomic contacts and calculating a contact quality index
[17]. ERRAT detects incorrectly determined regions of protein models by analyzing the statistics of non-bonded
interactions between different atom types [18]. The overall quality factor indicates the percentage of correctly
determined regions in the protein models. ProQ predicts
the quality of a protein model by using a neural-networkbased method that based on a number of structural features [19] using two different measures, LGscore [20] and
MaxSub [20]. For all the methods, higher value suggests

better structural quality. Based on the results showed in
Table 1, WHATIF packing quality control suggests that
permuted structures and H-L type structures have better
packing quality than tandem repeat and L-H type structures, especially for the fine packing quality control criteria. ERRAT and ProQ also recommend permuted
structures and H-L type topology have better structure
qualities and less problematic. Based on all above analyses, we believe that H-L type topology has better structure
quality and is more favourable than L-H type topology.
Therefore multi-domain Pot II proteins should tend to
fold as H-L topology domains.
The gene structure of Pot II family
Gene structures can potentially provide clues for the evolution of Pot II family. In 2002 Barta and colleagues
reported that the conserved gene structure for this family
being two exons separated by a 100–200 bp type I intron
(phase 1) [10]. With more sequences and genomic data
available, we resurveyed the gene structure and the
genomic distribution of the Pot II family genes. We first
collected exon/intron organization information for all
available Pot II family members. TBLASTN searches were
carried out with PI-II against the GenBank non-redundant
database as well as the Oryza sativa genome and the
assembled Arabidopsis thaliana genome from TIGR with
the default parameters. All the significant hits (which contain the common eight-cysteine motif of Pot II genes)
were combined, and only records that have complete coding sequence (CDS) information were retained. The final
dataset contains 30 genes, and all of them come from
plants. More specifically, most of them were from Solanaceous family species except one entry each from Arabidopsis
thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays. Only 13 entries from
the 30 genes have intron information available. Among
these 13 records, six are from Solanum tuberosum, four
from Lycopersicon esculentum and one each from Nicotiana
tabacum, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana.

The distribution and chromosomal locations of Pot II
genes can provide us the insights for the gene duplication

history and mechanisms of Pot family. For plants, currently the whole genome sequence data is only available
for Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. The distribution
of Pot II gene in the A. thaliana and O. sativa genome was
investigated using TBLASTN searches. The assembled
whole genome sequence for A. thaliana is available from
TIGR Arabidopsis thaliana Database http://www.tigr.org/
tdb/e2k1/ath1. The results show that there is only one
copy of the Pot II gene (named after AT-PI) in the entire A.
thaliana genome, with one RU [TIGR Arabidopsis thaliana
Genome Annotation Database Locus: F28P5.12]. The
putative Pot II gene in O. sativa (OS-PI) is from whole
genome shotgun sequence [GenBank: NM_001057714]
[21]. As with A. thaliana, rice has a single copy of the 1-RU
Pot II gene. Since there is only one copy of Pot II gene in
both A. thaliana and O. sativa, the current data cannot provide us more information about the chromosomal locations of duplicated Pot II genes.
We collected the exon and intron information for all
records and investigated their gene structures with the
assistance
of
the
Xpro
database
http://ori
gin.bic.nus.edu.sg/xpro/[22]. Interestingly, all the records
have similar gene structure including putative Pot II genes
from A. thaliana and O. sativa. First of all, all the records
have two exons. The first exon encodes a part of the signal
peptide (12–17 residues). The second exon encodes the
remaining part of the signal peptide (7–12 residues) and
the mature polypeptide. There is no intron between the
RUs in the genes of multi-RU sequences. Secondly, the
splice phases for all records are conserved as phase 1.
These results are consistent with the report by Barta et al.
[10]. Moreover, we found that the splicing motif is also
conserved and found to be GT...AG. The last nucleotide of
the exon 1 and the first two nucleotides of exon 2 always
encode a Gly residue. The conservation of exon/intron
organization, splice phase, splice motif and Gly residues
all confirm the homologous relationship between the
identified Pot II family members. The same gene structure
features are found in AT-PI and OS-PI, which are strongly
indicative of these two are also members of the Pot II family. Furthermore, we find that in all the Pot II family members lacking intron information, there is a conserved Gly
in a similar location in their signal peptides (data not
shown). These records come from a range of species of the
Solanaceae family, such as Solanum americanum, Solanum
nigrum, Nicotiana glutinosa, Nicotiana alata and Capsicum
annuum. These results confirmed that this Gly (formed by
the boundaries of two exons) in signal peptide is also a
conserved feature for Pot II family.
Both AT-PI and OS-PI have only one L-H type RU.
Although more than ten single-domain PI proteins (such
as PCI-1 [1]) have been reported, none of them was found
to be the direct translation product of a single-RU gene.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S1/S22

On the contrary, most of them are identical to a part of
multiple-domain PI precursors, indicating that these single-domain PIs are proteolytic products of multipledomain PIs. Considering the range of multiple-domain
PIs found in Solanacea, gene duplication mechanism has
been suggested to play an important role in the evolution
of the Pot II family members, with the ancestral gene having only one RU [2,10]. The characteristics of AT-PI and
OS-PI strongly support this hypothesis.
Protein sequence analysis
We collected the protein sequences of all Pot II family
members and putative Pot II PIs from the NCBI nonredundant protein database and dbEST database. After
removing duplicates, 40 non-redundant protein
sequences remained, with 95 RUs. We named the RUs
according
the
following
convention:
Total_number_repeats-Accession-Species-RU_number.
For example, PI3-IP22_LYCES-LE-R1 represents the first
repeat unit (R1) of the 3-RU (PI3) protein, IP22_LYCES
(Swiss-Prot names, accession numbers and GenBank
accession numbers are used whenever possible.) from Lycopersicon esculentum (LE). (Abbreviations for all species
used in this study are: AT, Arabidopsis thaliana; CA, Capsicum annuum; LE, Lycopersicon esculentum; LH, Lycopersicon
hirsutum; MC, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum; MT, Medicago truncatula; NA, Nicotiana alata; NE, Nicotiana attenuate; NG, Nicotiana glutinosa; NT, Nicotiana tabacum; OS,
Oryza sativa; SA, Solanum americanum; SH, Sorghum
halepense; SM, Solanum melongena; SN, Solanum nigrum;
SP, Solanum phureja; ST, Solanum tuberosum; ZM, Zea
mays).

From the consensus sequence of the multiple sequence
alignment of the 95 Pot II family RUs, the 8 Cys residues
are fully conserved. Besides these, other residues that are
highly conserved are two Gly residues and a Pro residue
(marked by arrows in Figure 3), probably having important roles in stabilizing the 3D structure of the protein.
The conservation degrees of the amino acid sites of Pot II
RUs were estimated by a Maximum Likelihood method
[23] and mapped to a reference 3D structure (PDB code:
1CE3) to identify functionally important regions by the
program ConSurf [24].
Figure 4 shows that distinct regions in the RUs of Pot II PIs
have very different conservation degrees. Besides the eight
fully conserved cysteines as structural scaffold in the core
region, a few highly conserved residues are also important
for maintaining the fold, such as Pro-18, Gly-38 and Gly46 (numbering according to 1CE3). The detailed analysis
reveals that they belong to three β-turns, respectively. For
example, the i+3 position of a type I β-turn is favored by a
Gly residue, which is Gly-46, in 1CE3. Its phi-psi angle

(80.3°, 63.7°) falls into the region that is not favored by
other residues, and makes it hard to be replaced by other
residues without distorting the fold. These 11 residues
including the eight cysteines, are structurally important
residues. Unlike most globular proteins, the reactive loop
in this domain is highly variable. The variability of the
reactive loop may allow the inhibitor to target varieties of
proteinases efficiently. The two linker regions between the
H- and the L-fragments (Figure 2), are also hypervariable
which suggests that they are less critical for the functionality of the Pot II domain. 1CE3 has only linker region 2
(Linker-2, shown in Figure 4) and does not have the linker
region 1, which is present in 4SGB-I (Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis of Pot II family
To investigate the evolution of Pot II family genes, the
phylogenetic analyses were carried out using NeighborJoining (NJ), Maximum-Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
inference methods, respectively. In all three trees, the taxa
can be clustered into seven clades by repeat number and
species. All 1-RU PIs cluster into one group, and they are
widely distributed in non-solanaceous plants. They are
more distantly related to other members of the Pot II family and are more likely the ancestral single domain Pot II
proteins. With only one RU, the sequence and the structural units are identical, with the L-H topology of 1CE3.
We have defined all these single-domain PIs as outgroup
(Clade 1) and re-rooted the trees. Figure 5 shows the NJ
tree (see Additional File 1 for the ML tree and Additional
File 2 for the MrBayes tree). The content of all clades are
same in all the trees. The main difference of the three trees
lies on the arrangement of clades. In all the trees, the basal
branchings (the relative arrangements of clades) are relatively weakly supported by bootstrap values or posterior
probability values. In NJ tree, Clade 2 (3rd RUs of 3-RU
PIs), 3 (1st RUs of 2-RU or 3-RU PIs) and 4 (2nd RUs of
2-RU or 3-RU PIs) are clustered together (they are RUs

from the same proteins), while in ML and MrBayes trees,
these three clades are clustered with other clades. From
current data, we cannot get better support information for
the relationship between clades. In this study, our analysis
does not depend on the relationship between clades and
the selection among the three trees doesn't affect our analysis later. Here we showed the NJ tree and the other two
trees are put into supplementary materials.
Figure 5 shows the inferred phylogenetic tree of 95 Pot II
RUs. All RUs are clustered into seven clades, according to
repeat number, species or total RU number. This clustering of RUs within each clade is strongly supported by the
high bootstrap proportions (BP) where the relative positions between clades are tentative because their BP values
are low. Clade 1 contains all (12 RUs) 1-RU Pot II PIs,
which exist in a wide range of species and are more likely
the ancient genes in Pot II family. The functionality or
inhibitor activity of these genes is unknown because of the
lack of experimental information. Clade 2 (5 RUs) comprises the third RUs of 3-RU PIs while Clade 3 (17 RUs)
and 4 (17 RUs) consist of the first and second RUs of 2RU and 3-RU PIs, respectively. Most of RUs in Clade 2, 3
and 4 are from Solanum genus plants. Clade 5 includes 8
RUs from paprika, and the sequence RUs in this clade are
H-L type, which is different with RUs in all other members
of Pot II family. Clade 6 (5 RUs) contains one 2-RU and
one 3-RU PIs from Solanum genus. Clade 7 (31 RUs)
includes 4-RU, 6-RU, 7-RU and 8-RU PIs from Nicotiana
genus.
There are mainly three features observed in the conservation patterns (Figure 5).
(1) RUs with the same repeat numbers are most similar.
The 2-RU and 3-RU PI from the Solanum genus (Clade 2,
3 and 4) contains 17 sequences, from 7 species with total

the "bracelet" link domain in other multi-RU PIs (H+L
type in Figure 1). As each domain adopts the H-L domain
topology, multiple-domain PIs from Capsicum annuum are
likely to adopt tandem structural domains with a "beadson-a-string" domain organization, which is different from
all other multiple-domain PIs in Pot II family. Strong
sequence similarity exists in this cluster at both protein
and nucleotide sequence levels.
We believe that naturally isolated L-H type single-domain
PIs can only be derived from single-RU genes, which are
present in Clade 1, so far recognized in rice, maize, etc.
Antcheva and colleagues reported the existence of a L-H
type single-domain protein, PSI-1.2 [31,32]. But we cannot find any multi-domain protein (from NCBI nr) contains PSI-1.2 or any nucleotide sequence (from NCBI nt
and dbEST) is corresponding to PSI-1.2. Therefore it is still
uncertain that PSI-1.2 is derived from a Pot II gene with
only one L-H type RU or it is the proteolytic processing
product of a multi-domain gene.

39 RUs, and is the largest group in this family. Here, the
first RU clusters into one clade as do the second RU and
the third RU. This suggests the duplication events happened before the speciation, although sequence similarity
cannot be detected at the DNA sequence level between
different repeats.
(2) Clade 5, 6, 7 contain repeats that are strikingly similar
to each other within the same genes. The similarity is even
clearly detectable at the DNA level (data not shown). Such
pattern cannot be explained by purifying selection since
the domain duplications usually loose the functional constraints and allow more mutations. The remarkable similarity suggests the existence of concerted evolution which
usually can be resulted by unequal crossing over and gene
conversion [25-27].
(3) In Clade 5, we have RUs from paprika that is very different to other members of the Solanacae species. Unlike
all the other groups, the RUs of the Pot II inhibitor from
Capsicum annuum are of the H-L type. The sequence repeat
is thus identical to the structural repeat observed in potato
and tomato and in Nicotiana (H-L type in Figure 1) and
has no N- and C-terminal sequence segments, which form

Analysis of selective pressure
Codon substitution models of were used to analyze Pot II
genes to identify amino acid sites under diversifying selection. The models used the nonsynonymous/synonymous
substitution rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) as an indicator of selection pressure and allowed the ratio to vary among sites.
The ω ratio of a site <1 indicates that the nonsynonymous
mutations at this site are deleterious and the site is under
purifying selection while ω >1 suggests that the nonsynonymous mutations at this site are beneficial and the site
should be under purifying selection.

Table 2 shows the parameters estimated under variable
selective pressure among sites using the unrooted tree
topology of Figure 5 without the out-group (PI1, singleRU Pot II genes). The average ω ratio ranges from 0.32 to
0.39 among all but the worst-fitting models. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) statistics (Table 3) suggested the
highly variable ω ratio among amino acid sites. For example, the null hypothesis model M0 (one ω ratio for all
sites) is rejected by a big margin when compared with
alternative hypothesis model M3 (discrete), which allows
for three classes of sites with different ω ratios. The LRT
statistic for this comparison is 235.12, which is much
greater than the critical value 13.28 at 0.01% level from a
χ2 distribution with d.f. = 4. The discrete model (M3) suggests a small proportion of sites (p2 = 2.1%) under positive selection, with ω2 = 4.621. This model fits the data
significantly better than M0 (one-ratio) or M1a (NearlyNeutral). Similarly, Model M8 (beta&ω) also suggests
2.1% of sites under diversifying selection with ω1 = 4.791.
The LRT statistic for comparing null hypothesis model M7
(beta) and alternative hypothesis M8 (beta&ω) is 25.70,
which is much greater than the critical value 9.21 at 0.01%

level with the χ2 distribution with d.f. = 2. M7 is thus
rejected in favour of M8. In sum, among all the models
tested, all models designed to detect positive selection
sites (M2a, M3 and M8) were significantly better than
their counterpart null hypothesis (M0, M1a and M7),
which provide consistent evidence for the presence of heterogeneous selection pressure among amino acid sites
within Pot II domains.

quite different between Clade 3, 4 and Clade 7. We are
interested in the variable selective pressure in different
clades. For Clade 3, 4 and 7 separately, we plotted the
approximate posterior mean of ω ratio at each site (Figure
6). Figure 6 shows that the majority of amino acid sites in
Clade 3 and Clade 4 are under purifying or neutral selection while Clade 7 has more amino acid sites under positive selection. In Clade 3 and Clade 4, site 5 (P1 site of
reactive loop) was identified as statistically significant
positive selected sites by all models (M2a, M3 and M8),
which is consistent with the previous analysis. While in
Clade 7, all models support strong positive selection over
site 19, which is the ending residue after the proteolytic
processing removing the Linker 2 region (highly conserved linker "EEKKN" in multi-RU Pot II PIs from Nicotiana genus).

Furthermore, all models allowed positive selection (M2a,
M3 and M8) converged to the same site, site 5. And site 5
had a high posterior probability (above the 99% level) of
being in the positively selected class in all models allowed
positive selection (M2a, M3 and M8).
Statistics analyses of variation of ω among sites provide
strong evidence of the positive selection. Interestingly, the
positively selected site 5 locates at P1 position of the reactive site of Pot II domains according the nomenclature of
the Schechter and Berger [28]. For standard mechanism,
canonical proteinaceous PIs of serine proteinases, the specificity of the inhibitors is determined, at least in part, by
a single residue at the P1 position [29]. In Pot II PI structures, the P1 residue contribute the largest number of contacts [3]. Therefore, the hypervariability and positive
selection of the P1residue in reactive site can be easily
understood since they allow the Pot II inhibitors to provide inhibition activity to a wide range of proteinases,
which help Solanaceae to fight against pathogenic attacks.

Such difference in selective pressure between Clade 3, 4
and Clade 7 may be due to the number of RUs. For twodomain Pot II PIs, the two domains can bind to two proteinases simultaneous without steric interference since the
two binding sites are at opposite ends of two inhibitor
domains (e.g. the bound form of TI-II) [12]. While for Pot
II PIs with more than two domains, it becomes more and
more difficult for each domain to bind a proteinase without steric hindrance. Heath and co-workers reported that
the six-domain precursor NA-PI only has stoichiometry of
2.6 trypsin [30]. So the efficiency of proteolytic processing
of multi-domain PIs may provide evolutionary advantages by performing better inhibition activity. This might
be a possible explanation why in Clade 7 the residue on
the cleavage sites is under positive selection.

We also conducted clade-wise site-based analyses in selective pressure on Clade 3 (1st RUs of 2-RU or 3-RU PIs),
Clade 4 (2nd RUs of 2-RU or 3-RU PIs) and Clade 7 (Similar RUs of multi-RU PIs from Nicotiana genus) in order
to detect the short period of positive Darwinian selection
within each clades.

Conclusion
We have carried out systematic analysis of Pot II family on
a significantly enlarged dataset comparing to the previous
study by Barta and colleagues [10], using a wide range of
bioinformatics analysis tools, leading to several interesting findings.

For all three clades, LRT tests support the existence of positive selected sites, but selective pressures among sites are

We classified the structural domains in Pot II family into
three types (H-L, L-H and H+L) according to the existence
of two linkers (Linker-1 and Linker-2) between the two
domain components (H-fragment and L-fragment),
which clearly show the circular permutation relationship
between the H-L type and L-H type topologies.
Based on observed domain organization or all known
sequences in Pot II family, there is a propensity in Pot II
PIs domain's topology to adopt the H-L topology (representative structure being 4SGB-I). Given that the repeat
unit for most multiple-RU Pot II PIs is of the L-H type,
such PIs will therefore fold into contiguous permuted
structural domains, linked by bracelet-like structures
formed by the N- and C-terminal segments from the first
and the last repeat units. For Pot II genes from paprika
alone, the repeat unit is of the H-L type, so that multipledomain PIs from paprika should adopt a simple tandem
permuted domain architecture, with no linking bracelet
structure, which is unique to the Pot II PI family.
The degree of conservation for each residue in the Pot II
PIs repeat units was evaluated and mapped onto the
molecular surface of the structure for the putative ancestral protein, 1CE3. The result shows that different regions
of the protein sequences have very different mutation
rates. Eight fully conserved cysteines form the scaffold in
the protein core, with the reactive loop and linker region
being highly variable. The rapid mutation of the reactive
site is consistent with the PIs possessing the ability to
adopt different specificities to target a wide range of proteinases. Three other highly conserved residues (two Gly's
and a Pro) are located at structurally important sites βturns and are thus critical for maintaining the Pot II
domain.
Phylogenetic analysis shows that the repeat units cluster
into several groups according to repeat number and species. The different similarities patterns between repeat
units in genes suggest that in different species the duplication history and mechanism should be different. Two 3repeat sequences from Capsicum annuum have evolved to
tailor the sequence repeats to correspond with the structural repeats thus eliminating the bracelet link. The repeat
unit for this group is a circular permutation of the ances-

tral domain, making this group the late entrant to the Pot
II family.
The analysis of selective pressure in Pot II domain
revealed heterogeneous selective pressures among amino
acid sites: the reactive site is under positive selection (providing different specificity to target varieties of proteinases) while the cysteine scaffold is under purifying
selection (essential for maintaining the fold). For multirepeat Pot II genes from Nicotiana genus, the proteolytic
processing site is under positive selection, which may be
related to higher efficiency for cleavage.
Overall, our results unravel the strategies adopted by
Solanaceae plants to fight against pests through the evolution of Pot II serine protease inhibitors. The duplications
in both gene level and domain level enable rapid and efficient expression of Pot II genes. On the structure level, the
multi-RU precursors can acquire circularly permutated
structures that have a more stable and thermodynamic
favourable folding. The molecular adaptation particularly
the positive selection over reactive sites provides various
inhibition activities targeting the broad range of pathogenic proteinases.

Methods
Collection of Pot II family members: structures, gene and
protein sequences
To identify 3D structures in Pot II family, PSI-BLAST [33]
was used to search against PDB [34] database with Potato
Inhibitor II (PI-II) [Swiss-Prot: ] [4] sequence. The PDB
codes for 7 retrieved structures are 4SGB[1], 1CE3[2],
1FYB[11], 1QH2[14], 1TIH[15], 1OYV[12], and
1PJU[13]. Among them, 1TIH, 1QH2 and 1FYB are from
one or two domains (T1, C2 and C1-T1 domain, respectively) of NA-PI [7], a six-domain precursor from Nicotiana alata. The engineered single domain proteinase
inhibitor, 1CE3, is the putative ancestral protein of Na-PI.
For NMR structures where the PDB entry comprises multiple conformers, NMRCLUST [35] has been used to
choose the representative structure. So the representative
structures for 1CE3, 1FYB and 1TIH are model 9, model 4
and model 5, respectively. These monomers are named
after 1CE3-9, 1FYB-4 and 1TIH-5. The structure of PCI-1,
which comes from chain I of 4SGB, is named after 4SGB-

The gene structure of Pot II family may provide hints for
evolution of the Pot II family. DNA sequences of Pot II
genes were retrieved through a search of GenBank nonredundant database with TBLASTN using PI-II. Only complete DNA sequences were retrieved. TBLASTN searches

were also performed against Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza
sativa genomes available from TIGR (The Institute for
Genomic Research, http://www.tigr.org/). The final dataset for Pot II genes was derived from the combination of
the results of all these searches followed by redundancy
removal and manual checking. The Accession numbers of
13 significant hits are AB110700, AK105387, AY007240,

PSI-BLAST was used to search against NCBI non-redundant protein database to retrieve protein sequences of the
Pot II family and TBLASTN was used to search against
NCBI dbEST database [36]. The search results were combined with the collection of Pfam [37] entry
Prot_inhib_II. Partial sequences and redundancies were
removed. The final sequence dataset includes 40 protein
sequences. The IDs (Swiss-Prot names, accession numbers

Protein structure analysis
The alignments of 3D structures were performed using
MULTI-GAFIT [38] and MALIGN3D algorithm in the
MODELLER package [39]. The structures were displayed
using RASMOL [40] and Swiss PDB Viewer [41]. Structural images were generated using YASARA (available
from http://www.yasara.org). To evaluate the two kinds of
domain organizations, MODELLER6v2 [39] was used to
build homology models for each type. The two models are
named after PI2t1 (tandem 2 domains, based on the template 1CE3) and PI2t2 (circularly permuted 2 domains,
using 1PJU as the template). The structures of different
types of topologies were compared to evaluate the structure qualities by using several structure validation methods, WHATIF Packing Quality Control [17], ProQ [19]
and ERRAT [18].
Gene structure analysis
The analysis of Pot II family gene structure (exon/inton
boundary, organization and splicing phase) were facilitated by Xpro [22] and EMBOSS [42]. The Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa genomes were downloaded from
TIGR.
Protein sequence analysis
The sequences of Pot II proteins were extracted and then
split into single Repeat Units (RUs) according to the putative ancestral domain sequence from 1CE3. The multiple
sequence alignments were carried out with CLUSTAL_X
[43] and followed by manual inspection and adjustment,
to maximize the alignment of identical and similar residues and minimize the number of gaps. The consensus
sequences were represented using Sequence Logos [44].
The degree of conservation of each amino acid was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S1/S22

assessed by the maximum-likelihood method [23] and
mapped onto the surface of the putative ancestral 3D
structure (1CE3) using ConSurf [23].
Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences were retrieved from NCBI Entrez
server and split into single RUs corresponding to putative
ancestral domain sequence from 1CE3. The alignment of
nucleotide sequences was facilitated by protal2dna server
http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/
protal2dna.html, based on the aligned amino acid
sequences. Phylogenetic analyses using Neighbor-Joining
(NJ), Maximum-Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference
were carried out using PHYLIP 3.66 [45] and MrBayes 3.1
[46,47]. For Neighbor-Joining method analysis, NEIGHBOR program in PHYLIP was used to infer the phylogenetic tree [48]. DNAML program [49] in PHYLIP was used
for ML analysis and the default parameters were used for
the model setting. Bootstrap analysis (1,000 replicates)
was done for both NJ and ML analysis to examine sampling error and local tree stability. For Bayesian inference,
General time reversible model (GTR+I+G) was suggested
as the best-fit model by MrModeltest 2.2 [50]. Bayesian
analysis was carried out using MrBayes 3.1 with the following parameters: 2.5 million generations, 4by4 nucleotide substitution, sampled every 100 generations, with the
consensus tree drawn using the last 20,000 trees. The trees
were displayed using TreeView [51].
Analyses of selective pressure
To examine the selective pressure acting on genes from
Pot II family, we only used sequences from Solanaceae
plants and excluded the single-RU Pot II genes since they
are not well annotated and we are not sure whether they
possess inhibition activity or not. The dataset included 83
RUs sequences from multi-RU Pot II genes after removing
12 single-RU genes. All the analyses were performed using
the CODEML module of the PAML 3.15 package [52].

Codon-substitution Models of variable ω (nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates ratio) among sites
were used to test for the existence of amino acid sites
under positive selection (with ω > 1) and to identify these
sites. We used several models (M0, M1a, M2a, M3, M7
and M8) recommended by Yang et al. [53,54]. Model M0
(one ratio) assumes invariable ω for all sites. Model M1a
(NearlyNeutral) assumes two classes of sites in the protein: the conserved sites at which 0 < ω < 1 and the neutral
sites at which ω = 1. In addition to the classes mentioned
for M1a, the M2a Model (PositiveSelection) adds a third
class of sites with ω as a free parameter, thus allowing for
sites with ω > 1. Model M3 (discrete) uses a general discrete distribution with three site classes, with proportions
(p0, p1, and p2) and the ω ratios (ω0, ω1, and ω2) estimated
from the data. Model M7 (beta) assumes a beta distribu-

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9(Suppl 1):S22

tion of ω (between 0 and 1) over sites depending on the
parameters p and q. Finally, Model M8 (beta&ω) adds an
extra class of sites to the beta (M7) model, therefore allowing ω values > 1. Among the above models, only Models
M2a, M3, and M8 can detect sites under positive selection.
From these models, Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) can be
done to test the positive selection hypothesis by comparing the simpler null hypothesis (M0, M1a and M7) with
their more complex alternative models (M3, M2a and
M8). All analyses were checked for convergence by performing the analysis with different starting ω values (0.3,
1 and 1.7). When the estimation of the parameters was
finished, both naive empirical Bayes (NEB) [55,56] and
Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) [57] approaches were used to
calculate the posterior probability for site classes. All statistics analyses were performed using the CODEML module in the PAML package [52].
Different Clades have distinct features and they may have
different selective pressure over different amino acid sites.
We conducted clade-wise site-based analyses in selective
pressure on Clade 3 (1st RUs of 2-RU or 3-RU PIs), Clade
4 (2nd RUs of 2-RU or 3-RU PIs) and Clade 7 (Similar RUs
of multi-RU PIs from Nicotiana genus). Other clades cannot be analyzed separately since they contain too few
sequences.
