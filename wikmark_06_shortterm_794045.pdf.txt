Abstract
Background: Ribosomal DNA of several species of the free-living Naegleria amoeba harbors an
optional group I intron within the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. The intron
(Nae.S516) has a complex organization of two ribozyme domains (NaGIR1 and NaGIR2) and a
homing endonuclease gene (NaHEG). NaGIR2 is responsible for intron excision, exon ligation, and
full-length intron RNA circularization, reactions typical for nuclear group I intron ribozymes.
NaGIR1, however, is essential for NaHEG expression by generating the 5' end of the homing
endonuclease messenger RNA. Interestingly, this unusual class of ribozyme adds a lariat-cap at the
mRNA.
Results: To elucidate the evolutionary history of the Nae.S516 twin-ribozyme introns we have
analyzed 13 natural variants present in distinct Naegleria isolates. Structural variabilities were noted
within both the ribozyme domains and provide strong comparative support to the intron
secondary structure. One of the introns, present in N. martinezi NG872, contains hallmarks of a
degenerated NaHEG. Phylogenetic analyses performed on separate data sets representing NaGIR1,
NaGIR2, NaHEG, and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA are consistent with an overall vertical
inheritance pattern of the intron within the Naegleria genus.
Conclusion: The Nae.S516 twin-ribozyme intron was gained early in the Naegleria evolution with
subsequent vertical inheritance. The intron was lost in the majority of isolates (70%), leaving a
widespread but scattered distribution pattern. Why the apparent asexual Naegleria amoebae
harbors active intron homing endonucleases, dependent on sexual reproduction for its function,
remains a puzzle.

Background
Naegleria is a common genus of soil and freshwater freeliving amoeba of the vahlkampfiid family [1]. Naegleria
apparently lack a sexual reproduction cycle since meiosis

never has been observed or proven experimentally. Subsequently, a number of genetically-defined variants have
been isolated in nature and proposed as distinct species
[1,2]. A typical Naegleria amoeba cell contains a distinct

nucleus with a large and predominant nucleolus containing as much as 3000–5000 copies of an approximately 14kb ribosomal DNA (rDNA) plasmid [3,4]. Each rDNA
molecule carries a single transcription unit for the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Some Naegleria isolates have
been reported to contain group I intron insertions at conserved sequence sites, both within the small subunit
(SSU) and large subunit (LSU) rRNA genes [5]. Introns
have been noted at position 516 in SSU rDNA (i.e. a position that is homologous to corresponding position in the
E. coli rRNA gene) and at positions 1921, 1926, 1949, and
2563 in LSU rDNA [5-11].
Group I introns are autocatalytic genetic elements carrying
a ribozyme domain responsible for the intron self-splicing reaction, and occasionally a homing endonuclease
gene (HEG) encoding an endonuclease protein directly
involved in intron mobility at the DNA level [12,13]. A
group I splicing ribozyme possess a well-defined threedimensional structure organized into three functional
domains (catalytic domain, folding domain, and substrate domain) by approximately ten paired RNA segments named P1–P10 [14,15]. The most common and
best characterized of the Naegleria rDNA introns is
Nae.S516. Group I introns at position 516 in SSU rDNA
are relatively common among eukaryotic microorganisms
with more than 250 cases reported so far [16,17], and
with both lateral and vertical inheritance patterns compared to that of host rDNA. A widespread distribution and
structural diversity among the S516 group I introns have
been noted, including several complex introns carrying
HEGs [16,18].
A typical Naegleria S516 intron has a twin-ribozyme
organization and represents the most complex class of all
group I introns known [19]. Nae.S516 consists of a small
group I-like mRNA capping ribozyme (NaGIR1) and a
HEG domain, both inserted into the P6b segment of a regular group IC1 splicing ribozyme (NaGIR2). Expression
and functional aspects of the Naegleria S516 intron have
been reported. The splicing ribozyme (NaGIR2) is responsible for the autocatalytic activity that generates intron
excision and exon ligation, as well as full-length intron
RNA circle formations [7]. The ability to form full-length
intron RNA circles is a general property of nuclear group I
introns and could be important in RNA mobility at the
RNA level, or even as an intermediate in the expression of
the homing endonuclease [11,20,21]. The Naegleria HEG
(NaHEG) encodes a 245 amino acid protein that belongs
to the His-Cys box family of homing endonucleases
[22,23]. The intron endonuclease recognizes and binds to
a 19-bp DNA sequence flanking the S516 rDNA site and
cleaves the DNA generating a five-nucleotide 3' staggered
end [24,25]. In general, group I intron endonucleases promote intron homing at the DNA-level by generating a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/39

double-stranded break in the intron-less target DNA, followed by invasion of the donor intron-containing allele
and DNA repair using the intron-containing allele as template [21]. However, sexual mating is the biological
framework for nuclear group I intron homing [26,27] and
it is unclear why the apparently asexual Naegleria contains
and maintains homing introns.
The expression of the NaHEG is dependent on a functional NaGIR1 ribozyme, which defines the 5' end of the
homing endonuclease mRNA by internal processing and
modification of the excised Nae.S516 intron [7,28,29].
Primer extension analyses of both cellular RNA from Naegleria and in vitro transcribed intron RNA [7,28] are consistent with the formation of a tiny lariat cap structure
between nucleotide 1 and 3 of the messenger, as recently
reported in the related DiGIR1 ribozyme [30]. Thus, the
NaGIR1 capping ribozyme represents a novel class of
ribozymes possessing a new catalytic function, which is
reflected in its unique RNA architecture [29,31].
The complex and unique structural organization of the
Naegleria twin-ribozyme intron makes it interesting to
investigate the evolutionary origin of the different intron
domains, as well as the inheritance pattern within the
Naegleria genus. Here we report several new intron variants and have performed sequence and phylogenetic analyses providing new insight into fundamental questions
such as intron structure, intron-host biology, and the origin and evolution of intron HEG and ribozyme domains.
The Naegleria twin-ribozyme intron serves as an attractive
model system in the characterization of evolutionary
processes behind a recently gained, but vertically inherited, selfish genetic element.

Results and discussion
Widespread but sporadic distribution of Nae.S516 introns
within the Naegleria genus
Sequence analysis of ITS-rDNA from 70 natural isolates of
Naegleria (Table 1) was performed to gain insight into the
genetic relationships among strains and species. A phylogenetic tree based on the NJ method is presented in Figure
1, and corroborates previous finding of six main clusters
of Naegleria isolates [1,2]. Most clusters appear monophyletic with high bootstrap and Bayesian supports, and
Cluster 5 is the most prominent with 30 annotated Naegleria isolates (Figure 1). A closer inspection of the SSU
rRNA identified intron sequences inserted at position
S516 in 21 of 70 strains analyzed. All introns, except one
[8], belong to the highly complex twin-ribozyme group I
intron family [7,19]. Group I introns at position 516 in
SSU rDNA are relatively common among eukaryotic
microorganisms [19]. Interestingly, the Naegleria 516
introns (Nae.S516; for intron nomenclature see [32]),
show a widespread but scattered distribution among the

Naegleria isolates (Figure 1). All clusters, except the early
diverging Cluster 6 [2], harbor isolates that carry the
group I intron. Furthermore, no linkages could be noted
between the presence of the S516 intron and environmental factors such as optimal growth temperature, pathogenesis, habitats, and geographical origin of Naegleria
isolates.
Structural features and sequence variability of intron
domains
Fourteen of the 21 introns were selected for more detail
structural characterizations (see Table 1). All introns, but
one (N. byersi NG597), possess the twin-ribozyme group
I intron organization previously reported [7,16], and an
updated RNA consensus structure diagram is shown in
Figure 2. The intron consists of three functional domains,
identified as distinct intron structures. The autocatalytic
Naegleria splicing ribozyme (NaGIR2) is responsible for
intron excision and exon ligation during precursor rRNA
processing in the Naegleria nucleolus, as well as for the
generation of circular intron RNAs [7,28]. NaGIR2 represents a typical group IC1 intron with clear structural
resemblance to the well-studied Tetrahymena ribozyme
[14,15]. The consensus structure (Figure 2) is strongly
supported by compensatory base substitutions among the
Naegleria introns. The most prominent differences
between the Naegleria and Tetrahymena ribozymes are the

lack of a P9.2 segment in Naegleria, the presence of an
optional tetra-loop in L5b, and a large sequence insertion
(approximately 950 nt) in P6b harboring the homing
endonuclease gene (NaHEG) and the capping ribozyme
NaGIR1 (Figure 2).
NaGIR1 is a group I-like ribozyme with an evolved biological role in intron NaHEG expression [29,30], likely to
generate a lariat cap-structure at the 5' end of the Naegleria
homing endonuclease messenger [30]. The three-dimensional architecture of NaGIR1 is related to that of bacterial
tRNA group I intron ribozymes [18,29,33], but with a
unique catalytic core organization that contains the novel
pseudoknot segment P15 [7,29,31,34]. As seen from Figure 2, most of the core nucleotides are highly conserved
among the various Naegleria capping ribozymes. Variable
regions are almost exclusively located in the terminal
loops of P6 and P8, the internal loop junction J5/4, and
sequences flanking NaGIR1 and NaHEG.
The third intron domain consists of the NaHEG which
codes for a 245 amino acid (aa) His-Cys endonuclease
that recognizes and cleaves the intron lacking allele
sequence in rDNA [24,25]. An alignment of the derived
amino acid sequence from the studied Naegleria introns is
presented in Figure 3. The amino acid identities between
pairs vary from 81 % to 100 %, with the positive charged

N-terminal region (first approximately 80 aa) as the most
variable part. The N-terminal region contain arginine and
lysine rich sequences that resembles known RNA binding
domains [35,36], indicating that the NaHEG encodes a
complex protein with both endonuclease and RNA binding functions. All three intron domains at the RNA-level
(NaGIR1, NaGIR2, endonuclease mRNA) are possible targets for intron protein RNA binding. Both NaGIR1 and
NaGIR2 are known to fold correctly and to be catalytically
active in vitro without assistance of proteins [7,31,34],
suggesting no essential maturase function of the intron
encoded protein. However, the intron protein could still
be able to bind to it own messenger, which is predicted to
be highly structured [7]. This possibility remains to be further experimentally explored. Residues previously noted
to be essential for endonuclease active site definition,
catalysis, and zinc coordination (Figure 3) [25] are highly
conserved. The non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) were calculated for the NaHEG
sequences and found in all cases to be below one (data
not shown), indicating purifying selection. Interestingly,
the intron present in N. martinezi NG872 isolate contains
hallmarks of a degenerated NaHEG, seen as multiple
frame shifts and small indels (Figure 3).

The splicing ribozyme of Nae.S516 intron is vertically
inherited in Naegleria
NaGIR2 represents the splicing-ribozyme domain of
Nae.S516 and thus corresponds to the sequences present
in a prototype group I intron such as the Tetrahymena
intron. We have previously performed phylogenetic analysis of various nuclear S516 group I introns, including five
NaGIR2 variants, and recognized the Naegleria introns as
a monophyletic clade among the group IC1 introns [16].
Here we extend the analysis to include 14 NaGIR2 variants representing the different isolates of Naegleria. Furthermore, we also include a host rDNA analysis based on
their corresponding ITS-rDNA sequences. The intron phylogeny was based on 356 sequence positions within
NaGIR2, strictly aligned according to the structure diagram in Figure 2. Different methods (NJ, MP, ML, and
BAY) were used to build the phylogenetic trees, and all
trees were essentially identically in topology. Similarly,
the ITS-rDNA phylogeny was based on 415 sequence positions using the same set of tree building methods
described above in intron analysis. Figure 4 shows representative NJ trees of both the ITS-rDNA and NaGIR2 phylogenies with overall congruent branching patterns and
significant bootstrap and Bayesian supports. The only
exception is N. italica AB-TF-3 (Figure 4), that could represent a recent horizontal intron transfer. However, the N.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:39

italica ITS-rDNA branch topology is only poorly supported in NJ analysis (77 %) and without bootstrap and
Bayesian supports in the MP, ML, and BAY analyses,
respectively. Thus, we infer there are no experimental support of horizontal intron transfer and conclude that the
NaGIR2 domain, representing the Nae.S516 intron, is vertically inherited within the Naegleria genus.
The capping ribozyme NaGIR1 and its downstream
NaHEG are evolutionary linked
Divergent evolutionary histories of group I splicing
ribozymes and their HEGs have been described in several
nuclear group I introns [37-39]. The Naegleria twinribozyme intron is highly unusual among group I introns
in that it contains two distinct structural domains
(NaGIR1 and NaHEG) inserted into the same peripheral
region (P6) of NaGIR2 (see Figure 2). To address the relationships among the variants of NaGIR1 and NaHEG, as
well as between the different intron domains (NaGIR1,
NaGIR2, and NaHEG) we performed phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence alignments. Figure 5 presents
representative NJ trees of NaGIR1 and NaHEG. The phylogenetic trees, built by the MP, ML, and BAY methods,
were essentially identical. The NaHEG tree was based on
747 aligned positions and possesses significant bootstrap
and Bayesian supports. The total size of the NaGIR1
domain is less than 250 nucleotides in size and thus only
230 positions could be included in the analysis. However,
we found the tree topology to be well supported in bootstrap and posterior probability analyses. Interestingly, the
NaGIR1, NaHEG, and NaGIR2 (compare Figures 4 and 5)
phylogenies were found to have congruent branching
topologies consistent with a co-evolutionary pattern of
the domains within introns. But there is one clear exception in N. carteri NG055 (see Figure 5), suggesting a
homologous recombination-like event between natural
sequence intron variants.

A Naegleria S516 group I intron with only NaHEG or only
NaGIR1 insertions has never been observed, suggesting a
strong linkage between the domains. Both structural and
functional data give further support to a close linkage
between the NaGIR1 and NaHEG domains. Jabri and
Cech [34] showed that the RNA structure essential for
NaGIR1 catalysis includes nucleotide residues within the
NaHEG coding region. Functional experiments in yeast
conclude that expression of NaHEG, and subsequent
endonuclease activity in yeast extracts, is completely
dependent on a functional NaGIR1 ribozyme [28]. Thus,
the NaGIR1 and NaHEG domains have to be considered
as one functional unit within the Nae.S516 intron.

Gain of a L5b GNRA tetraloop in NaGIR2 during
Naegleria evolution
One of the best-studied tetraloop receptor interaction is
the L5b-P6a tertiary structure in the Tetrahymena group I
intron ribozyme [40]. Here, the GAAA loop in L5b specifically binds to the 11-nt receptor motif CCUAAG-UAUGG
within the helical stem of P6a by docking into the shallow
groove. The L5b-P6a interaction in Tetrahymena is essential for an efficient folding of the P4–P6 domain, and subsequently the folding and activity of the splicing
ribozyme.

Two of the most variable parts in the Naegleria GIR2 splicing ribozyme are L5b and P6a (Figure 2). A closer inspection of the 13 twin-ribozyme intron sequences identify
tetra-, penta-, and hexaloops in L5b of 8, 4, and 1 introns,
respectively. All tetraloops belong to the GNRA family (N
= A, G, C or U; R = A or G) known to specifically interact
with receptor sequences. To address the distribution pattern of the L5b tetraloops among the various Naegleria
intron isolates a phylogenetic analysis based on 1370
positions, representing the complete twin-ribozyme
introns, was performed. Essential identical trees were
obtained from the NJ and MP methods, and a representative NJ tree is shown in Figure 6A. Interestingly, introns
harboring a L5b GNRA tetraloop cluster together with
high bootstrap support, suggesting that a L5b tetraloop
was gained late the evolution of the Naegleria genus. The
only exception appears the L5b pentaloop of the N. philippinensis RJTM intron (Figure 6A), but this example may
represent a secondary loss of a GNRA tetra-loop (e.g.
GUAA to AUAAA).
The primary function of GNRA tetraloops is to participate
in long-range RNA-RNA interactions by specific binding
to a receptor motif. A variety of receptor motifs, ranging
from 4 to 12 nt, have been recognized experimentally [4143]. Figure 6B presents secondary structure diagrams of
the various NaGIR2 P6a regions and their corresponding
L5b loops. A prominent difference in the P6a structure is
noted among introns possessing L5b GNRA tetraloops
compared to those with penta- or hexaloops. Introns with
GNRA loops contain a less tightly base-paired P6a stem
with several proposed exposed residues (see Figure 6B)
compared to the P5b penta- or hexaloop containing
introns (compare N. clarki RU30 and N. carteri NG055).
We speculate that the exposed residues in P6a could be
involved in RNA-RNA interactions as GNRA receptors.
However, these sequences do not fit any known consensus motifs, suggesting that new motifs are yet to be experimentally identified.

Evolutionary aspects on the structural organization of
Naegleria twin-ribozyme group I introns have been

reported previously [19]. Whereas the NaGIR2 splicing
ribozyme appears related to other eukaryote rDNA group
IC1 intron [16], the NaGIR1 capping ribozyme has
recently evolved from a bacterial tRNA group I introns
[29]. Here we present phylogenetic evidence of a vertical
inheritance pattern of the Nae.S516 intron in Naegleria
that includes each of the domains NaGIR1, NaGIR2, and
NaHEG, and corroborates a previous study based on 5
intron sequences [6]. Based on the reported distribution
pattern and phylogeny, we propose the following vertical
inheritance scenario for the Nae.S516 evolution. 1) A preorganized twin-ribozyme group I intron was gained in the
rDNA early in evolution of the Naegleria genus, but after
the Cluster 6 branching (see Figure 1). 2) Once established, the Naegleria intron co-evolved along with its host
rDNA by maintaining intron activities including intron
splicing, endonuclease mRNA capping, and homing
endonuclease DNA cleavage. 3) The intron was subsequently lost (see Figure 1) by sporadic deletions in most
isolates (70 %). 4) Degradation of the NaHEG is initiated
due to loss of biological function, and subsequent selection pressure (e.g. N. martinezi NG872), resulting in complete deletion of the NaHEG as well as its regulatory
NaGIR1 capping ribozyme (e.g. N. byersi NG597) [8]. 5)
The remaining introns have to improve and adjust their
functions by continuous sequence evolution in order to
be maintained within rDNA. Here, a recent gain of a
GNRA tetraloop receptor in the P4–P6 domain would
facilitate folding of the splicing ribozyme (Figure 6).
What is the biological role of a functional NaHEG in Naegleria S516 introns? There are only two reported examples
addressing the biological role of nuclear group I intron
HEGs in experimental settings. In sexual matings between
intron-containing and intron-lacking strains of either the
myxomycetes Physarum polycephalum or Didymium iridis,
group I introns were shown to be mobile due to the double-strand-break-repair pathway induced by intronencoded homing endonucleases [26,27]. In both cases the
homing endonucleases were found to cleave the group I
intron lacing alleles in a highly sequence specific manner,
resulting in unidirectional transfers of introns into the
intron-lacking strains. This process is dependent on a sexual reproduction of the host organism, which is apparently absent in Naegleria. However, the Naegleria intron
endonucleases possess hallmarks linked to a function in
intron homing. First, sequence comparisons show that the
Naegleria enzymes belong to the same His-Cys homing
endonuclease family as the known homing endonucleases I-PpoI and I-DirI encoded by the mobile Physarum and
Didymium group I introns [10,11,25]. Second, the Naegleria endonucleases cleave only intron lacking alleles flanking the intron insertion site at the SSU rRNA gene [24,25].
Finally, artificial expression of the Naegleria endonuclease
and its intron in yeast generate intron homing intermedi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/39

ates consistent with a homing endonuclease function
[28]. Interestingly, Naegleria may occasionally perform
sexual reproduction in nature since Pernin and co-workers [44,45] reported evidence for genetic exchange in N.
lovaniensis, including chromosomal recombination. Both
haploid and diploid strains of the N. gruberi NEG isolate
have been described based on both amoeba DNA content
and UV-sensitivity [46,47]. Perhaps the observed recombination-like feature of NaGIR1 in N. carteri NG055 (see
Figure 5) is a result of rare sexual mating. This possibility
remains to be experimentally explored.

The strains without designation are under revision and
will be proposed proper species names based on phylogenetic analyses of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences (De Jonckheere et al. in preparation). A complete list of all 70
Naegleria isolates included in this study is presented in
Table 1. DNA samples of Naegleria strains were prepared
as described previously [2], dissolved in water, and
applied as template in 50 µl standard PCR reactions.
Amplified product of interest were plasmid cloned into
the pGEM®-T Easy Vector System I (Promega). Individual
clones where DNA purified and sequenced with the ABI
PRISM BigDyeTerminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer), running on an ABI Prism 377 system (Perkin-Elmer), or using the sequencing service from
MWG Biotech [48]. Two or more individual clones were
sequenced from all introns and ITS-rDNA regions analysed. The following oligoprimers were used in Nae.S516
PCR amplifications and DNA sequencing analyses: OP 25
(5'-CTC GAA TTC GCT CTT GGA GCT GGA ATT A-3'), OP
26 (5'-ACG AAG CTT ATT TCT AAG CCT-3'), OP 28 (5'CAG AGG AGT TTC TTA CCT ATC-3'), OP 131 (5'-AAA
CGA ATT CTA TTG ATT AGT AGT-3'), OP 946 (5'-GAA
TTG AAA AAG CTT GAT-3'), OP 1200 (5'-AAA CAA ATG
CTA TTG ATC A-3'), OP 1201 (5'-GAA CGT CTA GAG ACT

276 (5'-GGT AAA CAA ATC CCT GTT-3'), OP 823 (5'-TAA
CCA TTT TGT ATG GGA-3'). Heteroplasmic rDNA alleles
(intron-containing/intron lacing) were not observed. The
following oligoprimers were used in ITS-rDNA PCR
amplifications and DNA sequencing analyses: OP 918 (5'AAC CTG CGT AGG GAT CAT TT-3'), OP 919 (5'-TTT CCT
CCC CTT ATT AAT AT-3').
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignment of sequences were performed by using
Megalign (Version 5.06) included in the Lasergene package from DNASTAR, Inc [49], Bioedit (Version 7.0.4.1;
[50]), manuel refinements. Phylogenetic analyses and
non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates [51]
were conducted using MEGA version 2.1 [52], PAUP*
(Version 4.0 Beta) [53], and MrBayes (version 3.1)
[54,55]. Trees were built with the methods of neighborjoining (NJ) using different distance matrixes, maximum
parsimony (MP) with the branch and bound search
method, as well as Bayesian analyses (BAY) and maximum likelihood (ML) using different evolutionary models. The reliabilities of the tree topologies were evaluated
by bootstrapping (NJ, MP, and ML), and posterior probability (BAY).
ITS and intron sequence analyses
Two different data sets of the internal transcribed rDNA
spacer region (ITS-rDNA: ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) were used. In
analysis with all the 70 Naegleria isolates, only 287 nucleotide positions could unambiguously be aligned due to
high sequence variation in ITS2. However, when the analysis was restricted to the 14 intron-containing Naegleria
isolates we extended the ITS-rDNA region to 415 nucleotide positions. Based on the multiple sequence alignment a NJ tree was constructed with the Kimura-2
evolutionary model of substitution (K2), with pair wise
deletion of gaps and bootstrapped with 2000 replications
with a cut-off value of 50%. Similarly, intron trees are constructed with NJ-K2 parameters. The robustness of the tree
topologies were tested by the NJ-K2 parameter (first
value), MP branch and bound search criteria (second
value), and ML with the HKY+G model of substitution
selected by Modeltest 3.7 [56], all from 1000 replicates.
The last values where constructed by running 1000000
generations of Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte
Carlo, and trees were sampled every 100 generations
(average standard deviation of split frequencies below
0.01). A consensus tree was generated from the 75% last
trees to find posterior probabilities (Burn-in value =
2500).
